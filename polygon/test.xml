               <p>To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the
                  following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous
                  delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate
                  friend, the author.</p>

            <div type="div3">
               <head>The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow</head>
               <p>SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to
                  write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the
                  end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because
                  there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace <date>17__</date>
                  and go back to the time when my father kept the <name>Admiral Benbow</name> inn and the brown
                  old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>
               <p>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his
                  sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow—a <list type="simple"><item>tall, </item><item>strong, </item><item>heavy, </item><item>nut-brown</item></list>
                  man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his
                  hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one
                  cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling
                  to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang
                  so often afterwards:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--</l>
                  <l>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"</l>
               </lg>
               <p>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the
                  capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that
                  he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a <choice><corr>glass</corr><sic>barrell</sic></choice> of rum. This,
                  when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a <corr>connoisseur</corr>, <corr>lingering</corr> on the
                  taste and still looking about him at the <choice><corr>cliffs</corr></choice> and up at our signboard.</p>
               <p>"This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant <sic>sittyated</sic> grog-shop<anchor xml:id="A1"/>.
                  Much company, mate?"</p>
               <p>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he cried<note xml:id="N1">fdslkjfd</note> to
                  the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and help up my chest. I'll
                  stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I
                  want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You
                  mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at—there"; and he threw down three
                  or four gold pieces on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through
                  that," says he, looking as fierce as a commander.</p>
