            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>This book was not made; it has grown.</p>
            <p>When three years ago I left the pulpit to engage in literary work
                                        and took my seat among the laity in the pews, I found that
                                        many ecclesiastical and religious subjects presented a
                                        different aspect from that which they had presented when I
                                        saw them from the pulpit. I commenced in the CHRISTIAN
                                        UNION, in a series of "Letters from a Layman," to discuss
                                        from my new point of view some questions which are generally
                                        discussed from the clerical point of view alone. The letters
                                        were kindly received by the public. To some of the
                                        characters introduced I became personally attached. And the
                                        series of letters, commenced with the expectation that they
                                        might last through six or eight weeks, extended over a
                                        period of more than a year and a half—<pb n="8"/> might perhaps have
                                        extended to the present it other duties had not usurped my
                                        time and thoughts.</p>
            <p>This was the beginning.</p>
            <p>But after a time thoughts and characters which presented
                                        themselves in isolated forms, and so were photographed for
                                        the columns of the newspaper, began to gather in groups. The
                                        single threads that had been spun for the weekly issue, wove
                                        themselves together in my imagination into the pattern of a
                                        simple story, true as to every substantial fact, yet
                                        fictitious in all its dress and form. And so out of Letters
                                        of Layman grew, I myself hardly know how, this simple story
                                        of a layman's life in a country parish.</p>
            <p>I cannot dismiss this book from my table without adding that I am
                                        conscious that the deepest problem it discusses is but
                                        barely touched upon. This has obtruded itself upon the
                                                pattern<pb n="9"/> in the
                                        weaving. It was intended for a single thread; but it has
                                        given color and character to all the rest. How shall
                                        Christian faith meet the current rationalism of the day? Not
                                        by argument; this is the thought I hope may be taught, or at
                                        least suggested, by the story of Mr. Gear's
                                        experience,—and it is a true not a fictitious
                                        story, except as all here is fictitious, abbri.e.
                                        in the external dress in which it is clothed. The very
                                        essence of rationalism is that it assumes that the reason is
                                        the highest faculty in man and the lord of all the rest.
                                        Grant this, as too often our controversial theology does
                                        grant it, and the battle is yielded before it is begun.
                                        Whether that rationalism leads to orthodox or heterodox
                                        conclusions, whether it issues in a Westminster Assembly's
                                        Confession of faith or a Positivist Primer is a matter of
                                        secondary importance. Religion is not a conclusion of the
                                        reason. The reason is not the lord of the spiritual
                                                domain.<pb n="10"/> There is
                                        a world which it never sees and with which it is wholly
                                        incompetent to deal. And Christian faith wins its victories
                                        only when by its own-heart life it gives some glimpse of
                                        this hidden world and sends the rationalist, Columbus-like,
                                        on an unknown sea to search for this unknown continent.</p>
            <p>I am not sure whether this preface had not better have remained
                                        unwritten; whether the parable had not better be left
                                        without an interpretation. But it is written and it shall
                                        stand. And so this simple story goes from my hands, I trust
                                        to do some little good, by hinting to clerical readers how
                                        some problems concerning Christian work appear to a layman's
                                        mind, and by quickening lay readers to share more generously
                                        in their pastors' labors and to understand more
                                        sympathetically their pastor's trials.</p>

            <head type="sub">How I happened to go to Wheathedge.</head>
            <p>ABOUT sixty miles north of New York city,—not as the
                                        crow flies, for of the course of that bird I have no
                                        knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief, but as
                                        the <name>Mary Powell</name> ploughs her way up the tortuous
                                        channel of the Hudson river,—lies the little
                                        village of Wheathedge. A more beautiful site even this most
                                        beautiful of rivers does not possess. As I sit now in my
                                        library, I raise my eyes from my writing and look east to
                                        see the morning sun just rising in the gap and pouring a
                                        long golden flood of light upon the awaking village below
                                        and about me, and gilding the spires of the not far distant
                                        city of Newtown,<pb n="12"/> and
                                        making even its smoke ethereal, as though throngs of angels
                                        hung over the city unrecognized by its too busy inhabitants.
                                        Before me the majestic river broadens out into a bay where
                                        now the ice-boats play back and forth, and day after day is
                                        repeated the merry dance of many skaters—about the
                                        only kind of dance I thoroughly believe in. If I stand on
                                        the porch upon which one of my library windows opens, and
                                        look to the east, I see the mountain clad with its primeval
                                        forest, crowding down to the water's edge. It looks as
                                        though one might naturally expect to come upon a camp of
                                        Indian wigwams there. Two years ago a wild-cat was shot in
                                        those same woods and stuffed by the hunters, and it still
                                        stands in the ante-room of the public school, the first, and
                                        last, and only contribution to an incipient museum of
                                        natural history which the sole scientific enthusiast of
                                        Wheathedge has founded—in imagination. Last year
                                        Harry stumbled on a whole nest of rattlesnakes, to his and
                                        their infinite alarm—and to ours too when
                                        afterwards he told us the story of his adventure. If I turn
                                        and look to the other side of the river, I see a broad
                                                and<pb n="13"/> laughing
                                        valley,—grim in the beautiful death of winter now
                                        however,—through which the Newtown railroad, like
                                        the Star of Empire, westward takes its way. For the village
                                        of Wheathedge, scattered along the mountain side, looks down
                                        from its elevated situation on a wide expanse of country.
                                        Like Jerusalem of old,—only, if I can judge
                                        anything from the accounts of Palestinian travelers, a good
                                        deal more so,—it is beautiful for situation, and
                                        deserves to be the joy of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>A village I have called it. It certainly is neither town nor
                                        city. There is a little centre where there is a livery
                                        stable, and a country store with the Post Office attached,
                                        and a blacksmith shop, and two churches, a Methodist and a
                                        Presbyterian, with the promise of a Baptist church in a
                                        lecture-room as yet unfinished. This is the old centre;
                                        there is another down under the hill where there is a dock,
                                        and a railroad station, and a great hotel with a big bar and
                                        generally a knot of loungers who evidently do not believe in
                                        the water-cure. And between the two there is a constant
                                        battle as to which shall be the town. For the rest, there is
                                        a road <orig>wan-</orig>
               <pb n="14"/> dering in an aimless
                                        way along the hill-side, like a child at play who is going
                                        nowhere, and all along this road are scattered every variety
                                        of dwelling, big and little, sombre and gay, humble and
                                        pretentious, which the mind of man ever conceived
                                        of,—and some of which I devoutly trust the mind of
                                        man will never again conceive. There are solid substantial
                                        Dutch farm-houses, built of unhewn stone, that look as
                                        though they were outgrowths of the mountain, which nothing
                                        short of an earthquake could disturb; and there are fragile
                                        little boxes that look as though they would be swept away,
                                        to be seen no more forever, by the first winter's blast that
                                        comes tearing up the gap as though the bag of Eolus had just
                                        been opened at West Point and the imprisoned winds were off
                                        with a whoop for a lark. There are houses in sombre grays
                                        with trimmings of the same; and there are houses in every
                                        variety of color, including one that is of a light
                                        pea-green, with pink trimmings and blue blinds. There are
                                        old and venerable houses, that look as though they might
                                        have come over with Peter Stuyvesant and been living at
                                        Wheathedge ever since; and there are spruce little sprigs
                                                of<pb n="15"/> houses
                                        that look as though they had just come up from New York to
                                        spend a holiday, and did not rightly know what to do with
                                        themselves in the country. There are staid and respectable
                                        mansions that never move from the even tenor of their ways;
                                        and there are houses that change their fashions every
                                        season, putting on a new coat of paint every spring; and
                                        there is one that dresses itself out in summer with so many
                                        flags and streamers that one might imagine Fourth of July
                                        lived there.</p>
            <p>All nations and all eras appear also to be gathered here. There
                                        are Swiss cottages with overhanging chambers, and Italian
                                        villas with flat roofs, and Gothic structures with incipient
                                        spires that look as though they had stopped in their
                                        childhood and never got their growth, and Grecian temples
                                        with rows of wooden imitations of marble pillars of Doric
                                        architecture, and one house in which all nations and eras
                                        combine—a Grecian porch, a Gothic roof, an Italian
                                        L, and a half finished tower of the Elizabethan era, capped
                                        with a Moorish dome, the whole approached through the
                                        stiffest of all stiff avenues of evergreens, trimmed in the
                                        latest French fashion.<pb n="16"/> That is
                                        Mr. Wheaton's residence, the millionaire of Wheathedge. I
                                        wish I could say he was as Catholic as his dwelling house.</p>
            <p>I never fancied the country. Its numerous attractions were no
                                        attractions to me. I cannot harness a horse. I am afraid of
                                        a cow. I have no fondness for chickens—unless they
                                        are tender and well-cooked. Like the man in parable, I
                                        cannot dig. I abhor a hoe. I am fond of flowers but not of
                                        dirt, and had rather buy them than cultivate them. Of all
                                        ambition to get the earliest crop of green peas and half
                                        ripe strawberries I am innocent. I like to walk in my
                                        neighbor's garden better than to work in my own. I do not
                                        drink milk, and I do drink coffee; and I had rather run my
                                        risk with the average of city milk than with the average of
                                        country coffee. Fresh air is very desirable; but the air on
                                        the bleak hills of the Hudson in March is at times a trifle
                                        too fresh. The pure snow as it lies on field, and fence, and
                                        tree, is beautiful, I confess. But when one goes out to
                                        walk, it is convenient to have the sidewalks shoveled.</p>
            <p>At least that is what I used to think five<pb n="17"/> years ago. And if my wife had
                                        endeavored to argue me out of my convictions, she would only
                                        have strengthened them. But my wife:—</p>
            <p>Stop a minute. I may as well say here that this book is written
                                        in confidence. It is personal. It deals with the interior
                                        history of a very respectable church and some most
                                        respectable families. It contains a great deal that is not
                                        proper to be communicated to the public. The reader will
                                        please bear this in mind. Whatever I say, particularly what
                                        I am going to say now, is confidential. Don't mention it.</p>
            <p>My wife is a diplomate. If ever I am president of the United
                                        States—which may Heaven forbid,—she
                                        shall be secretary of State. She never argues; but she
                                        always carries her point.</p>
            <p>She always lets me have my own way without hinting an objection.
                                        But it always ends in her having her own. She would have
                                        made no objection to letting Mason and Slidell
                                        go—not the least in the world. But she would have
                                        somehow induced England to entreat us to take them
                                        back—I am sure of it. She would not have dismissed
                                        Catacazy—not she. But if she did not like
                                        Catacazy, Gortschakoff should<pb n="18"/>
                                        have recalled him, and never known why he did it.</p>
            <p>"John," said my wife, "where shall we spend the summer?"</p>
            <p>It was six years ago this spring. We were sitting in the library
                                        in our city house, Harry was a baby; and baby was not. I
                                        laid down the <title>Evening Post</title>, and looked up
                                        with an incipient groan.</p>
            <p>"The usual way I suppose," said I. "You'll go home with the baby,
                                        and I—I shall camp out in New York."</p>
            <p>"Home" is Jennie's home in Michigan, where she had spent two of
                                        the three summers of our married life, while I existed in
                                        single misery in my empty house in 38th street. Oh, the
                                        desolateness of those summer experiences. Oh, the
                                        unutterable loneliness of a house without the smile of the
                                        dear wife, and the laugh and prattle of the baby boy. I even
                                        missed his cry at night.</p>
            <p>"It's a long, long journey," said Jennie, "and a long, long way
                                        off; and I did resolve last summer I never would put a
                                        thousand miles again between me and my true home, John. For
                                        that is not my home—you are my home."</p>
            <pb n="19"/>
            <p>And a soft hand stole gently up and toyed with my hair.</p>
            <p>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, saith the preacher. To which I
                                        add, especially husbands. No man is proof against the
                                        flatteries of love. At least I am not, and I am glad of it.</p>
            <p>"You can't stay here, Jennie," said I.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid not," said she. "It is Harry's second summer, and I
                                        would not dare."</p>
            <p>"The sea shore?" said I, interrogatively.</p>
            <p>"Not one of those great fashionable hotels, John. It would be
                                        worse for Harry than the city. And then think of the cost."</p>
            <p>"True," said I reflectively. "I wish we could find a quiet place,
                                        not too far from the city so that I could come in and out
                                        during term time, and stay out altogether during the summer
                                        vacation."</p>
            <p>"There must be some such, many such," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"But to look for them," said I, "would be, to use an entirely new
                                        simile, like looking for a needle in a haystack. There must
                                        be some honest lawyers at the New York bar, and some<pb n="20"/> impartial judges on
                                        the New York bench, but I should not like to be set to find
                                        them."</p>
            <p>I had been beaten in an important case that afternoon and was out
                                        with my profession.</p>
            <p>"Suppose you let me try," said Jennie—"that is to find
                                        the quiet summer retreat, not the honest lawyer."</p>
            <p>"By all means, my dear," said I. "And I have great confidence
                                        that if you are patient and assiduous, you will find a place
                                        in time for Harry to settle down in comfortably when he gets
                                        ready to be married."</p>
            <p>Jennie laughed a quiet little laugh at my incredulity, and sat
                                        straightway down to write half a dozen letters of inquiry to
                                        as many different friends in the environs of New York. I
                                        resumed the <title>Evening Post</title>. As to anything
                                        coming of her plans I no more dreamt of it than your
                                        grandfather, reader, dreamt of the Atlantic cable.</p>
            <p>But though I had been married three years I did not know Jennie
                                        then as well as I know her now. I have since learned that
                                        she has a habit of accomplishing what she undertakes. But
                                        this again is strictly confidential.</p>
            <p>That June saw us snugly ensconced at Mr.<pb n="21"/> Lines'. Glen-Ridge is the euphonious
                                        title he has given to his pretty but unpretending place.
                                        Jennie had written among others to Sophie Wheaton, née Sophie Nichols,
                                        an old school-fellow, and Sophie had sent down an invitation
                                        to her to come and spend a week and look for herself, and
                                        she had done so; save that two days had sufficed instead of
                                        a week. Glen-Ridge had taken her fancy, Mr. Lines had met
                                        her housewifely idea of a good house-keeper, and she had
                                        selected the rooms and agreed on terms, and left nothing for
                                        me to do except to ratify the bargain by a letter, which I
                                        did the day after her return. And so in the early summer of
                                        1866 the diplomate had carried her first point, and
                                        committed me to two months' probation in the country; and
                                        two very delightful months they were.</p>

            <head type="sub">More Diplomacy.</head>
            <p>I now verily believe that Jennie from the first had made up her
                                        mind that we were to settle in Wheathedge. Though I never
                                        liked the country, she did. And I now think that summer at
                                        Wheathedge was her first step toward a settlement there. But
                                        she never hinted it to me.</p>
            <p>Not she. On the contrary, she often went down to the city with
                                        me, and shortened the car ride by half. We kept the city
                                        house open. She exercised a watchful supervision over the
                                        cook. The sheets were not damp, the coffee was not muddy,
                                        the library table was not covered with dust. I blessed her a
                                        hundred times a week for the love that found us both this
                                        Wheathedge home, and made the city home so comfortable and
                                        cosy. Yet I came to my house in the city less and less. The
                                        car ride grew shorter every week. When the courts closed and
                                        the long vacation, arrived I bade the cook an indefinite
                                        good-bye. My clients had to conform to the<pb n="23"/> new office hours, 10 to
                                        3, with Saturdays struck off the office calendar, and, in
                                        the dog days, Mondays too. Yet I was within call, and
                                        business ran smoothly. The country looked brighter than it
                                        used to do. I learned to enjoy the glorious sunrise that New
                                        Yorkers never see. I discovered that there were other
                                        indications of a moonlight night than the fact that the
                                        street lamps were not lighted. Harry grew fat and rosy, and
                                        his little chuckle developed into a lusty laugh. Jennie's
                                        headaches were blown away by the fresh air that came down
                                        from the north. I found the fragrance of the new mown hay
                                        from the Glen-Rridge meadow
                                        more agreeable than the fragrant odors which the westerly
                                        winds waft over to Murray Hill from the bone boiling
                                        establishments of the Hudson river. Every evening Jennie met
                                        me at the train with Tom—Mr. Lines' best horse,
                                        whom I liked so well that I hired him for the season; and we
                                        took long drives and renewed the scenes of five years
                                        before, when Jennie was Jennie Malcolm, and I was just
                                        graduating from Harvard law-school. And still the diplomate
                                        never hinted at the idea of making a home at Wheathedge.</p>
            <pb n="24"/>
            <p>But one day as we drove by Mr. Sinclair's she remarked casually,
                                        "What a pretty place!"</p>
            <p>It was a pretty place. A little cottage, French gray with darker
                                        trimmings of the same; the tastiest little porch with a
                                        something or other—I know the vine by sight but
                                        not to this day by name—creeping over it, and
                                        converting it into a bower; another porch fragrant with
                                        climbing roses and musical with the twittering of young
                                        swallows who had made their nests in little chambers
                                        curiously constructed under the eaves and hidden among the
                                        sheltering leaves; a green sward sweeping down to the road,
                                        with a few grand old forest trees scattered carelessly about
                                        as though nature had been the landscape gardner; and
                                        prettiest of all, a little boy and girl playing horse upon
                                        the gravel walk, and filling the air with shouts of merry
                                        laughter—all this combined to make as pretty a
                                        picture as one would wish to see. The western sun poured a
                                        flood of light upon it through crimson clouds, and a soft
                                        glory from the dying day made this little Eden of earth more
                                        radiant by a baptism from heaven.</p>
            <p>I wonder now if Jennie had been waiting for<pb n="25"/> a favorable opportunity
                                        and then had spoken. I do not know; and she will never tell
                                        me. At all events the beauty so struck me, like a landscape
                                        fresh from the hand of some great artist—as it was
                                        indeed, fresh from the hand of the Great
                                        Artist—that I involuntarily reined in Tom to look
                                        at it. "It's for sale, too," said I, "I wonder what such a
                                        place costs."</p>
            <p>The artful diplomate did not answer. The books and newspapers
                                        talk about women's curiosity. It's nothing to a man's
                                        curiosity when it is aroused. Oh, I know the story of
                                        Bluebeard very well. But if Mrs. Bluebeard had been a strong
                                        minded woman, and had killed her seven husbands, I wonder if
                                        the eighth would not have taken a peep. He would not have
                                        waited for the key but would have broken in the door long
                                        before. If men are not curious why do the authorities always
                                        appoint them on the detective police force?</p>
            <p>"Mr. Lines," said I that evening at the tea table, "you know that
                                        pretty little cottage on the hill just opposite the church.
                                        I see there is a sign up 'for sale.' What is the price of
                                        it, do you know?"</p>
            <pb n="26"/>
            <p>"No," said Mr. Lines. "But you can easily find out. It belongs to
                                        Charlie Sinclair; he lives there and can tell you."</p>
            <p>Three days after that, as I was driving up from the station, it
                                        struck my fancy I should like to see the inside of that
                                        pretty house. "Jennie," said I, "let's go in and look at the
                                        inside of that pretty cottage." But I had no more idea of
                                        purchasing it than I have now of purchasing the moon.</p>
            <p>"It would hardly be the thing for me to call," said the
                                        diplomate. "Mrs. Sinclair has never called on me."</p>
            <p>"I don't want you to make any call," said I. "The house is for
                                        sale. I am a New Yorker. I am looking about Wheathedge for a
                                        place. I see this place is for sale. I should like to look
                                        at it. And of course my wife must look at it too."</p>
            <p>"Oh! that indeed," said my wife, "that's another matter. I have
                                        no particular objection to that."</p>
            <p>"Besides," said I, "I really should like to know the price of
                                        such a place in Wheathedge."</p>
            <p>"Very good," said Jennie.</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p>So we drove up to the gate, fastened the horse, and inquired of
                                        Mrs. Sinclair, who came in person to the door, if we could
                                        see the house. Certainly. She would be very happy to show it
                                        to us. And a very pretty house it was—and is
                                        still. There was a cozy little parlor with a bay window
                                        looking out on the river, there was an equally cozy little
                                        dining-room, and there was an L for a
                                        sitting-room—which I instantly converted in my
                                        imagination into a library—which looked with one
                                        window on the river and with another on the mountains. There
                                        was a very convenient kitchen built out in a wing from one
                                        end of the dining-room, and three chambers over the three
                                        downstairs rooms, from the larger one of which, over the
                                        sitting-room, we could take in at a glance the Presbyterian
                                        church, the blacksmith's shop, and the country store, with
                                        the wandering and aimless road, and a score or two of
                                        neighbor's homes which lay along it; for the cottage was on
                                        the hillside, and elevated considerably above the main
                                        roadway. It was charmingly furnished too, and was full of
                                        the fragrance of flowers within, as it was embowered in them
                                        without.</p>
            <pb n="28"/>
            <p>Besides looking at the house we asked the usual house-hunting
                                        questions. Mr. Sinclair was in the city. He wanted to sell
                                        because he was going to Europe in the spring to educate his
                                        children. He would sell his place for $10,000 or rent it for
                                        $800. For the summer? No! for the year. He did not care to
                                        rent it for the summer, nor to give possession before fall.
                                        Would he rent the furniture? Yes, if one wanted it. But that
                                        would be extra. How much land was there? About two acres.
                                        Any fruit? Pears, peaches, and the smaller
                                        fruits—strawberries, raspberries, and
                                        blackberries. Whereupon Jennie and I bowed ourselves out and
                                        went away.</p>
            <p>And nothing more was said about it till the next February. The
                                        diplomate still kept her own counsel.</p>
            <p>Then I opened the subject. It was the evening of the first day of
                                        February. I had been in to pay my rent. "Jennie," said I,
                                        "the landlord raises our rent to $2,500.</p>
            <p>"What are you going to do?" said she quietly; "pay it?"</p>
            <p>"Pay it!" said I. "No. It's high at $2,000.—We shall
                                        have to move."</p>
            <pb n="29"/>
            <p>"Where to?" said Jennie.</p>
            <p>I shrugged my shoulders. I had not the least idea.</p>
            <p>"What are you going to do next summer?" said she.</p>
            <p>"Glen-Ridge?" said I interrogatively.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid I shall have to be in my own home next summer," said
                                        Jennie. "The mother cannot leave her nest to find a home
                                        among strangers when God sends her a little bird to be
                                        watched and tended. And I hope, John, God is going to send
                                        another little bird to our nest this summer."</p>
            <p>"You shall have your own home, Jennie dear," said I. "I will tell
                                        the landlord to-morrow that we will keep it. But it is an
                                        imposition."</p>
            <p>"I am so sorry to give up our summer at Wheathedge," said she.
                                        "We did enjoy ourselves so much, John, and Harry grew and
                                        thrived so."</p>
            <p>"It can't be helped, Jennie," said I.</p>
            <p>"No"—said she slowly, and as if thinking to herself;
                                        "no—unless we took the Sinclair cottage for the
                                        summer."</p>
            <p>"I hadn't thought of that," said I.</p>
            <pb n="30"/>
            <p>"What was the rent?" asked the diplomate. She knew as well as I
                                        did.</p>
            <p>"Eight hundred dollars a year," said I.</p>
            <p>"That is a clear saving of $1,700 a year," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"That's a fact," said I.</p>
            <p>"If we did not like it we could come back to the city in the
                                        fall, and get a house here; if we did we could stay later
                                        and come in to board for three or four months. I shouldn't
                                        mind if we did not come at all."</p>
            <p>"No country in the winter for me, thank you," said I; "with the
                                        wind drawing through the open cracks in your country built
                                        house half freezing you, and when you try to keep warm your
                                        air-tight stove half suffocating you; with the roads outside
                                        blocked up with great drifts, and the trains delayed just on
                                        the days when I have a critical case in court."</p>
            <p>"Very well," said Jennie. She is too much of a diplomate to
                                        argue. "When the snow comes we can easily move back again,
                                        as easily as find a new house now. To tell the truth, John,
                                        I have no heart for house-hunting now."</p>
            <p>"Well," said I. "I will see Sinclair to-morrow.<pb n="31"/> And if his house is in
                                        the market, Jennie, we we will move there as soon as the
                                        spring fairly opens."</p>
            <p>It was in the market. He was anxious to be rid of it. I hired it
                                        for the year, together with the furniture, at
                                        $800,—and he agreed that if I bought it in the
                                        Fall the half year rent should go on the purchase money. I
                                        did not pay him any rent. I did not move into the city when
                                        the snow came. The diplomate had her own way as she always
                                        does. We live in the country; and I—I am very glad
                                        of it. I can harness Katie on a pinch. I am not afraid of
                                        the cow. I am not skilful with the hoe, but I am as proud of
                                        my flower garden as any of my neighbors. And as to the
                                        relative advantages of city and country, I am quite of the
                                        opinion of Harry.</p>
            <p>"Harry," said his grandfather the other day, "don't you want to
                                        go back to the city and live?"</p>
            <p>"No!" said Harry, with the utmost expression of scorn on his
                                        face.</p>
            <p>"Why not, Harry?"</p>
            <p>"It smells so."</p>

            <p>"I have bought the house, Jennie," said I.</p>
            <p>"Thank you," said Jennie. She said it softly, but her eyes said
                                        it more plainly than her voice. I had hesitated a little
                                        before I finally closed the purchase. But Jennie's look and
                                        her soft "Thank you" made me sure I had been right.</p>
            <p>Since the baby has come we have converted the chamber over the
                                        library into an upstairs sitting-room. I found her there
                                        before the open fire, on my return from New York. The baby
                                        was sleeping in her arms; and she was gently rocking him,
                                        pressed close to her bosom.</p>
            <p>"I wish you would have a nurse for the baby, Jennie," said I. "I
                                        don't like to see you tied to her so."</p>
            <p>"You wouldn't take baby from me would you, John?" said she
                                        appealingly, nestling the precious bundle closer to her
                                        heart than before, as if<pb n="33"/> in apprehension. No I wouldn't. I
                                        was obliged to confess that, to myself if not to her.</p>
            <p>"John," said Jennie, "Mrs Goodsole has been here this afternoon.
                                        She wants to know if we won't take our letters to this
                                        church the next communion. It is the first of September."</p>
            <p>"Well?" said I, for Jennie had stopped.</p>
            <p>"She says that if we are going to make Wheathedge our home she
                                        hopes we can find a pleasant home in the church here. I told
                                        her I could not tell, we had only hired the house for the
                                        summer and might leave in the fall. But if you have bought
                                        it, John, and I am, oh! so glad you have and thank you so
                                        much"—one hand left the baby gently, and was laid
                                        on my arm with the softest possible pressure by way of
                                        emphasizing the thanks again,—"perhaps we ought to
                                        consider it."</p>
            <p>"I have no notion of joining this church," said I. "It's in debt,
                                        and always behind hand. I am told they owe a hundred dollars
                                        to their minister now."</p>
            <p>"That's too bad," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"And we can't do much if we do join it. I have no time for church
                                        affairs, and you—you<pb n="34"/>
                                        have all you can do to attend to your infant class at home,
                                        Jennie."</p>
            <p>"That's true," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"Besides it is a Presbyterian church and we are
                                        Congregationalists."</p>
            <p>Jennie made no reply.</p>
            <p>"And I can't bear the idea of leaving the Broadway Tabernacle
                                        church. I was brought up in it. I have been in its
                                        Sunday-School ever since I can recollect. It was dear to me
                                        in its old homely attire as a Congregationalist
                                        meeting-house. It is dear to me in its new aristocratic
                                        attire as a Congregationalist cathedral. And Harry was
                                        baptized there. And there are all our dearest and best
                                        friends. It would be like pulling a tooth to uproot from
                                        it."</p>
            <p>"It is dear to me too, John," said Jennie softly, "for your sake,
                                        if not for my own."</p>
            <p>"And all our friends are there, Jennie," continued I. "Except the
                                        Lines and Deacon Goodsole we hardly know anybody here."</p>
            <p>"Though I suppose time will cure that," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"I do not know that I care to cure it," said I.</p>
            <p>Jennie made no response.</p>

            <p>Was it not at Bunker Hill that the soldiers were directed to
                                        reserve their fire till the attacking party had exhausted
                                        theirs? That is the way Jennie conducts an
                                        argument—when she argues at all, which is very
                                        seldom. She accepted every consideration I had offered
                                        against uniting with the Wheathedge church, and yet I knew
                                        her opinion was not changed; and somehow my own began to
                                        waver. I wonder how that method of arguing would work in the
                                        court-room. I mean to try it some time.</p>
            <p>I had exhausted my fire and Jennie was still silent. Silence they
                                        say means consent. But I knew that it did not in her case.
                                        It depends so much upon the kind of silence.</p>
            <p>"What do you say Jennie?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Well, John," said she slowly and thoughtfully, "perhaps there
                                        are two sides to the question. I don't like to leave the
                                        Broadway Tabernacle. But it seems to me that we have left
                                        it. We cannot attend its prayer-meetings, or go to its
                                        Sabbath-school, or worship with its members on the Sabbath,
                                        or even mingle much with its members in social life. We have
                                        left it, and we ought to have thought of that before we<pb n="36"/> left—not
                                        after. Perhaps I am to blame, John, that I did not think of
                                        it more. I did not think of what you were giving up for me
                                        when you took this beautiful home for my sake."</p>
            <p>I had not taken it for her sake—that is, not wholly for
                                        her sake. And as to the giving up! Why, bless you, that
                                        little sitting-room, with the wife and baby it contained,
                                        was worth a thousand Tabernacles to me; and I managed to
                                        tell Jennie so, and emphasize the declaration with
                                        a—well no matter. But she did not need the
                                        information, she knew it very well before, I am sure.</p>
            <p>"The real question seems to me, John, to be whether we mean to be
                                        church members at all?" said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"Church members at all!" I echoed.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said she. "We are not members of the Broadway Tabernacle
                                        any more—except in name. What is a foot or an arm
                                        fifty miles away from the body? Can they keep loving watch
                                        and care over us; or we over them? It is not a question
                                        between one church-home and another, John; it is a question
                                        between this church-home and none at all."</p>
            <pb n="37"/>
            <p>"But, Jennie," said I, "the finances here are in a fearful state.
                                        They are always coming down on the church for contributions,
                                        and holding fairs in summer, and tableaux and what not, in
                                        winter, and generally waiting for something to turn up. If I
                                        had the naming of this church I would call it St. Micawber's
                                        church."</p>
            <p>Jennie laughed. "Well, John," said she, "I think you are ready
                                        enough with your money." (I am not so sure of that. I am
                                        inclined to think that is Jennie's way of making me so.)
                                        "And I have nothing to say about the finances."</p>
            <p>"Besides, Jennie," said I—for I really had no faith in
                                        the financial argument—"this is a Presbyterian
                                        church and we are Congregationalists."</p>
            <p>"It is a church of Christ, John," said Jennie soberly, "and we, I
                                        hope, are Christians more than Congregationalists."</p>
            <p>That was the last that was said. But the next morning I carried
                                        down with me, to New York, a letter addressed to the clerk
                                        of the Broadway Tabernacle, asking for letters of dismission
                                        and recommendation to the Calvary Presbyterian church at
                                        Wheathedge. And so commenced our parish life.</p>

            <p>"JENNIE," said I, "I don't believe in Mr. Work's sermon this
                                        morning, do you?"</p>
            <p>"I don't think I do, John; but to be candid I did not hear a
                                        great deal of it."</p>
            <p>It was Sunday evening. Harry was asleep in his room. The baby,
                                        sung to her sweet slumbers pressed against her mother's
                                        heart, had been lain down at last in her little cradle.
                                        Jennie, her evening work finished, had come down into the
                                        library and was sitting on the lounge beside me.</p>
            <p>"I was not so fortunate," said I. "Blessed are those who having
                                        ears hear not—sometimes. I listened, and took the
                                        other side. My church was converted into a court-room, I
                                        into an advocate. If I believed Mr. Work's doctrine was
                                        sound Protestantism I should turn Roman Catholic. Its
                                        teaching is the warmer, cheerier, more helpful of the two."</p>
            <p>Then I took up the open book that lay on my library table and
                                        read from Father Hyacinthe's<pb n="39"/> discourses the following
                                        paragraph—from an address delivered on the first
                                        communion of a converted Protestant to the Roman Catholic
                                        Church:</p>
            <quote>
                                        <p>"Where (in Protestantism) is that real Presence which
                                                flows from the sacrament as from a hidden spring,
                                                like a river of peace, upon the true Catholic, all
                                                the day long, gladdening and fertilizing all his

                                                us—awaited you in our Church, and in that
                                                sacrament which so powerfully attracted you, even
                                                when you but half believed it. In your own worship,
                                                as in the ancient synagogue, you found naught but
                                                types and shadows; they spoke to you of reality, but
                                                did not contain it; they awakened your thirst, but
                                                did not quench it; weak and empty rudiments which
                                                have no longer the right to rest, since the veil of
                                                the temple has been rent asunder and eternal
                                                realities been revealed."</p>
                                </quote>
            <p>"Yes, Jennie," said I. "If I thought Father Hyacinthe were right,
                                        I should turn Roman Catholic. And Mr. Work this morning
                                        confirmed him. He took away the substance. He left us only a
                                        type, a shadow."</p>
            <p>The sermon was on the words—"Do this in remembrance of
                                        me." It was a doctrinal sermon. I am not sure that it might
                                        not have<pb n="40"/> been a useful
                                        one—in the sixteenth century. It was a sermon
                                        against Romanism and Lutheranism and High Church episcopacy.
                                        The minister told us what were the various doctrines of the
                                        communion. He analyzed them and dismissed them one after
                                        another. He showed very conclusively, to us Protestants,
                                        that the Romanists are wrong, to us Presbyterians that the
                                        Episcopalians are wrong, to us who are open Communionists
                                        that the close Communionists are wrong. As there does not
                                        happen to be either Romanist, Episcopalian, or close
                                        Communionist in our congregation, I cannot say how
                                        efficacious his arguments would have been if addressed to
                                        any one who was in previous doubt as to his conclusions.
                                        Then he proceeded to expound what he termed the rational and
                                        Scriptural doctrine of communion. It is, he told us, simply
                                        a memorial service. It simply commemorates the past. "As,"
                                        said he, "every year, the nation gathers to strew flowers
                                        upon the graves of its patriot soldiers, so this day the
                                        Christian Church gathers to strew with flowers of love and
                                        praise the grave of the Captain of our salvation. As in the
                                        one act all differences are<pb n="41"/> forgotten, and the nation is one in
                                        the sacred presence of death, so in the other, creeds and
                                        doctrines vanish, and the Church of Christ appears at the
                                        foot of Calvary as one in Christ Jesus."</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton asked me, as we came out of church, if the sermon was
                                        not a magnificent one. I evaded the question. I was obliged
                                        to confess to myself that it was unsatisfactory. If I were
                                        obliged to choose between the Protestantism of Mr. Work and
                                        the Romanism of Father Hyacinthe, I am afraid I should
                                        choose the latter.</p>
            <p>"But," said Jennie, "Mr. Work's sermon was not true Protestant
                                        doctrine, John. There is a Real Presence in the communion.
                                        Only it is in the heart, not in the head, in us, not in the
                                        symbols that we eat. Did you not feel the Real Presence when
                                        Father Hyatt in the afternoon broke and blessed the bread?
                                        Did you not see the living Christ in his radiant face and
                                        hear the living Christ in his touching words, and his more
                                        touching silence?"</p>
            <p>Yes! I did. Father Hyatt had disproved the morning's sermon,
                                        though he said never a word about it.</p>
            <pb n="42"/>
            <p>Father Hyatt is an old, old man. He has long since retired from
                                        active service, having worn out his best days here at
                                        Wheathedge, in years now long gone by. A little money left
                                        him by a parishioner, and a few annual gifts from old
                                        friends among his former people, are his means of support.
                                        His hair is white as snow. His hands are thin, his body
                                        bent, his voice weak, his eyesight dim, his ears but half
                                        fulfil their office; his mind even shows signs of the
                                        weakness and wanderings of old age; but his heart is young,
                                        and I verily believe he looks forward to the hour of his
                                        release with hopes as high and expectations as ardent as
                                        those with which, in college, he anticipated the hour of his
                                        graduation. This was the man, patriarch of the Church, who
                                        has lived to see the children he baptized grow up, go forth
                                        into the world, many die and be buried; who has baptized the
                                        second and even the third generation, and has seen
                                        Wheathedge grow from a cross-road to a flourishing village;
                                        who this afternoon, perhaps for the last time—I
                                        could not help thinking so as I sat in
                                        church—interpreted to us the love of Christ as it
                                        is uttered to our hearts in this most<pb n="43"/> sacred and hallowed of all services.
                                        Very simply, very gently, quite unconsciously, he refuted
                                        the cheerless doctrine of the morning sermon, and pointed us
                                        to the Protestant doctrine of the Real Presence. Do you ask
                                        me what he said? Nothing. It was by his silence that he
                                        spoke.</p>
            <p>A few tender, loving, reverential words as he broke the bread.
                                        Three minutes of silver speech, the rest of his part of the
                                        service a golden silence. But those few words were radiant
                                        with the presence and the love of a risen, a living Saviour.
                                        It was not of the Christ that died, but of the Christ that
                                        now lives, and intercedes, and guides, and preserves, and
                                        saves, he spoke, with voice feeble with old age, but strong
                                        with love. And as he spoke, it seemed to me, I think it
                                        seemed to all of us, that the Christ he loved so much and
                                        served so faithfully was close at hand, near and ready to
                                        bless us all, not with a sacred memory only, but with a Real
                                        Presence, the more real because unseen.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Jennie," said I after we had sat for a few minutes in
                                        silence recalling that sacred hour, "Yes, Jennie, there was
                                        a Real Presence<pb n="44"/> in Father
                                        Hyatt's breaking and blessing of the bread. But what do you
                                        say of the disquisition of Mr. Work on transubstantiation
                                        which followed it?"</p>
            <p>"I didn't hear it, John. Was it really about transubstantiation?
                                        Perhaps I ought to have listened—but I could not,
                                        I did not want to. A higher, holier voice was speaking to
                                        me. I was absorbed in that. I was thinking how of old time
                                        Christ appeared in the breaking of bread to the disciples
                                        whose eyes were holden. And to-night, John, as I have been
                                        rocking baby to sleep I have been reading Tennyson's Holy
                                        Grail, and thinking how often, in our modern life, Calabad
                                        and Percivale kneel at the same shrine, and how often what
                                        is but a memorial service to the one affords a beatific
                                        vision of a living and life-giving Lord to the other."</p>
            <p>And Jennie repeated in a low soft voice a verse from that strange
                                        poem, whose meaning, I sometimes think, is but half
                                        understood even by its admirers:</p>

            <p>"Ah! yes, John, Father Hyacinthe is mistaken, and Mr. Work is
                                        mistaken too. There is more in our communion than can be
                                        explained. The reason is a great deal, a great deal, but it
                                        is not everything. And there are experiences which it can
                                        neither understand nor interpret. Baby is not only
                                        up-stairs, John; he is in my heart of hearts. And you are
                                        never away from home, husband mine, though often in the
                                        city, but are always with me. And my Saviour he is not far
                                        away, he is not in the heaven that we must bring him down,
                                        nor in the past that we must summon him from centuries long
                                        gone by. He is in our hearts, John. Do I believe in the Real
                                        Presence? Do I not know that there is a Real Presence? And
                                        neither priest nor pastor can take it from me."</p>

                                        this afternoon, Jennie," said I, "instead of Mr. Work."</p>
            <p>"I wish some good friend of Mr. Work would advise him not to talk
                                        at the communion," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"Write him a note," said I.</p>
            <p>Jennie shook her head. "No," said she. "It would only do harm.
                                        But I wish ministers knew and felt that at the communion
                                        table there is a Real Presence that makes many words
                                        unfitting. When we are on the mount of Transfiguration, we
                                        do not care much for Peter, James or John. And so, dear, I
                                        recommend you to do as I do—if the minister must
                                        give us a doctrinal disquisition, or a learned argument, or
                                        an elaborate arabesque of fancy work, or an impassioned
                                        appeal, let him go his way and do not heed him. I want
                                        silence that I may commune with the Real Presence. If the
                                        minister does not give it me, I take it."</p>
            <p>Jennie is right, I am sure. What we laymen want at the communion
                                        service, from our pastors, is chiefly silence. Only a few
                                        and simple words; the fewer and simpler the better. Oh! you
                                        who are privileged to distribute to us the emblems<pb n="47"/> of Christ's love,
                                        believe me that the communion never reaches its highest end,
                                        save when you interpret it to us, not merely as a
                                        flower-strewn grave of a dead past, but as a Mount of
                                        Transfiguration whereon we talk with a living, an ascended
                                        Saviour. Believe me too, we want at that table no other
                                        message than that which a voice from on high whispers in our
                                        hearts: "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him!"</p>

            <p>I FOUND one evening last week, in coming home, a
                                        business-like-looking letter lying on my library table. I
                                        rarely receive letters at Wheathedge; nearly all my
                                        correspondence comes to my New York office. I tore it open
                                        in some surprise and read the note as follows:   </p>

            <p>"Well," said I to myself, "I wonder what this means. It can't be
                                        a male sewing society, I suppose. It can hardly be a
                                        prayer-meeting at Jim Wheaton's house. Male members! eh?<pb n="49"/> I thought the
                                        female members carried on this church." In my perplexity, I
                                        handed the note to my wife. She read it with care. "Well,"
                                        said she, "I am glad the people are waking up at last."
                                        "What does it mean?" said I. "It means money," said she. "Or
                                        rather it means the want of money. Mrs. Work told me last
                                        week she believed her husband would have to resign. All last
                                        quarter's salary is overdue, and something beside. It seems
                                        that Mr. Wheaton has begun to act, at last. I don't see what
                                        they want to make such men church officers for."</p>
            <p>My wife has not very clear ideas about the legal relations which
                                        exist between the Church and the Society. Mr. Wheaton is an
                                        officer, not of the church but of the society; but I did not
                                        think it worth while to correct the mistake.</p>
            <p>"I do want to think kindly of every body," said Jennie; "but it
                                        makes me indignant to see a minister defrauded of his dues."</p>
            <p>"Defrauded is a pretty strong word, Jennie," said I.</p>
            <p>"It is a true word," said she. "The people promise the minister
                                        $1200 a year, and then<pb n="50"/> pay him
                                        grudgingly $900, and don't finally make up the other $300
                                        till he threatens to resign; if that is not defrauding, I
                                        don't know what is. If Mr. Wheaton can't make the Board of
                                        Trustees keep their promises any better than that, he had
                                        better resign. I wish he would."</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton is not a member of the church; and, to tell the
                                        truth, his reputation for success is greater than his
                                        reputation for integrity. But he is president of the
                                        Koniwasset branch railroad, and a leading director of the
                                        Koniwasset coal mines, and a large operator in stocks, and
                                        lives in one of the finest houses in Wheathedge, and keeps
                                        the handsomest carriage, and hires the most expensive pew,
                                        and it was considered quite a card, I believe, to get him to
                                        take the presidency of the Board of Trustees.</p>
            <p>"Of course you'll go, John," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"I don't know about that, Jennie," said I. "I don't want to get
                                        mixed up with our church finances in their present
                                        condition."</p>
            <p>"I don't know how they are ever to get in a better condition,
                                        John," said she, "unless some men like you do get mixed up
                                        with them."</p>
            <p>Jennie, as usual, knew me better than I knew<pb n="51"/> myself. I went. I was
                                        delayed just as I was starting away, and so, contrary to my
                                        custom—for I rather pride myself on being a very
                                        punctual man—I was a little late. The male members
                                        of the Calvary Presbyterian Congregation were already
                                        assembled in Mr. James Wheaton's library when I arrived. I
                                        was a little surprised to see how few male members we had.
                                        To look round the congregation on Sunday morning, one would
                                        certainly suppose there were more. It even seems to me there
                                        were at least twice as many at the sewing society when it
                                        met at James Wheaton's last winter.</p>
            <p>I entered just as Mr. Wheaton was explaining the object of the
                                        meeting. "Gentlemen," said he, suavely, "the Calvary
                                        Presbyterian Church, like most of its neighbors, has rather
                                        hard work to get along, financially. Its income is not at
                                        all equal to its expenditures. The consequence is we
                                        generally stand on the debtor side of the ledger. As
                                        probably you know, there is a mortgage on the church of four
                                        thousand dollars. The semi-annual interest is due on the
                                        first of next month. There is, I think, no money in the
                                        treasury to meet it."</p>
            <pb n="52"/>
            <p>Here he looked at the treasurer as if for confirmation, and that
                                        gentleman, a bald-headed, weak-face man, smiled a mournful
                                        smile, and shook his head feebly.</p>
            <p>"The Board of Trustees," continued the President, "have directed
                                        me to call this meeting and lay the matter before you."</p>
            <p>There was a slight pause—a sort of expectant silence.
                                        "It isn't a large sum," gently insinuated the President, "if
                                        divided among us all. But, in some way, gentlemen, it must
                                        be raised. It won't do for us to be insolvent, you know. A
                                        church can't take the benefit of the bankrupt act, I
                                        believe, Mr. Laicus."</p>
            <p>Being thus appealed to, I responded with a question. Was this
                                        mortgage interest all that the church owed? No! the
                                        President thought not. He believed there was a small
                                        floating debt beside. "And to whom," said I, "Mr. Treasurer,
                                        is this floating debt due?" The Treasurer looked to the
                                        President for an answer, and the President accepted his
                                        pantomimic hint.</p>
            <p>"Most of it," said he, "I believe, to the minister. But I
                                        understand that he is in no<pb n="53"/> special hurry for his money. In
                                        fact," continued he, blandly, "a debt that is due to the
                                        minister need never be a very serious burden to a church.
                                        Nominally it is due to him, but really it is distributed
                                        around among the members of the church. Part is due to the
                                        grocer, part to the tailor, part to the butcher, part to the
                                        dressmaker, and part is borrowed from personal friends. I
                                        lent the parson twenty-five dollars myself last week. But
                                        mortgage interest is another matter. That, you know,
                                                <emph>must</emph> be provided for."</p>
            <p>"And pray," said I, for I happened to know the parson did need
                                        the money, "how much is the pastor's salary? And how much of
                                        it is overdue?"</p>
            <p>"Well," said the President, "I suppose his salary is
                                        about—two thousand dollars. Yes," continued he,
                                        thoughtfully, somewhat affectionately playing with his gold
                                        watch-chain, "it must net him fully that amount."</p>
            <p>I was wondering what this "<emph>about</emph>" meant, and whether
                                        the minister did not have a fixed salary, when Deacon
                                        Goodsole broke in abruptly with, "It's twelve hundred
                                        dollars a year!"</p>
            <pb n="54"/>
            <p>"Yes," responded the President, "it is nominally fixed by the
                                        Board at twelve hundred dollars. But then, gentlemen, the
                                        perquisites are something. In the course of a year they net
                                        up to a pretty large amount. Last winter, the ladies clubbed
                                        together and made the parson a present of carpets for his
                                        parlors; the year before we gave him a donation party;
                                        almost every year, Deacon Goodsole sends him a barrel of
                                        flour from his store; in one way or another he gets a good
                                        many similar little presents. I always send him a free pass
                                        over the road. And then there are the wedding fees which
                                        must amount to a handsome item in the course of the year. It
                                        can't be less than two thousand or twenty-five hundred
                                        dollars all told. A very snug little income, gentlemen."</p>
            <p>"Double what I get," murmured Mr. Hardcap. A very exemplary
                                        gentleman is Mr. Hardcap, the carpenter, but more known for
                                        the virtue of economy than for any other. He lives in three
                                        rooms over his carpenter shop down in Willow lane. If our
                                        pastor lived there he would be dismissed very soon.</p>
            <p>I wondered, as the President was speaking,<pb n="55"/> whether he included the profit
                                                <emph>he</emph> made in selling Koniwasset coal to
                                        the Newtown railroad among <emph>his</emph>
                                        perquisitis, and as part of
                                                <emph>his</emph> salary. But I did not ask.</p>
            <p>"Week before last," said Deacon Goodsole, "the parson was called
                                        to attend a wedding at Compton Mills. He drove down Monday,
                                        through that furious storm, was gone nearly all day, paid
                                        six dollars for his horse and buggy, and received five
                                        dollars wedding fee. I wonder how long it would take at that
                                        rate to bring his salary up to twenty-five hundred dollars."</p>
            <p>There was a general laugh at the parson's mercantile venture, but
                                        no other response.</p>
            <p>"Well, gentlemen," said the President, a little gruffly, I
                                        fancied, "let us get back to business. How shall we raise
                                        this mortgage interest? I will be one of ten to pay it off."</p>
            <p>"Excuse me," said I, gently, "but before we begin to pay our
                                        debts, we must find out how much they are. Can the Treasurer
                                        tell us how much we owe Mr. Work?"</p>
            <p>The Treasurer looked inquiringly at the President, but getting no
                                        response, found his voice, and replied, "Three hundred
                                        dollars."</p>
            <pb n="56"/>
            <p>"The whole of last quarter?" said I.</p>
            <p>The Treasurer nodded.</p>
            <p>"I think there is a little due on last year," said Deacon
                                        Goodsole.</p>
            <p>"A hundred and seventy-five dollars," said the Treasurer.</p>
            <p>"The fact is, gentlemen," said the President, resuming his
                                        blandest manner, "you know the Methodists have just got into
                                        their new stone church. The trustees thought it necessary
                                        not to be behind their neighbors, and so we have completely
                                        upholstered our church anew, at a cost of five hundred
                                        dollars." ("And made the parson pay the bill," said Deacon
                                        Goodsole, soto voce.) "We
                                        should have frescoed it, too, if we had had the money."
                                        ("Why didn't you take his wedding fees?" said the Deacon,
                                                soto voce.)</p>
            <p>"Well, for my part," said I, "I am willing to do my share toward
                                        paying off this debt. But I will not pay a cent unless the
                                        whole is paid. The minister must be provided for."</p>
            <p>"I say so, too," murmured Mr. Hardcap. I was surprised at this
                                        sudden and unexpected reinforcement. The Deacon told me
                                                afterwards,<pb n="57"/>
                                        that Mr. Hardcap had been repairing the parson's roof and
                                        had not got his pay.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps," continued I, "we can fund this floating debt, make the
                                        mortgage four thousand five hundred, raise the difference
                                        among ourselves, and so clear it all up. Who holds the
                                        mortgage?"</p>
            <p>This question produced a sensation like that of opening the
                                        seventh seal in heaven. There was silence for the space
                                        of—well, something less than half an hour. The
                                        Treasurer looked at the President. The President looked at
                                        the Treasurer. The male members of the congregation looked
                                        at each other. The Deacon looked at me with a very
                                        significant laugh lurking in the corners of his mouth. At
                                        length the President spoke.</p>
            <p>"Well, gentlemen," said he, "I suppose most of you know I hold
                                        this mortgage. I have not called you together because I want
                                        to press the church for the money. But a debt, gentlemen, is
                                        a debt, and the church, above all institutions, ought to
                                        remember the divine injunction of our blessed Master (the
                                        President is not very familiar with Scripture, and may be
                                        excused the blunder):<pb n="58"/> 'Owe no
                                        man anything.' ("Except the minister," said Deacon Goodsole,
                                                soto voce.) The
                                        proposition of our friend here, however, looks like business
                                        to me. I think the matter can be arranged in that way."</p>
            <p>Arranged it was. The President got his additional security, and
                                        the parson got his salary, which was the main thing Jennie
                                        cared for. And to be perfectly frank with the reader, I
                                        should not have gone near Jim Wheaton's that night if it had
                                        not been that I knew it would please Jennie. I wait with
                                        some curiosity to see what will become of a church whose
                                        expenditures are regularly a quarter more than its income.
                                        Meanwhile, I wonder whether the personal presents which
                                        friends make for affection's sake to their pastor ought to
                                        be included by the Board of Trustees in their estimate of
                                        his salary? and also whether it is quite the thing to expect
                                        that the pastor will advance, out of his own pocket,
                                        whatever money is necessary to keep his church from falling
                                        behind its neighbors in showy attractions?</p>

            <head type="sub">Am I a Drone?</head>
            <p>DEACON Goodsole wants me to take a class in the Sabbath-school.
                                        So does Mr. Work. So I think does Jennie, though she does
                                        not say much. She only says that if I did she thinks I could
                                        do a great deal of good. I wonder if I could. I have stoutly
                                        resisted them so far. But I confess last Sunday's sermon has
                                        shaken me a little.</p>
            <p>I was kept in the city Saturday night by a legal appointment, and
                                        went the next day to hear my old friend Thomas Lane preach.
                                        His text was "Why stand ye here all the day idle?"</p>
            <p>He depicted very graphically the condition of the poor in New
                                        York. He is a man of warm sympathies, of a large and
                                        generous heart. He mingles a great deal with the poor of his
                                        own congregation. To his credit and that of his wife be it
                                        said, there are a good many poor in his congregation. But he
                                        does not confine his sympathies to his own people. He told
                                        us of<pb n="60"/> that immense class who
                                        live in New York without a church-home, of the heathen that
                                        are growing up among us.</p>
            <p>"You need not go to Africa," said he, "to find them. They come to
                                        your door every morning for cold victuals. God will hold you
                                        responsible for their souls. Are you in the Sabbath-school?
                                        Are you in the Mission-school? Are you in the neighborhood
                                        prayer-meeting? Are you a visitor? Are you distributing
                                        tracts? Are you doing anything to seek and to save that
                                        which is lost?" Then he went on to say what should be done;
                                        and to maintain the right and duty of laymen to preach, to
                                        teach, to visit, to do all things which belong to "fishers
                                        of men." "There are a great many church members," said he,
                                        "who seem to suppose that their whole duty consists in
                                        paying pew rent and listening to preaching. That is not
                                        Christianity. If you are doing nothing you are drones. There
                                        is no room in the hive for you. The Church has too many idle
                                        Christians already. We don't want you."</p>
            <p>He did not argue. He simply asserted. But he evidently felt the
                                        truth of all that he said. I<pb n="61"/> believe I should have decided at
                                        once to go into the Sabbath-school as soon as I came home,
                                        but for a little incident.</p>
            <p>After church I walked home with Mr. Lane to dine with him. Mr.
                                        Sower joined and walked along with us. He is at the head of
                                        a large manufacturing establishment. He is one of Mr. Lane's
                                        warmest friends. Mr. Lane believes him to be a devoted
                                        Christian. "Well, parson," said he, "I suppose after
                                        to-night's sermon there is nothing left for me to do but to
                                        take a letter from the Church—if you don't
                                        excommunicate me before I get it."</p>
            <p>"What's the matter now?" said the parson.</p>
            <p>"I am neither visiting," said Mr. Sower, "nor distributing
                                        tracts, nor attending a tenement-house prayer-meeting, nor
                                        preaching, nor working in a mission, nor doing anything in
                                        the Church, but going to its service and paying my pew rent,
                                        and sometimes a little something over to make up a
                                        deficiency. The fact is every day in the week I have my
                                        breakfast an hour before you do, and am off to the factory.
                                        I never get home till six o'clock, sometimes not then. My
                                        day's work uses up my day's energies. I can't<pb n="62"/> go out to a
                                        tenement-house prayer-meeting, or to tract distribution in
                                        the evening. I can hardly keep awake in our own church
                                        prayer-meeting. If it were not for Sunday's rest my work
                                        would kill me in a year. I sometimes think that perhaps I am
                                        devoting too much of my time to money-making. But what shall
                                        I do? There are four hundred workmen in the factory. Most of
                                        them have families. All of those families are really
                                        dependent on me for their daily bread. It takes all my
                                        life's energies to keep them employed. Shall I leave that
                                        work to take hold of tenement-house visitation and tract
                                        distribution?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Lane replied promptly that Mr. Sower was to do no such thing.
                                        "Your factory," said he, "is your field. That is the work
                                        God has given you to do. It is your parish. Do not leave it
                                        for another—only do not forget that you have to
                                        give an account of your parochial charge. You are to study,
                                        not how to get the most money out of your four hundred
                                        workmen, but how to do them the most good. That is Christian
                                        duty for you. But your case is very peculiar. There is not
                                        one man in a thousand situated as you are."</p>
            <pb n="63"/>
            <p>Then I began to think that perhaps my law office was my field. It
                                        gives me enough to do I am sure. We are not all drones who
                                        are not working for the Church. There is a work for Christ
                                        outside. And I do not want to take a Sabbath-school class. I
                                        want Sunday mornings to myself. Every other morning I have
                                        to be an early riser. I do enjoy being lazy Sunday morning.</p>
            <p>But then there is that class of young men from the mill. Deacon
                                        Goodsole says they don't know anything. He has no one who
                                        can manage them. And Mr. Work thinks it's a dreadful sin, I
                                        do not doubt, that I do not take it at once. I do not care
                                        much for that. But Jennie says I am just the one to manage
                                        these boys if I feel like undertaking it. And I would like
                                        to prove her good opinion of me true.</p>
            <p>I was just in that perplexity when night before last a meeting on
                                        behalf of the City Mission Society was held here. Mr.
                                        Mingins, the Superintendent of city missions, was one of the
                                        speakers.</p>
            <p>He made an earnest and at times a really eloquent speech. He
                                        would have made a splendid jury lawyer. He depicted in the
                                        most lively<pb n="64"/> colors
                                        the wretched condition of the outcast population of New
                                        York. With all the eloquence of a warm heart, made more
                                        attractive by his broad Scotch, he pled with us to take an
                                        active part in their amelioration. "Pure religion and
                                        undefiled, before God and the Father, is this," cried he,
                                        "to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and
                                        to keep himself unspotted from the world."</p>
            <p>I resolved to take up that class of Mission boys straightways.
                                        But as I came out I met Hattie Bridgeman. She is an old
                                        friend of Jennie's and has had a hard, hard life. Her
                                        husband is an invalid. Her children are thrown on her for
                                        support. As I met her at the door she pressed my hand
                                        without speaking. I could see by the trembling lip and the
                                        tearful eye, that her heart was full. "I wish I had not come
                                        to-night," she said, as we walked along together. "Such
                                        stories make my heart bleed. It seems as though I ought to
                                        go right out to visit the sick, comfort the afflicted, care
                                        for the neglected. But what can I do? My children are
                                        dependent on me. These six weeks at Wheathedge are my only
                                        vacation. The rest of the time I am teaching<pb n="65"/> music from Monday
                                        morning till Saturday night. Sunday, when I ought to rest,
                                        is my most exhausting day. For then I sing in church. If I
                                        were to leave my scholars my children would starve. How can
                                                <emph>I</emph> do anything for my Savior?"</p>
            <p>It was very plain that she was to serve her Savior in the music
                                        lesson as indeed she does. For she goes into every house as
                                        a missionary. She carries the spirit of Christ in her heart.
                                        His joy is radiant in her face. She preaches the Gospel in
                                        houses where neighborhood prayer-meetings cannot be held, in
                                        households which tract-distributors never enter. The street
                                        that needs Gospel visitation most is Fifth avenue. That is
                                        in her district. And, nobly, though unconsciously, she
                                        fulfils her mission. More than one person I have heard say,
                                        "If to be a Christian is to be like Mrs. Bridgeman, I wish I
                                        were one." Our pastor preaches no such effective sermons as
                                        does she by her gentleness, her geniality, her patience, her
                                        long suffering with joyfulness. And when the Sabbath comes,
                                        her voice, though it leads the service of song in a
                                        fashionable city church, expresses the ardor of her
                                        Christian heart, and is fraught<pb n="66"/>
                                        with quite as true devotion as the prayers of her pastor.</p>
            <p>Something like this Jennie told her as we walked along from
                                        church; and she left us comforted. And I was a little
                                        comforted too. It is very clear, is it not, that we are not
                                        all drones who are not at work in the church. There are
                                        other fields than the Sabbath-school.</p>
            <p>Do I carry Christ into my law office, and into the court-room, as
                                        Mrs. Bridgeman does into the parlor and the chair? That is
                                        the first point to be settled. The other comes up afterward.
                                        But it does persist in coming up. It is not settled yet.
                                        Will it hurt my Sunday to take that class for an hour? I
                                        doubt it.</p>
            <p>I must talk it over with Jennie and see what she really thinks
                                        about it.</p>

            <p>LAST evening before I had found an opportunity to talk it over
                                        with Jennie, Dr. Argure and Deacon Goodsole called. I
                                        suspect the deacon's conscience had been quickened even more
                                        than mine respecting my duty to that mission class by Mr.
                                        Minging's address. For I have noticed that our consciences
                                        are apt to be quickened by sermons and addresses more
                                        respecting our neighbors' duties even than respecting our
                                        own.</p>
            <p>Dr. Argure had come down the day before from <name>Newtown</name>
                                        to attend the city mission meeting. He is a very learned
                                        man. At least I suppose he is, for everybody says so. He is
                                        at all events a very sonorous man. He has a large vocabulary
                                        of large words, and there are a great many people who cannot
                                        distinguish between great words and great thoughts. I do not
                                        mean to impugn his intellectual capital when I say that he
                                        does a very large credit business. In sailing on lake
                                        Superior you can sometimes see the<pb n="68"/> rocky bottom 30 or 40
                                        feet below the surface—the water is so clear. You
                                        never can see the bottom of Dr. Argure's sermons. Perhaps it
                                        is because they are so deep; I sometimes think it is because
                                        they are so muddy. Still he really is an able man, and knows
                                        the books, and knows how to turn his knowledge to a good
                                        account. Last summer he preached a sermon at Wheathedge, on
                                        female education. He told us about female education among
                                        the Greeks, and the Romans, and the Hebrews, and the
                                        Persians, and the Egyptians—though not much about
                                        it in America of to-day. But it was a learned
                                        discourse—at least I suppose so. Three weeks
                                        after, I met the President of the Board of Trustees of the
                                        Polltown Female Seminary, I mentioned incidentally that I
                                        was spending the summer at Wheathedge.</p>
            <p>"You have got a strong man up there somewhere," said he, "that
                                        Dr. Argure, of Newtown. He delivered an address before our
                                        seminary last week on female education; full of learning
                                        sir, full of learning. We put him right on our Board of
                                        Trustees. Next year I think we shall make him President."</p>
            <pb n="69"/>
            <p>A month or so after I found in the weekly <title>Watch
                                        Tower</title> an editorial,—indeed I think there
                                        were three in successive numbers—on female
                                        education. They had a familiar sound, and happening to meet
                                        the editor, I spoke of them.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said he "they are by Dr. Argure. A very learned man that
                                        sir. Does an immense amount of work too. He is one of our
                                        editorial contributors as perhaps you see, and an able man,
                                        very learned sir. Those are very original and able articles
                                        sir."</p>
            <p>This fall I took up the Adriatic Magazine, and there what should
                                        my eye fall on but an article on female education. I did not
                                        read it; but the papers assured their readers that it was a
                                        learned and exhaustive discussion on the whole subject by
                                        that scholarly and erudite writer, Dr. Argure. And having
                                        heard this asserted so often, I began to think that it
                                        certainly must be true. And then in January I received a
                                        pamphlet on female education by Dr. Argure. It was addressed
                                        to the Board of Education, and demanded a higher course of
                                        training for woman, and was a learned and <orig>exhaus-</orig>
               <pb n="70"/> tive discussion of the
                                        whole subject from the days of Moses down.</p>
            <p>"An able man that Dr. Argure," said Mr. Wheaton to me the other
                                        day referring to that same pamphlet.</p>
            <p>"Yes, I think he is," I could not help saying. "I think he can
                                        stir more puddings with one pudding stick than any other man
                                        I know."</p>
            <p>Still he stirs them pretty well. And if he can do it I do not
                                        know that there is any objection.</p>
            <p>But if I do not believe in Dr. Argure quite as fully as some less
                                        sceptical members of his congregation do, Deacon Goodsole
                                        believes in him most implicitly. Deacon Goodsole is a
                                        believer—not I mean in anything in particular, but
                                        generally. He likes to believe; he enjoys it; he does it,
                                        not on evidence, but on general principles. The deacons of
                                        the stories are all crabbed, gnarled, and cross-grained.
                                        They are the terrors of the little boys, and the thorn in
                                        the flesh to the minister. But Deacon Goodsole is the most
                                        cheery, bright, and genial of men. He is like a streak of
                                        sunshine. He sensibly radiates the prayer-meeting, which
                                        would be rather cold except for him. The little boys
                                                always<pb n="71"/> greet
                                        him with a "How do you do Deacon," and always get a smile,
                                        and a nod, and sometimes a stick of candy or a little book
                                        in return. His over-coat pockets are always full of some
                                        little books or tracts, and always of the bright and cheery
                                        description. Always full, I said; <emph>but</emph> that is a
                                        mistake; when he gets home at night they are generally
                                        empty. For he goes out literally as a sower went out to sow,
                                        I do not believe there is a child within five miles of
                                        Wheathedge that has not had one of the Deacon's little
                                        books.</p>
            <p>I suspected that the Deacon had come partly to talk with me about
                                        that Bible class, and I resolved to give him an opportunity.
                                        So I opened the way at once.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Laicus.</speaker>
               <p>—Well Deacon, how are church affairs coining
                                                on; pretty smoothly; salary paid up at last?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Deacon Goodsole.</speaker>

                                                it too. I don't think the parson would have got his
                                                money but for you.</p>

               <speaker>Laicus.</speaker>
               <p>—Not at all, Deacon. Thank my wife, not me. She
                                                was righteously indignant at the church for leaving
                                                its minister unpaid so<pb n="72"/> long. If I were the parson I
                                                would clear out that Board of Trustees and put in a
                                                new one, made up wholly of women.</p>

               <p>—Mr. Laicus, have you considered the Scriptural
                                                teachings concerning the true relations and sphere
                                                of women in the church of Christ. The apostle says
                                                very distinctly that he does not suffer a woman to
                                                teach or to usurp authority over the man, and it is
                                                very clear that to permit the female members of the
                                                church to occupy such offices as those you have
                                                indicated would be to suffer her to usurp that
                                                authority which the Scripture reposes alone in the
                                                head—that is in man.</p>

               <speaker>Dr. Argure.</speaker>
               <p>—Most certainly it does, sir. The apostle is
                                                very explicit on that point, very explicit. And I
                                                hold, sir, that for women to preach, or to speak in
                                                public, or in the prayer-meeting of the church, is a

                                                not to be found in the Sabbath School; they cannot

               <p>—Mr. Laicus here needs a little touching up on
                                                that point, Doctor; and I am glad you are here to do
                                                it. How as to that Bible class, Mr. Laicus, that I
                                                spoke to you about<pb n="74"/> week before last? There are
                                                four or five young men from the barrow factory in
                                                the Sabbath School now. But they have no teacher. I
                                                am sure if you could see your way clear to take that
                                                class you would very soon have as many more. There
                                                are some thirty of them that rarely or never come to
                                                church. And as for me, I can't get at them. They are
                                                mostly unbelievers. Mr. Gear himself, the
                                                superintendent, is a regular out and out infidel.
                                                And I never could do anything with unbelievers.</p>

               <p>—It is unfortunately too common an excuse even
                                                with professors of religion that they are too busy
                                                to serve in the work of the Lord. There is for
                                                example the instance of Dr. Curall. He was elected
                                                at my suggestion last summer as an elder in our
                                                church. But he declined the office, which the
                                                apostle declares to be honorable, and of such a
                                                character that if it be well used they who employ it
                                                purchase to themselves a good degree. Alas! that it
                                                should be so frequently so—ourselves first
                                                and Christ afterwards.</p>

                                                refuses to leave the duties of his profession which
                                                he is doing well, to take on those of a church
                                                office which he might do but poorly? May not he who
                                                goes about healing the sick be following Christ as
                                                truly as he who preaches the Gospel to the poor? Is
                                                the one to be accused of serving the world any more
                                                because of his fees than the other because of his
                                                salary? Can an elder do any more to carry the Gospel

                                                could name, who are doing nothing in the church
                                                except pay their pew rent.</p>

               <p>—Suppose you pass my case for the moment, and
                                                take the others. Take farmer Faragon for example. He
                                                has a farm of three hundred acres. It keeps him busy
                                                all the week. He works hard, out of doors, all day.
                                                When evening comes he gets his newspaper, sits down
                                                by the fire and pretends to read. But I have noticed
                                                that he rarely reads ten minutes before he drops
                                                asleep. When he comes to church the same phenomenon
                                                occurs. He cannot resist the soporific tendencies of
                                                the furnaces. By the time Mr. Work gets fairly into
                                                secondly, Farmer Faragon is sound asleep. So<pb n="77"/> he does
                                                not even listen to the preaching. Is he then a
                                                drone? Suppose you make a calculation how many
                                                mouths he feeds indirectly by the products of his
                                                farm. I cannot even guess. But I know nothing ever
                                                goes from it that is not good. The child is happy
                                                that drinks his milk, the butcher fortunate who buys
                                                his beef, the housewife well off who has his apples
                                                and potatoes in her cellar. He never sends a
                                                doubtful article to market; never a short weight or
                                                a poor measure. I think that almost every one who
                                                deals with him recognizes in him a Christian man. He
                                                does not work in Sunday School, it is true, but he
                                                has brought more than one farm hand into it. Christ
                                                fed five thousand by the sea of Galilee with five
                                                loaves and two small fishes. Was that Christian?
                                                Farmer Faragon, feeds, in his small way, by his
                                                industry, a few scores of hungry mortals. Is he a
                                                drone?</p>
               <p>Or take Mr. Typsel the printer. He publishes the
                                                  <title>Newtown Chronicle</title>. He sends a
                                                weekly message to 10,000 readers, at least twenty
                                                times as many as Dr. Argure's congregation. I do not
                                                know how good a Christian he is; I do not know much

                                                minister in his. He has no right to neglect the

                                                conversion of the world. When the kingdoms of this
                                                world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
                                                Christ, then the church will have universal
                                                dominion. Here in Wheathedge, for example, Mr. Work
                                                is laboring to build up and strengthen the church of
                                                Christ. And you tell his people and the people of
                                                hundreds of similar parishes all over the land, that
                                                it is no matter whether they do any work in the
                                                church or not. Consider the effect of it.</p>

               <p>—It seems to me, Dr., that you entertain a low,
                                                though a very common, conception of your office. The
                                                ministers are not mere builders of churches. They
                                                are set to build <emph>men</emph>. The church which
                                                will have universal dominion is not this or that
                                                particular organization, but the whole body of those
                                                who love the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
                                                Churches, creeds, covenants, synods, assemblies,
                                                associations, will all fade; the soul alone is
                                                immortal. If you are really building for eternity
                                                you cannot merely build churches.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. Argure.</speaker>
               <p>—Consider then, Mr. Laicus, the<pb n="80"/> effect of your
                                                doctrine on the hearts and souls of men. Consider
                                                how many idle and indifferent professors of religion
                                                there are, who are doing nothing in the church, and
                                                nothing for the church. And you tell them that it is
                                                just as well they should not; that they are just as
                                                worthy of honor as if they were active in the Lords
                                                vineyard?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Laicus.</speaker>
               <p>—It is just as well if they are really serving
                                                Christ. It does not make any difference whether they
                                                are doing it in the church or out of the church.
                                                Christ himself served chiefly out of the church, and
                                                had it arrayed against him. So did Paul; so did
                                                Luther.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Deacon Goodsole.</speaker>
               <p>—Do you mean that it makes no difference, Mr.
                                                Laicus, whether a man is a member of the church or
                                                not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Laicus.</speaker>
               <p>—Not at all. That is quite another matter. I am
                                                speaking of church work, not of church membership;
                                                and I insist that church work and Christian work are
                                                not necessarily synonymous. I insist that whatever
                                                tends to make mankind better, nobler, wiser,
                                                permanently happier, if it is work carried on in the
                                                spirit of Christ is work for Christ, whether it is
                                                done in<pb n="81"/> the
                                                church or out of the church. I insist that every
                                                layman is bound to do ten-fold more for Christ out
                                                of the church than in its appointed ways and under
                                                its supervision. I have read, Dr., with a great deal
                                                of interest your learned and exhaustive treatise on
                                                the higher education of women, (I am afraid I told a
                                                little lie there; but had not the Dr. just told me
                                                that the truth was not to be told at all times), but
                                                I declare to you, that so far as the elevation of
                                                woman is concerned, I would rather have invented the
                                                sewing machine than have been the author of all the
                                                sermons, addresses, magazine articles, editorials
                                                and pamphlets on the woman question that have been
                                                composed since Paul wrote his second Epistle to the
                                                Christians.</p>

                                                dangerous doctrine. You do not consider its effect
                                                on the minds of the common people.</p>

               <p>—Do you consider the influence of the opposite
                                                teaching, both on the church and on the individual?
                                                We are building churches, you tell us. The
                                                "outsiders," as we call them,<pb n="82"/> very soon
                                                understand that. They see that we are on the
                                                look-out for men who can build us up, not for men
                                                whom we can build up. If a wealthy man comes into
                                                the neighborhood, we angle for him. If a devout,
                                                active, praying Christian moves into the
                                                neighborhood, we angle for him. If a drunken loafer
                                                drops down upon us, does anybody ever angle for him?
                                                If a poor, forlorn widow, who has to work from
                                                Monday morning till Saturday night, comes to dwell
                                                under the shadow of our church, do we angle for her?
                                                Yes! I am glad to believe we do. But the shrewdness,
                                                the energy, the tact, is displayed in the other kind
                                                of fishing. Don't you suppose "the world" understand
                                                this? Don't you suppose our Mr. Wheaton understands
                                                what we want him in the board of trustees for? Such
                                                men interpret our invitation—and they are
                                                not very wrong—as, come with us and do us
                                                good; not, come with us and we will do you good.</p>
               <p>Consider, too, its effect on the individual. I attended a
                                                morning prayer meeting last winter in the city. A
                                                young man told his experience. He started in the
                                                morning, he said, to go to the store. But it seemed
                                                as though the Lord bid<pb n="83"/> him retrace his steps. A
                                                voice within seemed to say to him, "Your duty is at
                                                the prayer meeting." The battle between Christ and
                                                the world was long and bitter. Christ at length
                                                prevailed. He had come to the prayer meeting. He
                                                wanted to tell the brethren what Christ had done for
                                                his soul. The experience may have been genuine. It
                                                may have been his duty to leave the store for the
                                                church that particular morning. But what is the
                                                effect of a training which teaches a young man to
                                                consider all the time he gives to the store as time
                                                appropriated to the world? It is that he can serve
                                                both God and mammon; that he actually does. It draws
                                                a sharp line between the sacred and secular. And
                                                most of his life is necessarily the secular.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I forgot to mention that Mrs. Goodsole had come over with her
                                        husband. She and Jennie sat side by side. But she had not
                                        opened her mouth since the salutations of the evening had
                                        been interchanged. She is the meekest and mildest of women.
                                        She is also the most timed. In
                                        public she rarely speaks. But it is currently reported that
                                        she avenges herself for her silence by the curtain lectures,
                                        she delivers to her good<pb n="84"/>
                                        husband at home. Of that, however, I cannot be sure. I speak
                                        only of rumor. Now she took advantage of a pause to say:</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Goodsole.</speaker>
               <p>—I like Mr. Laicus's doctrine. It's very
                                                comforting to a woman like me who am so busy at home
                                                that I can hardly get out to church on Sundays.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Deacon Goodsole.</speaker>
               <p>—I don't believe it's true. Yes I do too. But I
                                                don't believe it's applicable. That
                                                is—well what I mean to say—I
                                                can't express myself exactly, but my idea is this,
                                                that the people that won't work in the church are
                                                the very ones that do nothing out of it. The busy
                                                ones are busy everywhere. There is Mr. Line, for
                                                example. He has a large farm. He keeps a summer
                                                hotel, two houses always full; and they are

                                                keep any man busy. The whole burden of both hotel

               <p>—There is something in that. There is Mrs.

               <p>—On the other hand there is not a busier person
                                                in the church than Miss Moore. She supports herself
                                                and her widowed mother by teaching. She is in school
                                                from nine till three, and gives private lessons
                                                three evenings in the week, and yet she finds time
                                                to visit all the sick in the neighborhood. And when
                                                last year we held a fair to raise money for an organ
                                                for the Sabbath school, she was the most active and
                                                indefatigable worker among them all. Mrs. Bisket was
                                                the only one who compared with her.<pb n="86"/> And Mrs.
                                                Bisket keeps a summer boarding-house, and it was the
                                                height of the season, and she only had one girl part
                                                of the time.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Dr. Argure rose to go, Deacon Goodsole followed his example.
                                        There were a few minutes of miscellaneous conversation as
                                        the gentlemen put on their coats. As we followed them to the
                                        library door Deacon Goodsole turned to me:—</p>
            <p>"But you have not given me your answer yet, Mr. Laicus," said he.</p>
            <p>Before I could give it, Jennie had drawn her arm through mine,
                                        and looking up into my face for assent had answered for me.
                                        "He will think of it, Mr. Goodsole," said she. "He never
                                        decides any question of importance without sleeping on it."</p>
            <p>I have been thinking of it. I am sure that I am right in my
                                        belief that there are many ways of working for Christ beside
                                        working for the church. I am sure the first thing is for us
                                        to work for Christ in our daily, secular affairs. I am sure
                                        that all are not drones who are not buzzing in the
                                        ecclesiastical hive. But I am not so sure that I have not
                                        time to take that Bible-class. I am not so sure that the
                                        busy ones in<pb n="87"/> the
                                        church are not also the busy ones out of the church. I
                                        remember that when Mr. James Harper was hard at work
                                        establishing the business of Harper &amp; Brothers,
                                        which has grown to such immense proportions since, at the
                                        very time he was working night as well as day to expedite
                                        publications, he was a trustee and class-leader in John
                                        Street Methodist Church, and rarely missed the sessions of
                                        the board or the meetings of the class. I remember that Mr.
                                        Hatch, the famous banker, was almost the founder of the
                                        Jersey City Tabernacle Church, and his now
                                        President of the Howard Mission. Yet I suppose there is not
                                        a busier man in Wall street. I remember that Wm. E. Dodge,
                                        jr., and Morris K. Jessup, than whom there are few men more
                                        industrious, commercially, are yet both active in City
                                        Missions and in the Young Men's Christian Association; the
                                        former is an elder in an up-town church, and very active in
                                        Sabbath School work. I remember Ralph Wells, bishop of all
                                        the Presbyterian Sabbath Schools for miles around New York,
                                        who was, until lately, active in daily business in the city.
                                        Yes I am sure that hard<pb n="88"/>
                                        work in the week is not always a good reason for refusing to
                                        work in the church on the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>"Jennie, I am going to try that Bible class, as an experiment,
                                        for the winter."</p>

            <head type="sub">Mr. Gear.</head>
            <p>"JENNIE," said I, "Harry and I are going out for our walk."</p>
            <p>It was Sunday afternoon. I had enjoyed my usual Sunday afternoon
                                        nap, and now I was going out for my usual Sunday afternoon
                                        walk. Only this afternoon I had a purpose beside that of an
                                        hour's exercise in the fresh air.</p>
            <p>"I wish I could go with you John," said Jennie, "but it's Fanny's
                                        afternoon out, and I can't leave the baby. Where are you
                                        going?"</p>
            <p>"Up to the mill village, to see Mr. Gear," said I. "I am going to
                                        ask him to join the Bible class."</p>
            <p>"Why John he's an infidel I thought."</p>
            <p>"So they say," I replied. "But it can't do an infidel any harm to
                                        study the Bible. I may not succeed; I probably shan't; but I
                                        certainly shan't if I don't try."</p>
            <p>"I wish I could do something to help you<pb n="90"/> John. And I think I
                                        can. I can pray for you. Perhaps that will help you?"</p>
            <p>Help me. With the assurance of those prayers I walked along the
                                        road with a new confidence of hope. Before I had dreaded my
                                        errand, now I was in haste for the interview. I believe in
                                        the intercession of the saints; and Jennie is
                                        a—but I forget. The public are rarely interested
                                        in a man's opinion about his own wife.</p>
            <p>The mill village, as we call it, is a little collection of
                                        cottages with one or two houses of a somewhat more
                                        pretentious character, which gather round the wheel-barrow
                                        factory down the river, a good mile's walk from the church.
                                        It was a bright afternoon in October. The woods were in the
                                        glory of their radiant death, the air was crisp and keen.
                                        Harry who now ran before, now loitered behind, and now
                                        walked sedately by my side, was full of spirits, and there
                                        was everything to make the soul feel hope and courage. And
                                        yet I had my misgivings. When I had told Deacon Goodsole
                                        that I was going to call on Mr. Gear he exclaimed at my
                                        proposition.</p>
            <pb n="91"/>
            <p>"Why he's a regular out and outer. He does not believe in
                                        anything—Church, Bible, Sunday, Christ, God or
                                        even his own immortality."</p>
            <p>"What do you know of him?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"He was born in New England," replied the Deacon, "brought up in
                                        an orthodox family, taught to say the Westminster Assembly's
                                        Catechism (he can say it better than I can today), and
                                        listened twice every Sunday till he was eighteen to good
                                        sound orthodox preaching. Then he left home and the church
                                        together; and he has never been to either, to remain,
                                        since."</p>
            <p>"Does he ever go to church?" I asked.</p>
            <p>The Deacon shrugged his shoulders. "I asked him that question
                                        myself the other day," said he. "You never go to church, Mr.
                                        Gear, I believe?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes I do," he replied. "I go home every Christmas to spend a
                                        week. And at home I always go to church for the sake of the
                                        old folks. At Wheathedge I always stay away for my own
                                        sake."</p>
            <p>"And what do you know of his theology?" said I.</p>
            <pb n="92"/>
            <p>"Theology," said the Deacon; "he hasn't any. His creed is the
                                        shortest and simplest one I know of. I tried to have a
                                        religious conversation with him once but I had to give it
                                        up. I could make nothing out of him. He said he believed in
                                        the existence of a God. But he scouted the idea that we
                                        could know anything about Him. He was rather inclined to
                                        think there was a future life; but nobody knew anything
                                        about it. All that we could know was that if we are virtuous
                                        in this life we shall be happy in the next—if
                                        there is a next."</p>
            <p>"He does not believe that the gates are wide open there," said I.</p>
            <p>"No," said the Deacon; "nor ajar either."</p>
            <p>"And what does he say of Christ and Christianity," said I.</p>
            <p>"Of Jesus Christ," said the Deacon,
                                        "that—well—probably such a man lived,
                                        and was a very pure and holy man, and a very remarkable
                                        teacher, certainly for his age a <emph>very</emph>
                                        remarkable teacher. But he ridicules the idea of the
                                        miracles; says he does not believe them any more than he
                                        believes in the mythical legends of Greek and Roman
                                        literature. And as to <orig>Chris-</orig>

                                        for America than any other religion; but he rather thinks
                                        Buddhism is very likely better for India."</p>
            <p>"But I wish you would go and see him," continued the Deacon.
                                        "Perhaps you can make something out of him. I can't. I have
                                        tried again and again, and I always get the worst of it. He
                                        is well read, I assure you, and keen as—as," the
                                        Deacon failed in his search for a simile and closed his
                                        sentence with—"a great deal keener than I am. He's
                                        a real good fellow, but he doesn't believe in anything.
                                        There is no use in quoting Scripture, because he thinks it's
                                        nothing but a collection of old legends. I once tried to
                                        argue the question of inspiration with him. 'Deacon,' said
                                        he to me, 'suppose a father should start off one fine
                                        morning to carry his son up to the top of
                                        Huricane Hill and put him to death there, and
                                        should pretend he had a revelation from God to do it, what
                                        would you do to him?' 'Put him in the insane asylum,' said
                                        I. 'Exactly,' said he. 'My boys came home from your Sabbath
                                        School the other Sunday full of the sacrifice of Isaac, and
                                                Will,<pb n="94"/> who takes
                                        after his father, asked me if I didn't think it was cruel
                                        for God to tell a father to kill his own son. What could I
                                        say? I don't often interfere, because it troubles my wife
                                        so. But I couldn't stand that, and I told him very frankly
                                        that I didn't believe the story, and if it was true I
                                        thought Abraham was crazy.' He had me there, you know,"
                                        continued the Deacon, good-naturedly, "but then I never was
                                        good for anything in discussion. I wish you would go to see
                                        him, may be you would bring him to terms."</p>
            <p>And so I was going now, not without misgivings, and with no great
                                        faith in any capacity on my part to "bring him to terms," as
                                        the Deacon phrased it, but buoyed up a good deal,
                                        notwithstanding, by the remembrance of those promised
                                        prayers.</p>
            <p>And yet though Mr. Gear is an infidel he is not a bad man. Even
                                        Dr. Argure, and he is fearfully sound on the doctrine of
                                        total depravity, admits that there are some good traits
                                        about him, "natural virtues" he is careful to explain, not
                                        "saving graces."</p>
            <p>Of his thorough, incorruptible honesty, no<pb n="95"/> man ever intimated a doubt. In every
                                        business transaction he is the soul of honor. His word is a
                                        great deal better than Jim Wheaton's bond.</p>
            <p>In every good work he is a leader. When the new school-house was
                                        to be built, Mr. Gear was put, by an almost unanimous
                                        consent, upon the Board, and made its treasurer. When, last
                                        Fall, rumors were rife of the mismanagement of the
                                        Poor-house, Mr. Gear was the one to demand an investigation,
                                        and, being put upon the Committee, to push through against a
                                        good deal of opposition, till he secured the reform that was
                                        needed. In his shop there is not a man whose personal
                                        history he does not know, not one who does not count him a
                                        personal friend. That there has not been a strike for ten
                                        years is due to the workmen's personal faith in him. When
                                        Robert Dale was caught in the shafting and killed last
                                        winter, it was Mr. Gear who paid the widow's rent out of his
                                        own pocket, got the eldest son a place on a farm, and
                                        carried around personally a subscription to provide for the
                                        family, after starting it handsomely himself. He is
                                        appointed to arbitrate<pb n="96"/> in half
                                        the incipient quarrels of the neighborhood, and settles more
                                        controversies, I am confident, than his neighbor, Squire
                                        Hodgson, though the latter is a Justice of the Peace. There
                                        is always difficulty in collecting our pew rents. Half the
                                        church members are from one week to one quarter behind-hand.
                                        Mr. Gear has a pew for his family, and his pew-rent is
                                        always paid before it becomes due. The Deacon tells me
                                        confidentially, that Mr. Work does not think it prudent to
                                        preach against intemperance because Jim Wheaton always has
                                        wine on his table New Year's day. Mr. Gear is the head of
                                        the Good Templars, and has done more to circulate the pledge
                                        among the workmen of the town than all the rest of us put
                                        together. He is naturally an intensely passionate man, and I
                                        am told rips out an oath now and then. But that he is
                                        vigorously laboring with himself to control his temper is
                                        very evident, and it is equally evident, so at least the
                                        Deacon says, that he is gaining a victory in this
                                        life-campaign.</p>
            <p>"It is very clear," said I to myself, as I walked along, "that
                                        there are some good points in Mr. Gear's character. He must
                                        have a side<pb n="97"/> where
                                        Christian truth could get in, if one could only find it;
                                        where indeed it does get in, though he thinks, and every one
                                        else thinks, it does not. Be it my task to find the

            <p>A pretty little cottage—white, with green blinds; the
                                        neatest of neat fences; a little platform in front of the
                                        sidewalk with three steps leading up to it,—a
                                        convenient method of access to our high country carriages;
                                        two posts before the gate neatly turned, a trellis over the
                                        front door with a climbing rose which has mounted half way
                                        to the top and stopped to rest for the season; another
                                        trellis fan-shaped behind which a path disappears that leads
                                        round to the kitchen door; the tastiest of little bird
                                        houses, now tenantless and desolate,—this is the
                                        picture that meets my eye and assures me that Mr. Gear is a
                                        man both of taste and thrift, as indeed he is.</p>

                                        a cheerful little body with yet a tinge of sadness in her
                                        countenance, as one who knows some secret sorrow which her
                                        blithe heart cannot wholly sing away, is very glad to see
                                        me. She calls me by my name and <orig>in-</orig>

                                        troduces herself with a grace that is as much more graceful
                                        as it is more natural than the polished and stately manners
                                        which Mrs. Wheaton has brought with her from fashionable
                                        society to Wheathedge. Mr. Gear is out, he has gone down to
                                        the shop,—will I walk in,—he will be
                                        back directly. I am very happy to walk in, and Mrs. Gear
                                        introducing me to a cozy little sitting-room with a library
                                        table in the centre, and a book-case on one side, well
                                        filled too, takes Harry by the hand, and leads him out to
                                        introduce him to the great Newfoundland dog whom we saw
                                        basking in the sunshine on the steps of the side door, as we
                                        came up the road.</p>
            <p>I am accustomed to judge of men by their companions, and books
                                        are companions. So whenever I am in a parlor alone I always
                                        examine the book-case, or the centre table—if
                                        there is one. In Mrs. Wheaton's parlor I find no book-case,
                                        but a large centre table on which there are several annuals
                                        with a great deal of gilt binding and very little reading,
                                        and a volume or two of plates, sometimes handsome, more
                                        often showy. In the library, which opens out of the parlor,
                                        I find sets of the classic authors in<pb n="100"/> library bindings,
                                        but when I take one down it betrays the fact that no other
                                        hand has touched it to open it before. And I know that Jim
                                        Wheaton buys books to furnish his house, just as he buys
                                        wall paper and carpets. At Mr. Hardcap's I find a big family
                                        Bible, and half a dozen of those made up volumes fat with
                                        thick paper and large type, and showy with poor pictures,
                                        which constitute the common literature of two thirds of our
                                        country homes. And I know that poor Mr. Hardcap is the
                                        unfortunate victim of book agents. At Deacon Goodsole's I
                                        always see some school books lying in admirable confusion on
                                        the sitting-room table. And I know that Deacon Goodsole has
                                        children, and that they bring their books home at night to
                                        do some real studying, and that they do it in the family
                                        sitting-room and get help now and then from father and from
                                        mother. And so while I am waiting for Mr. Gear I take a
                                        furtive glance at his well filled shelves. I am rather
                                        surprized to find in his little library so large a religious
                                        element, though nearly all of it heterodox. There is a
                                        complete edition of Theodore Parker's works, Channing's
                                        works, a volume<pb n="101"/> or
                                        two of Robertson, one of Furness, the English translation of
                                        Strauss' Life of Christ, Renan's Jesus, and half a dozen
                                        more similar books, intermingled with volumes of history,
                                        biography, science, travels, and the New American
                                        Cyclopedia. The <title>Radical</title> and the
                                                <title>Atlantic Monthly</title> are on the table.
                                        The only orthodox book is Beecher's Sermons,—and I
                                        believe Dr. Argure says they are not orthodox; the only
                                        approach to fiction is one of Oliver Wendell Holmes' books,
                                        I do not now remember which one. "Well," said I to myself,
                                        "whatever this man is, he is not irreligious."</p>
            <p>I had just arrived at this conclusion when Mr. Gear entered. A
                                        tall, thin, nervous man, with a high forehead, piercing
                                        black eyes, and a restless uneasiness that forbids him from
                                        ever being for a moment still. Now he runs his hand through
                                        his hair pushing it still further back from his dome of a
                                        head, now he drums the table with his uneasy fingers, now he
                                        crosses and uncrosses his long legs, and once, as our
                                        conversation grows animated, he rises from his seat in the
                                        vehemence of his earnestness, and leans against the mantel
                                        piece. A clear-eyed, frank<pb n="102"/> faced, fine looking man, who would compel your heed if
                                        you met him anywhere, unknown, by chance, on the public
                                        street. "An infidel you may be," I say to myself, "but not a
                                        bad man; on the contrary a man with much that is true and
                                        noble, or I am no physiognomist or phrenologist either." And
                                        I rather pride myself on being both.</p>
            <p>We lawyers learn to study the faces of our witnesses, to form
                                        quick judgments, and to act upon them. If I did not mistake
                                        my man the directest method was the best, and I employed it.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Gear," said I, "I have come to ask you to join my Bible
                                        class."</p>
            <p>"Me!" said Mr. Gear unmistakeably surprised. "I don't believe in
                                        the Bible."</p>
            <p>"So I have heard," I said quietly. "And that's the reason I came
                                        to you first. In fact I do not want you to join my Bible
                                        class. I have not got any Bible class as yet, I want you to
                                        join me in getting one up."</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear smiled incredulously. "You had better get Deacon
                                        Goodsole," said he,—"or," and the smile changed
                                        from a goodnatured to a sarcastic one, "or Mr. Hardcap."</p>
            <pb n="103"/>
            <p>"I have no doubt they would either of them join me," said I. "But
                                        they believe substantially as I have been taught to believe
                                        about the Bible. They have learned to look at it through
                                        creeds, and catechisms, and orthodox preaching. I want to
                                        get a fresh look at it. I want to come to it as I would come
                                        to any other book, and to find out what it means, not what
                                        it seems to mean to a man who has been bred to believe that
                                        it is only the flesh and blood of which the dry bones are
                                        the Westminster Assembly's Catechism."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Laicus," said Mr. Gear, "I thank you for the honor you do
                                        me. But I don't believe in the Bible. I don't believe it's
                                        the word of God any more than Homer or Tacitus. I don't
                                        believe those old Hebrews knew any more than we
                                        do—nor half so much. It says the world was made in
                                        six days. I think it more likely it was six millions of
                                        years in making."</p>
            <p>"So do I," said I.</p>
            <p>"It says God rested on the Sabbath day. I believe He always
                                        works, day and night, summer and winter, in every blazing
                                        fire, in every gathering storm, in every rushing river, in
                                        every growing flower, in every falling leaf."</p>
            <pb n="104"/>
            <p>He rose as he spoke and stood, now leaning against the mantel
                                        piece, now standing erect, his dark eyes flashing, his great
                                        forehead seeming to expand with great thoughts, his soul all
                                        enkindled with his own eloquence: for eloquent he really
                                        was, and all unconscious of it.</p>
            <p>"Your Bible," said he "shuts God up in a Temple, and in an ark in
                                        that, and hides him behind curtains where the High priest
                                        can find him but once a year. My God is every where. There
                                        is no church that can hold him. The heavens are his home;
                                        the earth is his footstool. All this bright and beautiful
                                        world is his temple. He is in every mountain, in every
                                        cloud, in every winter wind and every summer breeze."</p>
            <p>He looked so handsome in his earnest eloquence that I had no
                                        heart to interrupt him. And yet I waited and watched for any
                                        opening he might give me, and thought of Jennie, and her
                                        prayers at home, and declared to myself by God's help I
                                        would not let this man go till I had caught him and brought
                                        him to know the love that now he knew not.</p>
            <p>"Your Bible, Mr. Laicus," said he, "sets apart one day for the
                                        Lord and gives all the rest to<pb n="105"/> the world, the flesh, and the devil.
                                        I believe all days are divine, all days are the Lord's, all
                                        hours are sacred hours and all ground is holy ground."</p>
            <p>I wanted to tell him that my Bible did no such thing. But I had
                                        fully considered what I would do before I had sought this
                                        interview. I had resolved that nothing should tempt me into
                                        a contradiction or an argument. I had studied Jennie's
                                        method, and I reserved my fire.</p>
            <p>"Your Bible tells me," said he, "that God wrote his laws with his
                                        finger on two tables of stone; that he tried to preserve
                                        them from destruction by bidding them be kept in a sacred
                                        ark; and that despite his care they were broken in pieces
                                        before Moses got down from the mountain top. I believe he
                                        writes them impartially in nature and in our hearts, that
                                        science interprets them, and that no Moses astonished out of
                                        his presence of mind can harm them or break the tablets on
                                        which they are engraven."</p>
            <p>So true, yet oh so false. Oh God! help me to teach him what my
                                        Bible really is and what its glorious teachings are.</p>
            <p>"I don't believe the Bible is the Word of God. I can't believe
                                        it. I don't believe the laws of<pb n="106"/> Moses are any more
                                        inspired than the laws of Solon, or the books of Samuel and
                                        Kings than the history of Tacitus, or the Psalms of David
                                        than the Paradise Lost of Milton, or—you'll think
                                        me bold indeed to say so Mr. Laicus," (he was cooler now and
                                        spoke more slowly), "the words of Jesus, than the precepts
                                        of Confucius or the dialogues of Plato."</p>
            <p>In that sentence he gave to me my clue. I seized it instantly,
                                        and never lost it from that moment. Never case in court so
                                        thrilled me with excitement as I too arose and leaned
                                        against the mantel-piece. And never was I, in tone and
                                        manner, calmer.</p>
            <p>"As much so?" I asked carelessly.</p>
            <p>"Yes....." said he, hesitatingly, "yes..... as much so I
                                        suppose."</p>
            <p>"The ten commandments have been before the world for over three
                                        thousand years," said I. "The number that have learned them
                                        and accepted them as a guide, and found in them a practical
                                        help is to be counted by millions. There is hardly a child
                                        in Wheathedge that does not know something of them, and has
                                        not been made better for them; and hardly a man who<pb n="107"/> knows Solon
                                        even by name. We can hardly doubt that the one is as well
                                        worth studying as the other, Mr. Gear."</p>
            <p>"No," said Mr. Gear. "I don't deny that they are worth studying.
                                        But I do deny that they are inspired."</p>
            <p>"The Psalms of David have supplied the Christian church with its
                                        best psalmody for nearly three thousand years," continued I.
                                        "They constitute the reservoir from which Luther, and Watts,
                                        and Wesley, and Doddridge, and a host of other singers have
                                        drawn their inspiration, and in which myriads untold have
                                        found the expression of their highest and holiest
                                        experiences, myriads who never heard of Homer. They are
                                        surely as well worth studying as his noble epics."</p>
            <p>"I don't deny, they are worth studying," said Mr. Gear. "I only
                                        assert that they ought to be studied as any other books of
                                        noble thoughts, intermingled with grossest errors, should be
                                        studied."</p>
            <p>"The words of Jesus," I continued more slowly than before "have
                                        changed the life and character of more than half the world,
                                        that half which<pb n="108"/> alone
                                        possesses modern civilization, that half with which you and
                                        I, Mr. Gear, are most concerned. There was wonderful power
                                        in the doctrines of Buddha. But Buddhism has relapsed
                                        everywhere into the grossest of idolatries. There is a
                                        wonderful wealth of moral truth in the ethics of Confucius.
                                        But the ethics of Confucius have not saved the Chinese
                                        nation from stagnation and death. There is wonderful
                                        life-awaking power in the writings of Plato. But they are
                                        hid from the common people in a dead language, and when a
                                        Prof. Jowett gives them glorious resurrection in our
                                        vernacular, they are still hid from the common people by
                                        their subtlety. Every philosopher ought to study Plato.
                                        Every scholar may profitably study Buddha and Confucius. But
                                        every intelligent American ought to study the life and words
                                        of Jesus of Nazareth."</p>
            <p>"I do," said Mr. Gear. "I do not disesteem Jesus of Nazareth. I
                                        honor him as first among men. I revere his noble life, his
                                        sublime death, and his incomparable teachings. I have read
                                        his life in the Gospels; I have read it as Strauss gives it;
                                        and as Renan gives it; and now I am devoting my Sunday
                                        afternoons to reading it as<pb n="109"/> Pressense gives it. You see I am an
                                        impartial student. I read all sides."</p>
            <p>"You think Christ's life and teaching worth your study then?" I
                                        said inquiringly.</p>
            <p>"Worth my study? Of course I do," said he. "I am an infidel, Mr.
                                        Laicus; at least people commonly call me so, and think it
                                        very dreadful. But I do not mean to be ignorant of the Bible
                                        or of Christianity as Jesus Christ gave it to us. It needs
                                        winnowing. We have grown wiser and know better about many
                                        things since then. But it is well worth the studying and
                                        will be for many years to come."</p>
            <p>"All I ask of you," said I, "is to let me to study it with you."</p>
            <p>He made no answer; but looked me steadily in the eye as if to try
                                        and fathom some occult design.</p>
            <p>"No," said I, "that is not all. As I came by Joe Poole's I saw
                                        half a dozen of the men from your shop lounging about the
                                        door. They could spend the afternoon to better purpose, Mr.
                                        Gear, in studying the life and words of Jesus."</p>
            <p>"I know they could," he said. "No man can<pb n="110"/> say that any word or
                                        influence of mine helped carry them to Joe Poole's bar."</p>
            <p>"Will you lend your word and influence with mine to summon them
                                        away?" said I.</p>
            <p>He made no answer.</p>
            <p>"I saw a dozen others engaged at a game of ball upon the green as
                                        I passed by."</p>
            <p>"A harmless sport, Mr. Laicus, and as well done on Sunday as on
                                        any other holiday."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps," said I. "But an hour and a half from their Sunday in
                                        studying the life and words of Jesus would do them no harm,
                                        and detract nothing from their holiday. They do not study so
                                        hard throughout the week that the brain labor would be
                                        injurious."</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear smiled.</p>
            <p>"There is not a man in your shop, Mr. Gear, that would not be
                                        made a better workman, husband, father, citizen, for
                                        studying that life and those teachings one hour a week."</p>
            <p>"It is true," said he.</p>
            <p>"You organized a Shakspeare club last winter to keep them from
                                        Joe Poole's," said I. "Was it a good thing?"</p>
            <p>"Worked capitally," said Mr. Gear.</p>
            <p>"Won't you join me in organizing a Bible<pb n="111"/> club for Sunday afternoons this
                                        winter for the same purpose?"</p>
            <p>"There is so little in common between us," said he; and he looked
                                        me through and through with his sharp black eyes. What a
                                        lawyer he would have made; what a cross examination he could
                                        conduct.</p>
            <p>"You believe in the literal inspiration of the New Testament
                                        Scripture. I believe it is a book half legend half history.
                                        You believe in the miracles. I believe they are mythical
                                        addition of a later date. You believe that Jesus Christ was
                                        conceived of the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary. I
                                        believe his birth was as natural as his death was cruel and
                                        untimely. You believe that—he was divine. I
                                        believe he was a man of like passions as we ourselves
                                        are,—a Son of God only as every noble spirit is a
                                        spark struck off from the heavenly Original. You believe
                                        that he bears our sins upon a tree. I believe that every
                                        soul must bear its own burdens. What is there in common
                                        between us? What good could it do to you or to me to take
                                        Sunday afternoon for a weekly tournament, with the young men
                                        from the shop for arbitrators?"</p>
            <pb n="112"/>
            <p>"None," said I calmly.</p>
            <p>"What would you have then?" said he.</p>
            <p>"When you organized that Shakspeare club last winter," said I,
                                        "did you occupy your time in discussions of the text? Did
                                        you compare manuscripts? Did you investigate the canonicity
                                        of Shakspeare's various plays? Did you ransack the past to
                                        know the value of the latest theory that there never was a
                                        Will. Shakspeare save as a nom de
                                        plume for Lord Bacon? Did you inquire into the
                                        origin of his several plots, and study to know how much of
                                        his work was really his own and how much was borrowed from
                                        foreign sources. Or did you leave that all to the critics,
                                        and take the Shakspeare of today, and gather what
                                        instruction you might therefrom?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear nodded his head slowly, and thoughtfully, as if he
                                        partially perceived the meaning of my answer. But he made no
                                        other response.</p>
            <p>"There is much in common between us, Mr. Gear," I continued
                                        earnestly, "though much, very much that is not. We can find
                                        plenty of subject for fruitless debate no doubt. Can we find
                                        none for agreement and mutual helpfulness?<pb n="113"/> Jesus of Nazareth you

                                        sublime death, His incomparable teachings. So do I. That
                                        noble life we can read together, Mr. Gear, and together we
                                        may emulate His example without a fruitless debate whether
                                        it be divine or no. Those incomparable teachings we can
                                        study together, that together we may catch the spirit that
                                        dictated them, without a theological controversy as to their
                                        authority. And even that sublime death I should hope we
                                        might contemplate together, without contention, though in
                                        the suffering Christ you see only a martyr, and I behold my
                                        Saviour and my God."</p>
            <p>He made no answer, still stood silent. But he no longer looked at
                                        me with his sharp eyes. They had retired beneath his shaggy
                                        eyebrows as though he would search his own soul through and
                                        through, and read its verdict. He told me afterwards the
                                        story of his battle; I guessed it even then.</p>
            <p>"We may not agree on the Gospel of John, Mr. Gear," said I, "but
                                        we shall not quarrel about the Golden Rule and the Sermon on
                                        the Mount."</p>
            <pb n="114"/>
            <p>"Mr. Laicus," said Mr. Gear at length, very slowly. "I thank you
                                        for coming to me, I thank you for speaking plainly and
                                        frankly as you have; I thank you for the respect which you
                                        have shown to my convictions. They are honest, and were not
                                        arrived at without a struggle and some self sacrifice. You
                                        are the first Christian," he added bitterly "that ever paid
                                        them the regard of a respectful hearing. I will join you in
                                        that Bible Class for this winter, and I will prove to you,
                                        infidel that I am, that I as well as a Christian, can
                                        respect convictions widely different from my own. If we
                                        quarrel it shall not be my fault."</p>
            <p>"I believe you, Mr. Gear," said I. "God helping me it shall not
                                        be mine, and there's my hand upon it."</p>
            <p>He grasped it warmly.</p>
            <p>"When shall we begin?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Next Sunday."</p>
            <p>"Where?" said I.</p>
            <p>"As you please?" said he.</p>
            <p>"Here, or in my house, or at the church parlors, or wherever we
                                        can gather the young men," said I.</p>
            <pb n="115"/>
            <p>"The mill school-house is better than either," said he. "The boys
                                        will come there. They are used to it."</p>
            <p>"The mill school-house be it," said I. "Next Sunday afternoon at
                                        3 o'clock. I will bring the Bibles; you will bring the
                                        boys."</p>
            <p>"As many as I can," said he.</p>

            <p>"Jennie," said I that evening. "Mr. Gear and I are going to take
                                        the Bible Class together."</p>
            <p>Tears stood in her eyes as she looked up at me with that smile I
                                        love so much. But she only said. "I knew you would succeed

            <head type="sub">The Deacon's Second Service.</head>
            <p>IT has been made the subject of some comment lately that Deacon
                                        Goodsole habitually absents himself from our Sabbath evening
                                        service. The pastor called the other day to confer with me
                                        on the subject; for he has somehow come to regard me as a
                                        convenient adviser, perhaps because I hold no office and
                                        take no very active part in the management of the Church,
                                        and so am quite free from what may be called its politics.
                                        He said he thought it quite unfortunate; not that the Deacon
                                        needed the second service himself, but that, by absenting
                                        himself from the house of God, he set a very bad example to
                                        the young people of the flock. "We cannot expect," said he,
                                        somewhat mournfully, "that the young people will come to
                                        Church, when the elders themselves stay away." At the same
                                        time he said he felt some delicacy about talking with the
                                        Deacon himself on the subject. "Of course," said he, "if he
                                        does not<pb n="117"/> derive
                                        profit from my discourses I do not want to dragoon him into
                                        hearing them."</p>
            <p>I readily promised to seek an occasion to talk with the Deacon,
                                        the more so because I really feel for our pastor. When I
                                        first came to Wheathedge he was full of enthusiasm. He has
                                        various plans for adding attractiveness and interest to our
                                        Sabbath-evening service, which has always flagged. He tried
                                        a course of sermons to young men. He announced sermons on
                                        special topics. Occasionally a political discourse would
                                        draw a pretty full house, but generally it was quite evident
                                        that the second sermon was almost as much of a burden to the
                                        congregation as it was to the minister. Latterly he seems to
                                        have given up these attempts, and to follow the example of
                                        his brethren hereabout. He exchanges pretty often. Quite
                                        frequently we get an agent. Occasionally I fancy, the more
                                        from the pastor's manner than from my recollection, that he
                                        is preaching an old sermon. At other times we get a sort of
                                        expository lecture, the substance of which I find in my copy
                                        of Lange when I get home. Under this treatment the
                                        congregation, never very large, has<pb n="118"/> dwindled away to
                                        quite diminutive proportions; and our poor pastor is quite
                                        discouraged. Until about six weeks ago Deacon Goodsole was
                                        always in his pew. I think his falling off was the last
                                        straw.</p>
            <p>Last Sabbath evening, on my way to church, I stopped, according
                                        to promise, to see the Deacon. As I went up the steps I
                                        heard the sound of music, and waited a moment lest I should
                                        disturb the family's evening devotions. But as the music
                                        continued, and presently the tune changed, I concluded to
                                        knock. Nettie, the Deacon's youngest daughter, who by the
                                        way is a great favorite with me, answered the knock almost
                                        instantly. The open hymn-book was in her hand, and before I
                                        could get time to ask for the Deacon, she had, in her
                                        charmingly impulsive way, dragged me in, snatched my hat
                                        from my hand, deposited it on the table, and pushed me into
                                        the parlor. In fact, before I well knew what I was about, I
                                        found myself in the big arm-chair with Nettie in my lap,
                                        taking part in the Deacon's second service.</p>
            <p>His family were all about him, including the stable boy, whose
                                        hair looked as sleek as the<pb n="119"/> Deacon's horse. For the Deacon has
                                        some queer notions about the duties of employers to their
                                        servants, and, though the very kindest of men, is generally
                                        thought by the neighbors to be "a queer stick." The Deacon's
                                        wife, who has a very sweet soprano voice, which, however,
                                        she never could be persuaded to use in our choir, was
                                        presiding at the piano. The children all had their hymn and
                                        tune-books, and they were "singing round"—each
                                        member of the family selecting a hymn in turn. As they were
                                        limited to two verses each—except where two
                                        clubbed together to secure an entire hymn—the
                                        exercise was not prolonged, and certainly did not become
                                        tedious. After the singing, the Deacon asked the children if
                                        they were ready with their verses. They all raised their
                                        hands. The Deacon then repeated a short piece of poetry, his
                                        wife followed, and then all the children one after another,
                                        even down to Bob—a little three-year-old, who just
                                        managed to lisp out, with a charming mixture of pride and
                                        bashfulness, <quote>

            <p>Then the Deacon took down the family bible and opened it to the
                                        story of Joseph. He asked the children how far he had got.
                                        They answered him very sagely, and their responses to a few
                                        questions which he put to them showed that they understood
                                        what had gone before. Then he read part of one chapter, that
                                        which describes the beginning of the famine, and, asking Joe
                                        to bring him the full volume of Stanley's Jewish Church, he
                                        read the admirable description of an Egyptian famine which
                                        it contains. By this time Bob was fast asleep in his
                                        mother's arms. But all the rest of us kneeled down and
                                        repeated the Lord's prayer with the Deacon—another
                                        of his queer notions. The neighbors think he is inclined to
                                        be an Episcopalian, because he wants it introduced into the
                                        church service, but he says he does not really think that
                                        the Lord was an Episcopalian, and if he was it would not be
                                        any good reason for not using his prayer. Then the children
                                        kissed good-night, all round, and went to bed. Mrs. Goodsole
                                        took Bob off to his crib, and the Deacon and I were left
                                        alone. It was long past time for church service to begin, so
                                        I abandoned all idea of going<pb n="121"/> to church, and opened to the Deacon
                                        at once the object of my errand. I told him very frankly
                                        that we not only missed him from the church, but that the
                                        pastor felt that his example was an unfortunate one, and
                                        that the church generally were afraid he was growing
                                        luke-warm in the Master's service, and I gently reminded him
                                        of the apostle's direction not to forget the assembling of
                                        ourselves together.</p>
            <p>"Well," said he—though in trying to give his answer in
                                        his own language, I am obliged to condense the conversation
                                        of half-an-hour into a single paragraph—"Well, I
                                        will tell you how it is. You know I used to be pretty
                                        regular in attendance on church, and in fact a pretty busy
                                        man on Sundays. We had breakfast early. Right after
                                        breakfast I sat down to look over my Sunday-school lesson
                                        for the last time. At nine o'clock I went to Sunday-school,
                                        where I had a Bible-class. At half-past ten came church.
                                        After service I had barely time to get a lunch, and then had
                                        to hurry away to our Mission. We almost always had some sort
                                        of a teachers' meeting after the regular session, so that it
                                        was generally tea-time before I got home. After tea<pb n="122"/> I was off to church
                                        again. I almost always woke up Monday morning tired, and a
                                        little cross. My children are pretty good ones, I think, but
                                        they had a queer distaste for Sunday, which I put down to
                                        total depravity. And, strangest of all, my wife, who only
                                        went to church Sunday morning, and would not even sing in
                                        the choir, seemed to be as tired Monday morning as I was,
                                        only as it was washing-day she could not sleep as late.
                                        About two months ago I was laid up with a boil, and could
                                        not go to church. Of course I did not have my Sunday-school
                                        lesson to learn, and I was surprised to notice, for the
                                        first time, how hard my wife had to work to get the children
                                        off to Sunday-school. They stayed at church—as
                                        they always do—and for an hour after dinner they
                                        got along very well, reading their library books, but then
                                        began the labors of the day. First I heard Joe out in the
                                        yard frolicking with the dog, and rousing all the
                                        neighborhood with his racket. Of course I called him in.
                                        Next I heard my wife calling Lucy and Nettie to come down
                                        out of the swing. The next thing Bob was playing horse with
                                        the chairs in the parlor. So it went all the <orig>after-</orig>
               <pb n="123"/> noon. The children had
                                        nothing to do. They could not read Sunday-school books all
                                        day. I am heterodox enough to wonder how they can read them
                                        at all—and of course they got into all sorts of
                                        mischief. And when at last poor Bobby came to me in utter
                                        despair, and lisped out, "Papa, what did God make Sunday
                                        for?" I broke down. I gathered the children about me, and
                                        proposed to them this evening service. I told them that if
                                        they would learn a hymn every Sunday I would stay at home in
                                        the evening with them. They caught at the idea
                                        enthusiastically. There is no law about it. They need not
                                        learn if they do not want to. But even Bobby has caught the
                                        enthusiasm, and gets a book and goes to his mamma every
                                        Sunday afternoon to teach him a verse. I have given up my
                                        class in the Mission, and made one of my Sunday-school
                                        Bible-class take it. I lie down and take a little nap after
                                        dinner. Then I learn my own hymn, and make my preparation
                                        for our evening service. About an hour before tea the
                                        children gather about me in the arbor and I read to them. I
                                        have just got Dr. Newton's "Bible Wonders," and am reading
                                        it chapter<pb n="124"/> by
                                        chapter. My wife takes that opportunity to rest. The
                                        consequence is that we both really get refreshed, instead of
                                        jaded out by our Sunday, and I think the children really
                                        look forward with anticipations of delight to its coming.
                                        "My Bible," continued the Deacon good naturedly, "says
                                        something about resting on Sunday. I wish our pastor would
                                        tell us what that means sometime."</p>
            <p>I told the Deacon I thought he ought to tell his brethren, at
                                        some prayer-meeting, the reason why he stayed away from
                                        church; that it was due both to himself and to them. He
                                        agreed to do so. As for myself I am somewhat puzzled. I do
                                        not want our pastor left to preach to empty pews. But I am
                                        greatly enamored of the Deacon's second service.</p>

            <p>ALL Wheathedge is in a fever of excitement. "Blessings brighten
                                        as they take their flight." We have just learned that we
                                        have enjoyed for these several years the ministry of one of
                                        the most energetic, faithful, assiduous, eloquent, and
                                        devoted "sons of thunder," in the State. We never
                                        appreciated our dominie aright till now. But now no one can
                                        praise him too highly. The cause of this his sudden rise in
                                        public estimation is a very simple one. He has been called
                                        to a New York City parish. And he has accepted the call.</p>
            <p>This is a curious world, and the most curious part of it is the
                                        Church. While he stayed we grumbled at him. Now he leaves we
                                        grumble because he is going.</p>
            <p>I first heard of this matter a couple of weeks ago. No. Some
                                        rumors of what was threatened were in the air last summer.
                                        One Sabbath, in our congregation, were three gentlemen, in
                                                one<pb n="126"/> of whom
                                        I recognised my friend, Mr. Eccles, of
                                        the——street Presbyterian Church of New
                                        York City. He was there again the second Sabbath. It was
                                        rumored then that he was on a tour of inspection. But I paid
                                        little attention to the rumor. In October, our pastor takes
                                        his vacation. I thought it a little strange that he should
                                        spend half of it in New York, and seek rest from preaching
                                        in his own pulpit by repeating his sermons in a metropolitan
                                        church. But I knew the state of his purse. I therefore gave
                                        very little heed to the gossip which my wife repeated to me,
                                        and which she had picked up in the open market. For Sunday
                                        is market day, and the church is the market for village
                                        gossip in Wheathedge. And Jennie, who is constitutionally
                                        averse to change, was afraid we were going to lose our
                                        pastor, and said as much. But I laughed at her fears.</p>
            <p>However, the result proved that the gossips were, for once,
                                        right. About two weeks ago, Mr. and Mrs. Work came into my
                                        house in a high state of subdued excitement. Mr. Work handed
                                        me a letter. It was a call to
                                        the——street Presbyterian Church in New
                                                York—salary<pb n="127"/> $4000 a year. It was accompanied by
                                        a glowing portraiture of the present and prospective
                                        usefulness which this field opened. The church was situated
                                        in a part of the city where there were few or no churches.
                                        The ward had a population of over fifty thousand, a large
                                        majority of whom attended no church. More than half were
                                        Protestants. There was a grand field for Sabbath-school
                                        labor. The church was thoroughly united. Its financial
                                        condition was satisfactory, and its prospects encouraging.
                                        And the hearts of the people had been led to unite as one
                                        man upon Mr. Work.</p>
            <p>"I cannot but think," said Mr. Work, "that it is Providential.
                                        The position is entirely unsought. Yet I do not really feel
                                        equal to a place of such importance. I am sensible how much
                                        wider is the sphere of usefulness. But am I able to fill it?
                                        That is the question."</p>
            <p>"Well, for my part," said Mrs. Work, "I confess that I am
                                        mercenary. There is a great deal of difference between
                                        $1,200 and $4,000 a year. It will put us at our ease at
                                        once. And just think what advantages for the children."</p>
            <p>They wanted my advice. At least they said<pb n="128"/> so. It is my private
                                        opinion that they wanted me to advise them to go. I told
                                        them I would think about it and tell them the result the
                                        next week. They agreed meanwhile to wait.</p>
            <p>There were two considerations which operated on their minds, one
                                        usefulness, the other salary. I undertook to measure those
                                        two considerations.</p>
            <p>The very next day gave me an opportunity to investigate the
                                        former. I met my friend Mr. Eccles at Delmonico's. We talked
                                        over the affairs of his church at the table.</p>
            <p>"You are trying to get our minister away from us," said I.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said he. "And I think we shall get him. He is a sound
                                        man—just the man to build us up."</p>
            <p>"And how are you prospering?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Capitally," said he. And then he proceeded, in answer to a
                                        cross-examination, to interpret his reply. The Church had
                                        almost a monopoly of the ward. Its debt was but $10,000,
                                        which was in a mortgage on the property. There was also a
                                        small floating debt which would be easily provided for. It
                                        paid its former pastor $4,000, just what it offered Mr.
                                                Work.<pb n="129"/> Its
                                        pew rents were about $3,500. The deficiency was
                                        considerable, and had to be made up every year by
                                        subscription. "But our minister," said M. Eccles,
                                        confidentially, "was a dull preacher. I liked
                                        him—my wife liked him. All the church folks liked
                                        him. But he did not draw. And it is not enough in New York
                                        city, Mr. Laicus, for a minister to be a good man, or even a
                                        good preacher. He must draw. That's it; he must
                                        <emph>draw</emph>. I expect the first year, that we shall
                                        have a deficit to make up, but if next spring we don't let
                                        all our pews, why I am mistaken in my man, that's all.
                                        Besides they say he is a capital man to get money out of
                                        people, and we must pay off our debt or we will never
                                        succeed, and that's a fact."</p><p>I got some figures from Mr. Eccles, and put them down. They give
                                                                    the following result: </p><table>

            <p>When I showed the footing to Mr. Eccles he shrugged his
                                        shoulders. "We shall have to raise our pew rents," said he.
                                        "They are unconscionably low, and we <emph>must</emph> pay
                                        off our debt. Then we are all right. And if we get the right
                                        man, one that can <emph>draw</emph>, he will put our heads
                                        above water."</p>
            <p>With that we separated.</p>
            <p>Not, however, till I got some further information from him. He
                                        remarked casually that he had a notion of moving out of
                                        town, and asked me about prices at Wheathedge. "It costs a
                                        fortune to live here," said he. "My wife has an allowance of
                                        $300 a month for household and personal expenses. My
                                        clothing and extras cost me another $500. And the "sundries"
                                        are awful. You can't go out of your house for less than a
                                        dollar. I have no doubt my incidentals are another $500. It
                                        is awful—awful."</p>
            <p>I advised him to move up to Wheathedge, the more cordially
                                        because I have a lot I would like to sell him for about a
                                        thousand dollars. I really believe he is thinking seriously
                                        of it.</p>
            <p>The next day I went into the office of my<pb n="131"/> friend Mr. Rental, the broker. I
                                        told him I was looking for a house for a friend, and asked
                                        the prices. He showed me a list—rents $2,000,
                                        $2,500, $3,000. They were too high. Would property in
                                        Brooklyn or Jersey City do? No. It must be in New York. It
                                        must be in the ——ward. It must be a
                                        good, comfortable, plain house, without any show or
                                        pretension.</p>
            <p>"There are none such to let in the city," said Mr. Rental. "Land
                                        costs too much. The few plain houses are all occupied by
                                        their owners." The very best he could do was one house, half
                                        a mile from the church, for $1,800. He had one other for
                                        $1,500, but it was opposite an immense stable, and had
                                        neither cellar nor furnace, and croton only on the first
                                        floor. I thanked him and said I would look in again if
                                        either of them suited.</p>
            <p>Last week, according to appointment, our pastor and his wife came
                                        in for a second consultation.</p>
            <p>"There are," said I, "two considerations which might lead you to
                                        accept this call—increased usefulness and
                                        increased salary. I do not deny the importance of a New York
                                        city parish, nor<pb n="132"/> fail to
                                        recognize the good work the city ministers are doing. But
                                        you must not fail to recognize the difficulties of the
                                        situation. New York is sensation-mad. The competition in
                                        churches is as great as in business. There are perhaps half
                                        a dozen men of genius who fill their churches with ease, or
                                        whose churches are filled because they are the resort of
                                        "good society." The rest of the ministers are compelled to
                                        devote three-quarters of their energies to keeping a
                                        congregation together, the other quarter to doing them good.
                                        They accomplish the first, sometimes by patient, persistent,
                                        assiduous, unwearying pastoral labor, sometimes by achieving
                                        a public reputation, sometimes by the doubtful expedient of
                                        sensational advertisements of paradoxical topics. But in
                                        whatever way they do it the hardest part of their work, a
                                        part, country parsons know next to nothing of, is to get and
                                        keep a congregation. What you are wanted for at
                                        the——street Presbyterian Church is to
                                        'build it up.' The one quality for which you are commended
                                        is the capacity to 'draw.' Doubtless there are devout
                                        praying men and women who will measure your work by its
                                        spiritual results, by<pb n="133"/> the conversion of sinners and the growth in grace of
                                        Christians. But what the financial managers want is one who
                                        will fill up their empty pews, enable them to add fifty
                                                <emph>per cent</emph>. to the rentals, and in some
                                        way pay off their debt. That will be their measure of your
                                        usefulness."</p>
            <p>It was quite evident that my good pastor and his wife thought me
                                        uncharitable. Was I?</p>
            <p>"As to salary," said I, "you country clergymen are greatly
                                        mistaken in supposing that city salaries are prizes to be
                                        coveted. Six thousand dollars is only a moderately fair
                                        support for a New York clergyman, and there are
                                        comparatively few who get it. You must pay at least $1,800
                                        rent. You must dress as well as the average of your best
                                        families. You must neither be ashamed for yourselves nor for
                                        your children in the best society. You must keep open house.
                                        You must set a good table. You must be "given to
                                        hospitality." You must take a lead in organizing the
                                        missionary and charitable movements of your Church, which
                                        you cannot do without some money. You must be ready to
                                        co-operate in great public, church, and<pb n="134"/> philanthropic
                                        movements. You must take a vacation of six weeks every
                                        summer, which of itself, at the lowest estimate, will cost
                                        you $150 or $200 a year. I have made some inquiries of three
                                        or four economical friends in New York. Here is the result
                                        of my inquiries. You may reduce the figures a little. But it
                                        will require quite as much economy to live in New York on
                                        $4,000 a year as in Wheathedge on $1,200."</p><p>With that I showed them the following memorandum: </p><table>

            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Work thanked me for my advice, and took my
                                        memorandum home with them. But it was quite evident that
                                        Mrs. Work was not satisfied that $4,000 was not a great
                                        advance on $1,200. And I was not at all <orig>sur-</orig>
               <pb n="135"/> prised when Mr. Work read his
                                        resignation from the pulpit last Sabbath. Next Sabbath he
                                        preaches his farewell sermon.</p>
            <p>I hope I may prove a false prophet. But I think Mrs. Work will
                                        find her arithmetical powers taxed in New York as they never
                                        were in Wheathedge, and I shall be more pleased than I can
                                        tell if in five years Mr. Work does not retire from his post
                                        a disappointed man, or find that he has purchased success at

            <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Committee on Supply hold an informal Meeting.</head>
            <p>MR. Work has preached his last sermon. A committee has been
                                        appointed to supply the pulpit, and secure a candidate for
                                        the pastorate. I believe this sort of business is generally
                                        left to the session; but on Deacon Goodsole's motion a
                                        special committee was appointed partly out of respect to the
                                        congregational element which is considerable in this church,
                                        and partly, I suspect, as a compliment to Mr. Wheaton. It
                                        consists of Mr. Wheaton and Mr. Gear, on behalf of the
                                        society, and Deacon Goodsole, Mr. Hardcap and myself on
                                        behalf of the church. I forgot to mention that since our
                                        Bible-class was commenced, Mr. Gear has begun to attend
                                        church, though not very regularly. Mr. Goodsole nominated
                                        Mr. Gear on the committee, and of course he was elected. I
                                        was rather sorry for I would have preferred that he did not
                                        know about the internal workings of this church. I do not<pb n="137"/> think it will
                                        enhance his respect for religious institutions. Still I
                                        could make no objection. I did make objections to taking a
                                        place on the committee myself, but Jennie persuaded me to
                                        relinquish them. She has often heard me arguing that
                                        politics is a duty, that citizens are bound to take and
                                        administer public office for the benefit of the State. By a
                                        neat little turn she set all these arguments against me, and
                                        as I could not answer them I was obliged to yield. Our
                                        wives' memories are sometimes dreadfully inconvenient.</p>
            <p>Our committee held a sort of informal meeting last night, at the
                                        Post-Office, where we all met by chance, the usual way. In
                                        the Post-Office is the news exchange of Wheathedge, where we
                                        are very apt to meet about the time of the arrival of the
                                        evening mail. Deacon Goodsole had been delegated to get a
                                        supply for the next two Sabbaths till we could discuss the
                                        merits of candidates. He reported that he had engaged the
                                        Rev. Mr. Elder, of Wheatensville. "He has the merest
                                        pittance of a salary," said the Deacon, "and I knew the
                                        twenty dollars would be acceptable to him. Besides which he
                                        is not only an excellent man but a sound preacher."</p>
            <pb n="138"/>
            <p>"Why wouldn't he be the man for us?" said I.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton exclaimed against me, "Too old," said he.</p>
            <p>"Besides he's got five children," said Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>"What's that got to do with it?" said I. "So has Deacon Goodsole;
                                        but he's none the worse for that."</p>
            <p>"We can't afford to support a man with a large family," said Mr.
                                        Hardcap. "We must get a young man. We can't possibly afford
                                        to pay over $1,200 a year, and we ought not to pay over
                                        $1,000."</p>
            <p>"Oh!" said I; "do we grade the ministers' salaries by the number
                                        of the minister's children?"</p>
            <p>"Well we have to consider that, of course," said Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>"Solomon wasn't so wise as he is generally thought to be," said
                                        Mr. Gear sarcastically, "or he never would have written that
                                        sentence about blessed is he whose quiver is full of them!"</p>
            <p>"Well," said Mr. Hardcap, "all I've got to say is, if you get a
                                        man here with five children you can pay his salary, that's
                                        all."</p>
            <p>"When you take a job Mr. Hardcap," said I,<pb n="139"/> "do you expect to be
                                        paid according to the value of the work or according to the
                                        size of your family?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! that's a very different thing," said Mr. Hardcap, "very
                                        different."</p>
            <p>"Any way," said Mr. Wheaton, "Mr. Elder is entirely out of the
                                        question—entirely so. Mr. Laicus can hardly have
                                        proposed him seriously."</p>
            <p>"Why out of the question, gentlemen?" said I. "He is a good
                                        preacher. Our congregation know him. He is a faithful,
                                        devoted pastor. We shall do Wheatensville no injustice, for
                                        it cannot give him a support. As to age, he is certainly not
                                        infirm. I do not believe he is a year over forty-five."</p>
            <p>"No! no!" said Mr. Wheaton, decidedly. "It is utterly out of the
                                        question. We must have a young man, one who is fresh, up
                                        with the spirit of the age; one who can draw in the young
                                        men. The Methodists are getting them all."</p>
            <p>"And the young girls too," said Mr. Gear dryly.</p>
            <p>I wish Mr. Gear were not on this committee. The Deacon meant
                                        well. But he made a blunder.</p>
            <pb n="140"/>
            <p>"Very well, then, gentlemen," said I; "if we want a fresh man let
                                        us go right to the theological seminary and get the best man
                                        we can find there."</p>
            <p>"The seminary!" said Mr. Wheaton. He received this suggestion
                                        even more disdainfully than the previous one. "We must have
                                        a man of experience, Mr. Laicus. A theological student would
                                        never do."</p>
            <p>"Experience without age!" said I; "that's a hard problem to
                                        solve. For the life of me I do not see how we are going to
                                        do it."</p>
            <p>"Well you must consider, Mr. Laicus," said Mr. Wheaton, adding
                                        force to his words by a gentle and impressive gesture with
                                        his forefinger, "that this is a very important and a very
                                        peculiar field—a very peculiar field indeed, Mr.
                                        Laicus. And it requires a man of very peculiar
                                        qualifications. It is really a city field," he continued.
                                        "To all intents and purposes Wheathedge is a suburb of New
                                        York City. In the summer our congregation is very largely
                                        composed of city people. They are used to good preaching.
                                        They won't come to hear a commonplace preacher. And at the
                                        same time we have<pb n="141"/> a
                                        very peculiar native population. And then, apart from our
                                        own people, there is the Mill village which really belongs
                                        to our parish, and which our pastor ought to cultivate. All
                                        these various elements combine to make up a diverse and
                                        conflicting population. And it will require a man of great
                                        energy, and great prudence, and no little knowledge of human
                                        nature, and practical skill in managing men, to get along
                                        here at all. I know more about Wheathedge than you do, Mr.
                                        Laicus, and I assure you that it is a very peculiar field."</p>
            <p>I believe that in the estimation of supply committees all fields
                                        are very peculiar fields. But I did not say anything.</p>
            <p>"And we need a very peculiar man?" said Mr. Gear inquiringly.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Mr. Wheaton, decidedly; "a man of peculiar abilities
                                        and qualifications."</p>
            <p>"Well then," said Mr. Gear, "I hope you are prepared to pay a
                                        peculiar salary. I don't know much about church matters
                                        gentlemen. I don't know what you put me on the committee
                                        for. But in my shop if I want a peculiar man I have to pay a
                                        peculiar salary."</p>
            <pb n="142"/>
            <p>There was a little laugh at this sally, but Mr. Gear evidently
                                        meant no joke, and as evidently Mr. Wheaton did not take
                                        any.</p>
            <p>"Well," said I, "so far as salary goes I am prepared to vote for
                                        an increase to $1,500 and a parsonage. I don't live on less
                                        than twice that."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap struck his hands down resolutely into his pockets and
                                        groaned audibly.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid we can't get it, Mr. Laicus," said Mr. Wheaton. "I
                                        believe a minister ought to have it, but I don't see where
                                                its coming from. We musn't burden the
                                        parish."</p>
            <p>"And I believe," I retorted, "that the laborer is worthy of his
                                        hire; and we must not burden the pastor."</p>
            <p>"For my part," said Mr. Hardcap, "I won't give my consent to a
                                        dollar over $1,200 a year. I ain't goin' to encourage
                                        ministerial luxury nohow."</p>
            <p>"Well, for my part," said Mr. Wheaton, "I don't care so much
                                        about that. But we must have a first rate man. He has to
                                        preach here in the summer time to city congregations. They
                                        are critical sir, critical. And we have got to have just as
                                        good a man as the Broadway<pb n="143"/> Tabernacle. But as to paying a city
                                        salary, that you know is absurd, Mr. Laicus. We can't be
                                        expected to do that."</p>
            <p>"Bricks without straw," murmured Mr. Gear.</p>
            <p>Just then the Post-Office window opened, and we made a rush for
                                        our mail. But before we separated we agreed to hold a formal
                                        meeting at my house a week from the following Thursday
                                        evening for a further canvass of the whole matter.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I am perplexed by the double problem that our informal
                                        meeting has suggested. I have been sitting for half an hour
                                        pondering it. The children have long since gone to bed. I
                                        have finished my evening paper, and written my evening
                                        letters. The fire has burned low, and been replenished.
                                        Jennie sits by my side engaged in that modern imitation of
                                        Penelope's task, the darning of stockings. And for half an
                                        hour, only the ticking of the clock and the sighing of the
                                        wind outside have disturbed the silence of the room.</p>
            <p>"Jennie," said I, at length, "when I told you to-night of our
                                        talk at the Post-Office you said you hoped we would get a
                                        young man. Why?"</p>
            <pb n="144"/>
            <p>"Why?" said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said I. "I can understand why Mr. Hardcap wants a young
                                        man. It is for the same reason that he employs half taught
                                        apprentices in his shop. They are cheap. Of course our good
                                        friend Maurice Mapleson, with neither wife nor children, can
                                        more easily lay up money on $1,000 a year than Mr. Elder,
                                        with his five children can on $1,500 or $2,000. But I don't
                                        think you and I, Jennie, want to economize on our minister."</p>
            <p>"I am sure we don't John," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"And I can understand why Mr. Wheaton wants a young minister.
                                        Young ministers do draw better, at least at first. There is
                                        a certain freshness and attractiveness in youth. Curiosity
                                        is set agog in watching the young minister, and still more
                                        in watching his young bride. A ministerial honey-moon is a
                                        godsend to a parish. Whether we ought to hire our pastors to
                                        set curiosity agog and serve the parish as a nine-day's
                                        wonder may be a question. But I suspect that we very often
                                        do. But, Jennie, I hope you and I don't want a minister to
                                        serve us as food for gossip."</p>
            <p>"I am sure not, John,' said Jennie earnestly.</p>
            <pb n="145"/>
            <p>"Why is it then, Jennie," said I, "that you and I want youth in
                                        our minister? Young lawyers and young doctors are not in
                                        requisition. Age generally brings confidence even when it
                                        does not endow with wisdom. I believe that Judge Ball's
                                        principal qualification for his office was his bald head and
                                        grey beard. When you discovered a couple of grey hairs on my
                                        head a little while ago, I was delighted. I should like to
                                        multiply them. Every grey hair is worth a dollar. Dr. Curall
                                        has hard work to get on in his profession because he is so
                                        young and looks still younger than he is. If there was such
                                        a thing as grey dye it would pay him to employ it. Lawyers
                                        and doctors must be old—ministers must be young.
                                        Why, Jennie?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps," said Jennie, "we want in our ministers enthusiasm more
                                        than wisdom."</p>
            <p>"Enthusiasm," said I. "That might do for the Methodists. But it
                                        does not apply to the Congregationalists, and the
                                        Episcopalians, and the staid and sober Presbyterians."</p>
            <p>"I don't know about that," said Jennie. "What we want of our
                                        preachers is not so much instruction as inspiration. We want
                                        some body not to<pb n="146"/> think
                                        for us but to set us to thinking. Our souls get sluggish,
                                        and they want to be stirred up. I do not want some one to
                                        prove the authority of the ten commandments, John, but some
                                        one to make me more earnest to obey them. I do not care much
                                        about Dr. Argure's learned expositions of the doctrine of
                                        atonement. But I do want some one who shall make me realize
                                        more and more that Jesus died for me."</p>
            <p>"And what has that to do with youth, Jennie?" said I.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," said Jennie, thoughtfully; "unless it is that the
                                        truth seems somehow new and fresh to the young minister.
                                        Besides it is not youth, John, altogether. It is freshness,
                                        and warmth, and enthusiasm, and spiritual life. Mr. Beecher
                                        is not young nor is Spurgeon, nor Dr. Hall, nor Dr. Tyng,
                                        nor John B. Gough. But they are all popular. Father Hyatt
                                        isn't young, John, but I had rather hear him than Dr. Argure
                                        any day."</p>
            <p>I rather think Jennie is right. It is not youth we want at
                                        Wheathedge, but spiritual life and earnestness. At least it
                                        is to be thought of.</p>
            <p>But as to salary—how we are to get a first<pb n="147"/> class man at a third
                                        class salary puzzles me. I shall have to refer that to Mr.
                                        Wheaton. He is the financier of our church I believe.</p>

            <head type="sub">Maurice Mapleson declines to submit to a
                                        competitive examination.</head>
            <p>"I have a letter from Maurice Mapleson," said I to Jennie.</p>
            <p>"What does he say? Will he come?" said she eagerly.</p>
            <p>"No!" said I. "He won't come."</p>
            <p>"I am sorry," said she. "It's too bad of him."</p>
            <p>"You won't think so, my dear," said I, "when you hear his letter.
                                        You'll be more sorry; but you'll think better of him than
                                        you did before."</p>
            <p>We were at the tea-table. It is the rule of our meal hour to have
                                        the conversation one in which the children can
                                        engage—in which at all events they can take an
                                        interest. So the topic was suffered to drop till they were
                                        in bed, and we were alone in the library.</p>
            <p>Maurice Mapleson was a young minister that I thought a good deal
                                        of. So when two Sundays before, Mr. Wheaton suggested him to
                                                me<pb n="149"/> as a
                                        successor to our retiring pastor, I welcomed the suggestion.</p>
            <p>"You know that young Mapleson, don't you Mr. Laicus," said he,
                                        "who preached for us two Sundays last summer. I think he
                                        stopped at your house."</p>
            <p>I assented.</p>
            <p>"I wish you would write him, quite informally you know, to come
                                        down and preach for us a Sunday or two. The folks at our
                                        house were quite taken with him, and I think the people were
                                        generally. I shouldn't wonder if he were the 'coming man,'
                                        Mr. Laicus."</p>
            <p>So that evening I stayed at home from church and wrote to him. I
                                        remembered what Mr. Wheaton had said about this being a
                                        peculiar parish, and our people a peculiar people, and I
                                        waxed eloquent as I wrote. I reminded Mr. Mapleson of our
                                        glorious scenery. I told him we were but a suburb of New
                                        York and he would have a city congregation, and I did not
                                        tell him that he would have to pay very nearly city prices

                                        warmly. In short I considered myself retained as advocate

                     <p>Dear Sir,—I thank you
                                                  very warmly for your kind
                                                  letter of the 6th instant.
                                                  Kind it certainly is, and
                                                  though I must decline the
                                                  invitation it presents so
                                                  cordially to me, I am none
                                                  the less grateful for it,
                                                  notwithstanding the fact
                                                  that it has been a strong
                                                  and not easily resisted
                                                  temptation to violate my
                                                  settled convictions of duty.</p>
                     <p>If I were writing formally to the
                                                  committee it would be enough
                                                  to decline your invitation
                                                  without entering into any
                                                  explanation. But the
                                                  remembrance of the pleasant
                                                  week I spent at your house
                                                  last summer, and the tone of
                                                  your letter, makes me feel
                                                  as though I were<pb n="151"/>
                                                  writing to a personal
                                                  friend. This is my excuse
                                                  (if one is needed) for
                                                  giving you more fully than I
                                                  otherwise should, my reasons
                                                  for declining. Those reasons
                                                  are not in any way connected
                                                  with the parish at
                                                  Wheathedge. I am not
                                                  insensible to the
                                                  attractions which the place
                                                  possesses as a residence,
                                                  nor to that which the parish
                                                  possesses as a field of
                                                  labor. But I resolved when I
                                                  first entered the ministry
                                                  that I would never preach as
                                                  a candidate. I never have,
                                                  and I never will. I began my
                                                  work in a mission school in
                                                  New York City, while I was
                                                  yet in the Seminary. When I
                                                  left the Seminary, Mr.
                                                  Marcus who is one of the
                                                  trustees of the mission
                                                  asked me to come up to this
                                                  church. It is a sort of
                                                  mission among the miners,
                                                  being half supported by Mr.
                                                  Marcus who is one of the
                                                  directors of the Koniwasset
                                                  Coal Co. I came for six
                                                  months. The congregation
                                                  asked me to remain, and I
                                                  remained. And here I purpose
                                                  to remain till God shall
                                                  call me to another field.
                                                  Another field I will not
                                                  seek, though I should live
                                                  and die here. I pretend to
                                                  believe that Christ is my
                                                  Bishop; and I shall not move
                                                  without orders from him.</p>
                     <p>So long as I am pastor here I
                                                  cannot preach with honor as
                                                  a candidate in other
                                                  parishes. I know other
                                                  ministers do
                                                  it—and I do not
                                                  judge them. But I cannot.
                                                  Suppose my people were to
                                                  take advantage of my absence
                                                  for a week to try a
                                                  candidate. I wonder what I
                                                  should<pb n="152"/>
                                                  say to that. And I cannot
                                                  see that settled ministers
                                                  have any more right to try
                                                  other parishes with
                                                  reference to a change of
                                                  place, than parishes with
                                                  settled ministers have to
                                                  try other ministers with
                                                  reference to a change of
                                                  pastors. In a word I do not
                                                  believe in free-love as
                                                  applied to churches.</p>
                     <p>But apart from that I cannot
                                                  preach as a candidate. The
                                                  minister is ordained to
                                                  preach to convert impenitent
                                                  sinners and to build up and
                                                  strengthen Christians. Do
                                                  you suppose I should do
                                                  either if I came to
                                                  Wheathedge on your
                                                  invitation to preach as a
                                                  candidate? Not at all. The
                                                  people would come to
                                                  criticise, and I should go
                                                  to be criticised. They would
                                                  be judges and would expect
                                                  to put me through my
                                                  ministerial faces to try me.
                                                  Come, the congregation says
                                                  in effect to me in such an
                                                  invitation, let us see how

                                                  presumptuous in me to say

                                                  preached but one trial
                                                  sermon—that was
                                                  when I was licensed and I
                                                  never mean to preach
                                                  another.</p>
                     <p>Imagine Paul preaching as a

                                                  Athens or Corinth, and
                                                  submitting his claims as an

                                                  verdict!</p>
                     <p>Or imagine, Mr. Laicus, a client
                                                  coming to you and saying I
                                                  have an important case to be
                                                  tried sir, and I think of
                                                  placing it in your hands.
                                                  Will you oblige me by making
                                                  a neat little speech for me.
                                                  I want to see what kind of a
                                                  speech you can make.</p>
                     <p>Since I wrote that last sentence
                                                  I have read this letter
                                                  over, and have been on the
                                                  point, two or three times,
                                                  of tearing it up and sending
                                                  in its place a simple
                                                  declination. But I feel as
                                                  though I were writing to a
                                                  friend, and it shall go. I
                                                  am sorry it must be so. I
                                                  should like to go to
                                                  Wheathedge. That it is a
                                                  beautiful place, and has
                                                  pleasant people, and is a
                                                  far more important field of
                                                  labor than this I recognize
                                                  fully; and then, what
                                                  possibly influences me quite
                                                  as much, Helen, whom your
                                                  wife knows very well, is
                                                  waiting patiently for me,
                                                  and I am waiting impatiently
                                                  for her, and I never can
                                                  marry on the little pittance
                                                  I receive here. But she is
                                                  of one mind with me in this
                                                  matter, I know, for we have
                                                  often talked it over
                                                  together, and she holds me
                                                  nobly to my resolution. She,
                                                  I am sure, would not have me
                                                  write other than I do.</p>

                                <p>"Well," said Jennie after I had finished reading the letter, "I
                                        believe he is right; but I am sorry John; sorrier than I was
                                        before."</p>
            <p>"Sorry that he won't come, Jennie?"</p>
            <p>"Sorry that he is right," said Jennie. "That is, if he is right."</p>
            <p>"Do you doubt it, Jennie?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Well I don't know, John. I go with him. I like him better for
                                        his letter. I cannot gainsay it. And yet it seems to me that
                                        it puts the ministers in a rather hard position."</p>
            <p>"Yes?" said I interrogatively.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Jennie. "You know perfectly well John that our church
                                        here wouldn't call a man that isn't settled somewhere. The
                                        very fact that he was out of a parish,, would be almost
                                        conclusive against him. And they won't call a man without
                                        trying him. Must Maurice Mapleson live and die in that
                                        little out of the way<pb n="155"/> corner? And if he is ever going to get out of it, how is
                                        it to come about? How does a minister have any chance for a
                                        change if he takes such a ground as that? It's high and
                                        noble John, and I honor him for it; but I am afraid it isn't
                                        practicable."</p>
            <p>"Little woman," said I, "whatever is truly high and noble is
                                        practicable, and you would be the first to tell me so
                                        another time. Don't let our wanting Maurice Mapleson here
                                        blind us to that."</p>
            <p>Jennie smiled her assent. "Well John," said she, "what you
                                                are going to do about it?"</p>
            <p>"Do?" said I. "Nothing. There is nothing to be done, except to
                                        read Mr. Mapleson's letter to the committee, to-morrow night
                                        at our first meeting. And I am curious to see what they'll
                                        say to it."</p>

                                                the pittance they pay him at Koniwasset Corners.

                                                church affairs and I don't think<pb n="158"/> I understand
                                                this business very well. What do you mean by
                                                preaching as a candidate? I thought a candidate was
                                                a man who applied for an office. Am I to understand
                                                that whenever a pulpit is vacant the church expects
                                                different ministers to apply for it, and puts them
                                                on trial, and picks out the one it likes the
                                        best?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Gear.</speaker>
               <p>—You don't really mean to say that any decent
                                                ministers apply for the place on those terms.</p>

               <p>—Indeed they do Mr. Gear. There is never any
                                                lack of candidates for a favorable parish. I have
                                                got half a dozen letters in my pocket now. One man
                                                writes and sends me copies of two or three letters
                                                of recommendation. Another gives me a glowing
                                                account of the revival that has followed his labors
                                                in other fields. Then there's a letter from a
                                                daughter that really moved me a good deal. She
                                                pleads hard for her father who is poor and is
                                                getting old, and needs the salary
                                                sadly—poor man.</p>

                                                of those candidates come to preach I hope you'll
                                                notify me, and I'll stay away.</p>

                                                notions of these young up-start preachers. I reckon
                                                the ways our fathers got their preachers are good
                                                enough for us.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Gear.</speaker>

                                                about Paul's preaching as a candidate, Mr.
                                        Hardcap?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Hardcap.</speaker>
               <p>—Oh! that's different,
                                                altogether—very different. The apostle was
                                                inspired, Mr. Gear.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I notice that this is a very popular style of argument with Mr.
                                        Hardcap. Whenever he is posed in argument his never failing
                                        rejoinder is "Oh! that's different, altogether different."
                                        And I think I have observed that the Hardcap logic is not
                                        confined to Mr. Hardcap, but is in high regard in other
                                        quarters, where I should least look for it.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Gear.</speaker>
               <p>—Well I don't think much of apostolic authority
                                                myself. But I supposed the rest of you thought you
                                                were bound by any precedents Paul had set.</p>

                                                invite one to come from my neighbor and try his hand
                                                for a day while I stand over and watch him. We try
                                                our apprentices that way, but never a good workman.
                                                I go to his shop, inquire as to his character, and
                                                examine the work that he has done. If he has done
                                                good work in another man's shop he will do it well

                                        Gear remarked to me that he wished I would let him know when
                                        we got a parson so that he could come to church again; for
                                        said he, "I have no inclination to serve as a parson
                                        tester." And I confess I am quite of mind with him.</p>

            <head type="sub">Our Christmas at Wheathedge.</head>
            <p>IS there any reason why Episcopalians, Lutherans and Roman
                                        Catholics should have a monopoly of Christmas? Is its
                                        glorious old patron Saint partial? Has the Christ-child no
                                        gifts for us as well as for other folk? Have the December
                                        heavens no brightness—the angel host no song for
                                        "blue Presbyterians?" May we not come to the sacred manger
                                        too? Are our Church festivals so many that we need dread to
                                        add another? Is our religion so inclined to gayety and
                                        money-making that we need curb its joyous tendencies? The
                                        very air of Christmas is marvellous. The heavens are never
                                        so blue, the sun never shines with a profuser generosity.
                                        The very earth clothes itself in the spotless white of the
                                        heavenly robe, as if to prepare for the coming of its Lord.</p>
            <p>Alas for him who does not believe in Christmas! May the ghost of
                                        Scrooge haunt him into a better mind.</p>
            <pb n="165"/>
            <p>This was what I mentally ejaculated to myself last Saturday
                                        afternoon after Mr. Hardcap's protest against our Christmas
                                        celebration.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath morning previous, Miss Moore came to me mysteriously
                                        after church. "I want to walk home with you, Mr. Laicus,"
                                        said she. I have a wife and children, and I felt safe. "I
                                        shall be delighted with the honor," I replied. But Miss
                                        Moore's honors are never empty ones. I knew that she wanted
                                        something; I wondered what. I had not long to wonder; for we
                                        had not crossed the road before she opened the subject.</p>
            <p>"We are going to trim the Church for Christmas," said she, "and
                                        we want you to superintend getting the evergreens."</p>
            <p>"What?" said I, aghast.</p>
            <p>Confidentially, please not mention it, I have been in the habit
                                        for a good many years of taking my wife and my prayer-book
                                        to the Episcopal Church on Christmas-day. Dickens converted
                                        me to its observance ten years or more ago. But none are so
                                        sound as those who are tinged with heresy. And am I not a
                                                "blue<pb n="166"/>
                                        Presbyterian?" It would not do to lend my countenance too
                                        readily to indecorous invasions of the sanctuary with
                                        festivals borrowed from the Roman Catholics. Besides, what
                                        would the elders say? I asked Miss Moore as much.</p>
            <p>"Deacon Goodsole will lend us his pung," was the reply.</p>
            <p>"And the trustees?" said I.</p>
            <p>But Miss Moore never leaves a point unguarded.</p>
            <p>"Young Wheaton is home from school," said she, "and he will go
                                        with you to the woods. He will call to-morrow, right after
                                        breakfast."</p>
            <p>For a difficult piece of generalship give me a woman. Not fitted
                                        for politics! Why, they are born to it. Here was Miss Moore
                                        bent on trimming the church. And lawyer Laicus was to go in
                                        Deacon Goodsole's sleigh with the son of the President of
                                        the Board of Trustees to get the "trimmings." He who dares
                                        to complain after that enlists two dignitaries and one very
                                        respectable layman against him at the outset.</p>
            <p>"Very well," said I, "I will go."</p>
            <p>"Go!" said Miss Moore, "of course you'll go.<pb n="167"/> Nobody doubted that.
                                        But I want to tell you where to go and what to get."</p>
            <p>The next morning I was just finishing my second cup of coffee
                                        when I heard the jingle of bells, and, looking up, saw Jim
                                        Wheaton and the Deacon's sleek horse at my door. So, bidding
                                        Harry, who was to go too, "be quick," an exhortation that
                                        needed no repeating, we were very soon in the pung, armed I
                                        with a hatchet, Harry with a pruning knife.</p>
            <p>That ride was one to be remembered. The air was crisp and clear.
                                        Just snow enough had fallen in the night to cover every
                                        black and noisome thing, as though all nature's sins were
                                        washed away by her Sabbath repentance, and she had commenced
                                        her life afresh. There was luxury in every inhalation of the
                                        pure air. The horse, more impatient than we, could scarcely
                                        wait for leave to go, and needed no word thereafter to
                                        quicken his flying feet. Down the hill, with merry ringing
                                        bells, ever and anon showered with flying snow from the
                                        horse's hoof; through the village street with a nod of
                                        recognition to Deacon Goodsole, who stood at his door to
                                        wave us a cheery recognition; round<pb n="168"/> the corner with a
                                        whirl that threatens to deposit us in the soft snow and
                                        leave the horse with an empty sleigh; across the bridge,
                                        which spans the creek; up, with unabated speed, the little
                                        hill on the other side; across the railroad track, with real
                                        commiseration for the travelers who are trotting up and down
                                        the platform waiting for the train, and must exchange the
                                        joyous freedom of this day for the treadmill of the city,
                                        this air for that smoke and gas, this clean pure mantle of
                                        snow for that fresh accumulation of sooty sloshy filth; pass
                                        the school-house, where the gathering scholars stand,
                                        snowballs in hand, to see us run merily by, one urchin, more mischievous than the
                                        rest, sending a ball whizzing after us; up, up, up the
                                        mountain road, for half a mile, past farm-houses whose
                                        curling smoke tell of great blazing fires within; past ricks
                                        of hay all robed in white, and one ghost of a last summer's
                                        scare-crow watching still, though the corn is long since
                                        in-gathered and the crows have long since flown to warmer
                                        climes; turning off, at last, from the highway into Squire
                                        Wheaton's wood road, where, since the last fall of snow,
                                        nothing has been before us, save a<pb n="169"/> solitary rabbit whose track our dog
                                        Jip follows excitedly, till he is quite out of sight or even
                                        call.</p>
            <p>Here we are at last. And here the evergeens are about us in a profusion which
                                        would make the eyes water of my honest friend the Dutch
                                        grocer who supplied me with my family trees so many years in
                                        New York. Our smoking nag is over his impatience now, and,
                                        being well blanketed, understands what is wanted of him
                                        quite as well as if he were tied, and stands as still as if
                                        he were Squire Slowgoes' fat and lazy "family horse." With
                                        pants tied snugly over our topboots to keep out the
                                        intruding snow, we plunge into the woods. The ringing blows
                                        of our hatchets on the cedar-trees bring down a mimic shower
                                        on our heads and backs. Young Wheaton understands his
                                        business, and shows me how the fairest evergreens are hid
                                        beneath the snow, and what rare forms of crystalline beauty
                                        conceal themselves altogether beneath this white
                                        counterpane. So, sometimes cutting from above and sometimes
                                        grubbing from below, we work an hour or more, till our pung
                                        is filled to its brim. Long before we have finished Jip<pb n="170"/> has returned from
                                        his useless search, and the neighing horse indicates his
                                        impatience to be off again.</p>
            <p>When we got back to the Church we found it warm with a blazing
                                        fire in the great stove, and bright with a bevy of laughing
                                        girls, who emptied our sleigh of its contents almost before
                                        we were aware what had happened, and were impatiently
                                        demanding more. Miss Moore had proposed just to trim the
                                        pulpit—oh! but she is a shrewd
                                        manager—and we had brought evergreens enough to
                                                <emph>make</emph> two or three. But the plans had
                                        grown faster by far than we could work. One young lady had
                                        remarked how beautiful the chandelier would look with an
                                        evergreen wreath; a second had pointed out that there ought
                                        to be large festoons draping the windows; a third, the
                                        soprano, had declared that the choir had as good a right to
                                        trimming as the pulpit; a fourth, a graduate of Mount
                                        Holyoke, had proposed some mottoes, and had agreed to cut
                                        the letters, and Mr. Leacock, the store keeper, had been
                                        foraged on for pasteboard, and an extemporized table
                                        contrived on which to cut and trim them. So<pb n="171"/> off we were driven
                                        again, with barely time to thaw out our half-frozen toes;
                                        and, in short, my half morning's job lengthened out to a
                                        long days hard but joyous work, before the pile of
                                        evergreens in the hall was large enough to supply the
                                        energies of the Christmas workers.</p>
            <p>Of course, we must trim the Sunday school-room as well as the
                                        Church, for the children must have their Christmas; and
                                        trimmed it was, so luxuriantly that it seemed as though the
                                        woods had laid siege to and taken possession of the
                                        sanctuary, and that nature was preparing to join on this
                                        glad day her voice with that of man in singing praise to Him
                                        who brings life to a winter-wrapped earth, and whose fittest
                                        symbol, therefore, is the tree whose greenness not even the
                                        frosts of the coldest winter have power to diminish.</p>
            <p>Of course Christmas itself passed without recognition. I went, as
                                        is my wont, with my wife and my prayer-book, to the
                                        Episcopal Church. Our Christmas waited till Sunday. A
                                        glorious day it was. The sun never shone more brightly. The
                                        crisp keenness was gone from the air. The balmy breath of
                                        spring was in it.<pb n="172"/> The
                                        Church never was so full before and never has been since.
                                        The story of its decorations had been spread far and wide,
                                        and all Wheathedge flocked to see what the Presbyterians
                                        would make of Christmas. The pulpit, the walls, the gallery,
                                        the chandelier were festooned with wreaths of living green.
                                        A cross—O tempora! O
                                        mores!—of cedar and immortelles, stood
                                        on the communion table. Over the pulpit were those sublime
                                        words of the sublimest of all books, "He shall save His
                                        people from their sins." Opposite it, emblazoned on the
                                        gallery, was heaven and earth's fitting response to this
                                        sublime revelation, "Glory be to God on high." Miss Moore
                                        was better than her word. She managed both choir and
                                        minister. Both were in the spirit of the occasion. The
                                        parson never preached a better sermon than his Christmas
                                        meditation. The choir never sung a more joyous song of
                                        praise than their Christmas anthem. And before the influence
                                        of that morning's service I think the last objection to
                                        observing Christmas faded out.</p>
            <p>For there had been some objections. I heard of two.</p>
            <pb n="173"/>
            <p>One came from Mr. Wheaton. Monday afternoon, going by the Church,
                                        he saw the door open, went in, found it full of busy
                                        workers; ceiling, aisles, pulpit, and gallery, strewed with
                                        evergreens, and the clatter of merry voices keeping pace
                                        with the busy fingers. It was his first intimation of what
                                        was going on.</p>
            <p>"Heyday!" said he. "What is all this? Who authorized it, I should
                                        like to know?"</p>
            <p>The chatter of merry voices ceased. The young ladies were in awe.
                                        Miss Moore was not there to answer for them. No one dared
                                        act as spoksman. Young Jim
                                        Wheaton was on a step-ladder rather dangerously resting on
                                        the backs of two pews. He was tacking the letter G to the
                                        gallery. He noticed the silence and discerned the cause.</p>
            <p>"Father," said he, "I wish you would hold this ladder for me a
                                        minute. It is rather ticklish."</p>
            <p>"Ah, Jim, is that you?" said the old man. Pride in Jim is the
                                        father's weak point. The ladder was held. Then his advice
                                        was asked about the placing of the mottoes; and it was
                                        given, and that was the last of Mr. Wheaton's objection.</p>
            <pb n="174"/>
            <p>The other objection came from Mr. Hardcap, the carpenter. I met
                                        him at the door of the church Saturday afternoon, just as
                                        the last rubbish had been swept out and we were closing the
                                        door.</p>
            <p>"Looks beautiful, doesn't it Mr. Hardcap?" said I.</p>
            <p>"They'd better have spent their time on their knees than with
                                        these fixins," growled Mr. Hardcap; "'twould ha' done the
                                        Church more good, a deal sight."</p>
            <p>"Did you spend your time on your knees?" I could not refrain from
                                        asking.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Hardcap did not answer.</p>

            <head type="sub">Mr. Gear Again.</head>
            <p>OUR Bible class at the Mill has prospered greatly. Mr. Gear was
                                        better than his word. The first Sabbath he brought in over a
                                        dozen of his young men; the half dozen who were already in
                                        the Sabbath School joined us of course. Others have
                                        followed. Some of the children of the Mill village gathered
                                        curiously about the school-house door from Sunday to Sunday.
                                        It occurred to me that we might do something with them. I
                                        proposed it to Mr. Gear. He assented. So we invited them in,
                                        got a few discarded singing books from the Wheathedge
                                        Sabbath-school, and used music as an invitation to more.
                                        Mrs. Gear has come in to teach them. There are not over a
                                        dozen or twenty all told as yet. If the skating or the
                                        sliding is good they are reduced to five or six. Still the
                                        number is gradually increasing, and there are enough to
                                        constitute the germ of a<pb n="176"/> possible Mission-school. I wish we had a Pastor. He might
                                        make something out of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear adheres to his pledge, and I to mine. We have no
                                        theological discussions in the class. Occasionally, indeed
                                        pretty frequently, we get on themes on which we are not
                                        agreed. But we never debate. Mr. Gear has made several
                                        attempts at a theological discussion out of the class, but I
                                        have avoided them. I hope he does not think I am afraid of
                                        discussion.</p>
            <p>I am not. But I am convinced that no mere intellectual opinion is
                                        a sin. If Mr. Gear is in darkness it is because he neglects
                                        some known if not some recognized duty. My work is not to
                                        convince him of the error of his opinions. I probably never
                                        could do that. And his opinions are not of much consequence.
                                        My work is to find out what known duty he is neglecting, and
                                        press it home upon his conscience. And so far I have not
                                        discovered what it is. He is one of the most conscientious
                                        men I ever knew. Yet something is wanting in Mr. Gear. I
                                        believe he half thinks so himself. He is mentally restless
                                        and uneasy. He seems to doubt his own doubts, and to want
                                        discussion that he may strengthen<pb n="177"/> himself in his own unbelief. But
                                        still I make no progress. Since that first night I have got
                                        no farther into his heart.</p>
            <p>"John," said Jennie, "I wish you would call and see Mr. Gear. He
                                        has not been in church for six or eight weeks."</p>
            <p>"It is no use," said I, "I have asked him once or twice, and he
                                        always says that he is not coming till we get a Pastor. He
                                        says he does not care to hear candidates; he does not
                                        consider himself a good judge of the article. 'Hardcap,'
                                        says he is a ministerial expert, but I am not."</p>
            <p>"How is he getting on?" said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"To tell the truth, Jennie, I don't know," I replied. "I don't
                                        see that he gets on at all. He seems to be just where he
                                        was."</p>
            <p>Jennie drew a long sigh.</p>
            <p>"Patience, Jennie, patience," said I, "time works wonders."</p>
            <p>"No, John," said Jennie, "time never works. It eats, and
                                        undermines, and rots, and rusts, and destroys. But it never
                                        works. It only gives us an opportunity to work."</p>
            <p>Perhaps Jennie is right. Perhaps we expect<pb n="178"/> time to work for us,
                                        when time is only given us that we may work.</p>
            <p>"Besides," said Jennie, "there is that volume of Theodore
                                        Parker's sermons which you borrowed of him the other day,
                                        you have never returned it."</p>
            <p>No! And I had never read it. Our theme in Bible class had touched
                                        on prayer. After the class Mr. Gear had tried to get me into
                                        a theological discussion about prayer. I had been silent as
                                        to my own views, but had asked him for his. And he had
                                        handed me this volume in reply. It contained a sermon by
                                        Theodore Parker on the subject which Mr. Gear said expressed
                                        his own views exactly. Jennie's remark brought this volume
                                        to mind, I took it down from the shelf, opened to the
                                        sermon, and read it aloud to Jennie.</p>
            <p>We both agreed that it was a good sermon, or rather, to speak
                                        more accurately, a sermon in which there was good. It is
                                        true that in it Mr. Parker inveighed against the orthodox
                                        philosophy of prayer; he denied that God could really be
                                        influenced or his plans changed. But on the duty of prayer
                                        he vehemently insisted.<pb n="179"/> Mere philanthropy and humanity, he
                                        said, are not religion. There must also be piety. The soul
                                        must live in the divine presence; must inhale the Spirit of
                                        God; must utter its contrition, its weaknesses, its wants,
                                        and its thanks-givings to its Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>That evening's reading suggested a thought to me. The next
                                        evening I started for Mr. Gear's to try if it were time, and
                                        to try the practicability of the plan it had developed in my
                                        mind. Mr. Gear welcomed me cordially. Mrs. Gear went off
                                        almost immediately on pretence of putting the children to
                                        bed, and left us two alone together. I opened the
                                        conversation by handing her husband the volume of sermons
                                        and thanking him for it.</p>
            <p>"What do you think of the sermon?" said he.</p>
            <p>"I liked a great deal of it very much indeed," said I. "I believe
                                        you told me that you liked it."</p>
            <p>"Very much," said he. "I think its one of Theodore Parker's
                                        ablest sermons."</p>
            <p>"And you believe in it?" said I interrogatively.</p>
            <p>"With all my heart," said he. "Who can believe that the Great
                                        Infinite First Cause can<pb n="180"/> be influenced, and his plans changed by the teasing of
                                        every one of his insignificant little creatures?"</p>
            <p>"But the rest of the sermon," said I. "Do you believe that?"</p>
            <p>Last Sunday Professor Strait preached for us. He preached against
                                        what he called humanitarianism. He said it was living
                                        without God; that there was very little difference between
                                        ignoring God and denying his existence, and that the
                                        humanitarians practically ignored him; that they believe
                                        only in men.</p>
            <p>"It is not true," said Mr. Gear, somewhat bitterly. "You can see
                                        for yourself that it is not true. Theodore Parker believes
                                        in prayer as much as Professor Strait. I don't believe but
                                        that he prayed as much."</p>
            <p>"And you agree with him?" said I, with a little affectation of
                                        surprise.</p>
            <p>"Agree with him, Mr. Laicus!" said he, "of course I do. There can
                                        be no true religion without prayer, without piety, without
                                        gratitude to God, without faith in Him. Your Church has not
                                        the monopoly of faith in God, by any means, that it assumes
                                        to have."</p>
            <pb n="181"/>
            <p>"And you really believe in prayer?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Believe in prayer? Why, of course I do. Do you take me for a
                                        heathen?" replied he, with some irritation.</p>
            <p>"And every night," said I, "you kneel down and commend yourself
                                        to our Heavenly Father's protection? and every morning you
                                        thank him for His watchfulness, and beseech divine strength
                                        from Him to meet the temptations of the day; and every day
                                        you gather your family about His throne, that you may teach
                                        your children to love and reverence the Father you delight
                                        to worship?"</p>
            <p>There was a long pause. Mr. Gear was evidently taken by surprise.
                                        He made no answer; I pressed my advantage.</p>
            <p>"How is it, my friend?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Well, n— no!" said he, "I can't honestly say that I
                                        do."</p>
            <p>"You believe in prayer, and yet never pray," said I, "is that
                                        it?"</p>
            <p>"It is so much a matter of mere habit, Mr. Laicus," said he,
                                        excusingly; "and I never was trained to pray."</p>
            <p>"All your lifelong," said I, taking no heed of<pb n="182"/> the excuse, "you
                                        have been receiving the goodness of God, and you never have
                                        had the courtesy to say so much as 'thank you.' All your
                                        lifelong you have been trespassing against Him, and never
                                        have begged his pardon, never asked his forgiveness. Is it
                                        so?"</p>
            <p>There was a moment's pause. Then he turned on me almost fiercely.</p>
            <p>"How can I thank him Mr. Laicus," said he "when you say that I do
                                        not love him, and cannot love him."</p>
            <p>"Did I ever say that you do not love God?" said I gently.</p>
            <p>"Well then," said Mr. Gear, "I say it. There is no use in beating
                                        about the bush. I say it. I honor him, and revere him, and
                                        try to obey him, but I do not particularly love him. I do
                                        not know much about him. I do not feel toward him as I want
                                        my children to feel toward me. What would you have me do Mr.
                                        Laicus? Would you have me play the hypocrite? God has got
                                        flatterers enough. I do not care to swell their number."</p>
            <p>"I would have you honest with him as you are with me," I replied.
                                        "I would have you kneel<pb n="183"/> down, and tell him what you have
                                        told me; tell him that you do not know him, and ask him that
                                        you may; tell him that you do not love him and ask him that
                                        you may."</p>
            <p>"You orthodox people," said he, "say that no man can come to God
                                        with an unregenerate heart; and mine is an unregenerate
                                        heart. At least I suppose so. I have been told so often
                                        enough. You tell us that no man can come that has not been
                                        convicted and converted. I have never suffered conviction or
                                        experienced conversion. I cannot cry out to God, "God be
                                        merciful to me a sinner." For I don't believe I am a sinner.
                                        I don't pretend to be perfect. I get out of temper now and
                                        then. I am hard on my children sometimes, was on Willie
                                        to-night, poorly fellow. I even rip out an oath
                                        occasionally. I am sorry for that habit and mean to get the
                                        better of it yet. But I can't make a great pretence of
                                        sorrow that I do not experience."</p>
            <p>"You have lived," said I, "for over thirty years the constant
                                        recipient of God's mercies and loving kindnesses, and never
                                        paid him the poor courtesy of a thank you. You have
                                        trespassed on his patience and his love in ways<pb n="184"/> innumerable through
                                        all these thirty years, and never said so much as I beg
                                        pardon. And now you can look back upon it all and feel no
                                        sorrow. I am sorry if it is so, Mr. Gear. But if it is, it
                                        need not keep you from your God. You can be at least as
                                        frank with him as you have been with me. You can tell him of
                                        your indifference if you can not tell him of your penitence
                                        or your love."</p>
            <p>There was a pause.</p>
            <p>"You believe in prayer," I continued. "You are indignant that I
                                        suspected you of disbelief; and yet you never pray. Are you
                                        not living without God; is it not true of you that 'God is
                                        not in all your thoughts?'"</p>
            <p>He was silent.</p>
            <p>"Will you turn over a new leaf in your lifebook?" said I. "Will
                                        you commence this night a life of prayer?"</p>
            <p>He shook his head very slightly, almost imperceptibly. "I will
                                        make no promises," said he. But still he spoke more to
                                        himself than to me.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Gear," said I, "is it not evident that it is no use for you
                                        and me to discuss theology? It is not a difference of
                                        doctrine that separates<pb n="185"/> us. Here is a fundamental duty; you
                                        acknowledge it, you assert its importance, but you have
                                        never performed it; and now that your attention is called to
                                        it you will not even promise to fulfil it in the future."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Laicus," said he, "I will think of it. Perhaps you are
                                        right. I have always meant to do my duty, if my duty was
                                        made clear. Perhaps I have failed, failed possibly in a
                                        point of prime importance. I do not know. I am in a maze. I
                                        believe there is a knowledge of God that I do not possess, a
                                        love of God that I do not experience. I believe in it
                                        because I believe in you M. Laicus, and yet more because I
                                        believe in my wife. But may be it will come in time. Time
                                        works wonders."</p>
            <p>My very words to Jennie. And Jennie's answer was mine to him.</p>
            <p>"Time never works Mr. Gear. It eats, and undermines, and rots,
                                        and rusts, and destroys. But it never works. It only gives
                                        us an opportunity to work."</p>
            <p>And so I came away.</p>

            <head type="sub">Wanted—A Pastor.</head>
            <p>WE are in a sorry condition here at Wheathedge. The prospects
                                        are, that it will be worse before it is better. For weeks
                                        now (it seems like a year or two) we have been without the
                                        Gospel. I do not mean that literally the preaching of the
                                        Gospel has been dispensed with. On the contrary, I have
                                        heard more sermons on the text, "I am determined to know
                                        nothing among you save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified,"
                                        than I ever heard before in my life. We are hearing
                                        candidates, and every candidate seems to feel it necessary
                                        to declare himself, to propound a sort of religious
                                        platform. The sermons seem to me to have about as much
                                        relation, as a general thing, to the spiritual condition of
                                        the hearers as Gov. Hoffman's last message to the real
                                        interests of the people of the State. In fact, if the truth
                                        were told, it is not a sermon we want, but a platform. We
                                        invite the candidate to preach, not that we may profit by
                                        the Gospel,<pb n="187"/> but that
                                        he may show us his face. It has become a psychological
                                        curiosity to see how many different sermons can be evolved
                                        from that one text. I wonder sometimes if St. Paul would
                                        know himself in his modern attire.</p>
            <p>I am very glad that Maurice Mapleson did not accept my invitation
                                        to come to Wheathedge, to preach as a candidate. For
                                        listening to a candidate and listening to the Gospel are two
                                        very different things. The candidate preaches to show us how
                                        he can do it. We listen to hear how he can do it. From the
                                        moment he enters the pulpit all eyes are fixed upon him. His
                                        congregation is all attention. Let him not flatter himself.
                                        It is as critics, not as sinners, that we listen. We turn
                                        round to see how he walks up the aisle. Is his wife so
                                        unfortunate as to accompany him? We analyze her bonnet, her
                                        dress, her features, her figure. If not, he monopolizes all
                                        attention. In five minutes we can, any of us—there
                                        are a few rare exceptions—tell you the cut of his
                                        coat, the character of his cravat, the shape of his collar,
                                        the way he wears his hair. If he has any peculiar pulpit
                                        habit, woe betide him; he is odd. If he has not, woe betide
                                        him; he is commonplace<pb n="188"/> and conventional. He rises to invoke the blessing of God.
                                        If he goes to the throne of God he goes alone. We go no
                                        farther than the pulpit. We tell one another afterwards that
                                        he is eloquent in prayer, or that his prayers are very
                                        common. If his style is solemn, we condemn him as stilted.
                                        If it is conversational, we condemn him as too colloquial
                                        and familiar. He reads a hymn. We compare his elocution with
                                        that of our own favorites, or with some imaginary ideal, if
                                        we have no favorites. He preaches. We can, any of us, tell
                                        you <emph>how</emph> he does it. But <emph>what</emph> he
                                        says, there are not half a dozen who can tell. Does he tell
                                        us of our sins? We do not look at our own hearts, but at his
                                        picture, to see if it is painted well. Does he hold before
                                        us the cross? We do not bow before it. We ask, is it well
                                        carved and draped? The Judgment is only a dramatic poem; the
                                        Crucifixion only a tableau.</p>
            <p>So, though we have preaching, we have no Gospel at Wheathedge.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the lack of the parish is quite as painfully felt in
                                        other departments as in the pulpit. The Church is without a
                                        head. It flounders about like a headless chicken; excuse<pb n="189"/> the homely
                                        simile, which has nothing but truth to commend it. When Mrs.
                                        Beale died last week, we had to send to Wheatensville to get
                                        a minister to attend the funeral. When Sallie D. was married
                                        she sent there, too, for a minister. He was out of town, and
                                        the ceremony came near being delayed a week for want of him.
                                        The prayer-meeting lags. Little coldnesses between church
                                        members break out into open quarrels. There is no one to
                                        weld the dissevered members. Poor old Mother Lang, who has
                                        not left her bed for five years, laments bitterly her loss,
                                        and asks me every time I call to see her, "When
                                        <emph>will</emph> you get a pastor?" The Young People's
                                        Association begins to droop. Even the Sunday-school shows
                                        signs of friction, though Deacon Goodsole succeeds in
                                        keeping it in tolerably good running order by his
                                        imperturbable good humor. One advantage we have gained by
                                        this interregnum—only one. Even Mr. Hardcap
                                        is convinced that pastoral labors are not so unimportant as
                                        he had imagined.</p>
            <p>For myself, I am in despair. I made no very serious objection to
                                        being put on the supply committee. I fancied the task a
                                        comparatively easy<pb n="190"/> one. I
                                        had understood that there was no lack of ministers wanting
                                        places. There is none. We have applications three or four
                                        deep, of all sorts and kinds, from parishless clergymen. But
                                        such a jury as the Wheathedge congregation affords, I never
                                        saw and hope never to see again. I only wish there was some
                                        law to treat them as other juries are treated: shut them up
                                        in the jury-room till they agree on a verdict.</p>
            <p>The first minister was too old; he would not suit the young
                                        folks. The second, just out of the seminary, was too young;
                                        the old folks said he had not experience. The third had
                                        experience. He had been in a parish three years. He was
                                        still young, with the elastic hopes and strong enthusiasm of
                                        youth. But he was a bachelor. The people pretty universally
                                        declared that the minister should have a wife and a house.
                                        The women all said there must be somebody to organize the
                                        sewing circles, and to lead the female prayer-meetings. The
                                        fourth was married, but he had three or four children. We
                                        could not support him. The fifth was a most learned man, who
                                        told us the original Greek or Hebrew of his texts, and,
                                        morning or<pb n="191"/> evening,
                                        never came nearer to America than Rome under Augustus
                                        Cæsar. He was dull. The sixth afforded us a most
                                        brilliant pyrotechnic display. He spluttered, and fizzed,
                                        and banged, as though Fourth of July himself had taken
                                        orders and gone to preaching. The young people were carried
                                        away. But the old folks all said he was sensational.</p>
            <p>Then, besides those we have heard, there are several we have
                                        talked about. There is the Rev. Mr. C——
                                        who has the reputation of being a most excellent pastor. He
                                        is indefatigable in visiting the sick, in comforting the
                                        afflicted, in dealing with the recreant and the unconverted.
                                        But Mr. Wheaton says emphatically he will never do for our
                                        people. "He is no preacher, Mr. Laicus," says he; "and our
                                        people demand first-rate preaching. We must have a man that
                                        can draw."</p>
            <p>We talked over Mr. K——. He is a rare
                                        preacher, by all accounts. I understand that his health has
                                        suffered somewhat by excessive study, and he would like
                                        another parish, a quieter one, where he can have more time
                                        to his study, and can use his old sermons. He <orig>preach-</orig>
               <pb n="192"/> ed once or twice in
                                        exchange with our old pastor before he left. But Solomon
                                        Hardcap would not hear of him, and even Deacon Goodsole
                                        shook his head at his suggestion, "He is not social," said
                                        the Deacon. "He does not know half the people in Highkrik,
                                        where he has been settled for over five years. He often
                                        passes his best friend without noticing him, on the street."
                                        "Never would do," says Mr. Hardcap. "He only visits his
                                        people once a year. I want to <emph>know</emph> my minister.
                                        We want a man who will run in and out as though he cared for
                                        us. Preaching is all very well, but we don't want a minister
                                        who is all talk."</p>
            <p>I am in despair. And despite the breach of ecclesiastical
                                        etiquette, I have resolved to resort to advertising. I have
                                        not submitted my advertisement to the other members of the
                                        committee, but I am sure that it is in accord with the
                                        general feelings of the Church.</p>
            <p>"Jennie, what do you think of my sending this advertisement to

            <head type="sub">Our Prayer-Meeting.</head>
            <p>ONE thing we have gained by losing our pastor—the
                                        promise of better prayer-meetings.</p>
            <p>Not that he was recreant in his duty. He performed it only too
                                        well. We learned to depend on him. He suffered us to do so.
                                        It was only by a delicate irony that the prayer-meeting
                                        could be termed one of the "social meetings" of the Church.
                                        A solemn stillness pervaded the room. No one ever spoke
                                        after he entered the awful presence, unless he rose,
                                        formally addressed "the chair," and delivered himself of a
                                        set address. Occasionally one bolder than the rest spoke in
                                        a sepulchral whisper to his neighbor—that was all.
                                        In other social meetings the ladies, according to my
                                        observation, bear their full burden of conversation. In our
                                        prayer-meetings no woman ever ventured to open her mouth. In
                                        fact, I hardly know why they were called <orig>prayer-</orig>
               <pb n="195"/> meetings. We rarely had
                                        any greater number of prayers than in our usual Sabbath
                                        service. Yes, I think we usually had one more.</p>
            <p>The minister entered solemnly at the appointed hour, walked
                                        straight to his desk, without a word, a bow, a smile of
                                        recognition; read a long hymn, offered a very respectable
                                        imitation of the "long prayer," gave out a second hymn, and
                                        called on an elder to pray, who always imitated the
                                        imitation, and included in his broad sympathies all that his
                                        pastor had just prayed for—the Church, the
                                        Sabbath-school, the unconverted, backsliders, those in
                                        affliction, the President and all those in authority, the
                                        (Presbyterian) bishops and other clergy, not forgetting the
                                        heathen and the Jews. Then followed a passage of Scripture
                                        for a text from the pastor, with a short sermon thereafter.
                                        Nor was it always short. I fancied he felt the necessity of
                                        occupying the time. It was not unfrequently long enough for
                                        a very respectable discourse, if length gives the discourse
                                        its respectability. Then we had another prayer from another
                                        layman, and then the invariable announcement, "the meeting
                                        is now open," and the invariable<pb n="196"/> result, a long, dead
                                        pause. In fact, the meeting would not open. Like an oyster,
                                        it remained pertinaciously shut. Occasionally some good
                                        elder would rise to break the painful silence, by repeating
                                        some thought from the previous Sunday's sermon, or by
                                        telling some incident or some idea which he had seen in a
                                        previous number of "The Christian Union." But as we had all
                                        been to church, and as most of us take "The Christian
                                        Union," this did not add much to the interest of the
                                        meeting. Generally another prayer and hymn, sometimes two,
                                        sufficed to fill the hour. The pastor kept his eye on the
                                        clock. When the hand pointed to nine he rose for the
                                        benediction. And never did a crowd of imprisoned schoolboys
                                        show more glad exultation at their release than was
                                        generally indicated by these brethren and sisters when the
                                        words of benediction dismissed them from their period of
                                        irksome restraint. Every man, and every woman, too, found a
                                        tongue. We broke up into little knots. A busy hum of many
                                        voices replaced the dead silence. The "social meeting"
                                        commenced when the "prayer-meeting" ended. This, I think, is
                                        a fair <orig>por-</orig>
               <pb n="197"/> traiture of our
                                        prayer-meetings at Wheathedge as they were during our late
                                        pastor's presence with us.</p>
            <p>The fault was not his—at least it was only proximately
                                        his. He felt the burden, groaned under it, tried hard, poor
                                        man! to remedy the evil. He often came to consult me about
                                        it. He tried various plans. He gave a course of weekly
                                        lectures. The prayer-meeting was less a meeting of prayer
                                        than before. No man was willing to follow his elaborate
                                        lecture with a fragmentary talk. He announced from the
                                        pulpit, the preceding Sabbath, the topic for the next
                                        meeting. Worse and worse! A few members conscientiously
                                        studied up the passage in "Barnes's Notes" and the
                                        "Comprehensive Commentary," and brought us the result of
                                        their investigations in discourse powerfully prosy, and
                                        recondite with second hand learning. The Minister at last
                                        gave up the matter in despair. I think the condition of our
                                        prayer-meetings was one consideration which greatly
                                        influenced him in deciding to leave.</p>
            <p>I thought that there was nothing left in them to be lost, that no
                                        change could be other than<pb n="198"/> for the better; but after he went what little meeting we
                                        had fell away. The few who had been attracted by his
                                        personal presence ceased to come. In vain we endeavored to
                                        revive our flagging spirits by continually reminding one
                                        another that the promise was to two or three gathered
                                        together. That was our standard text. Every leader referred
                                        to it in his prayers, and generally in his opening remarks.
                                        We had need of it. For the last two weeks there were not
                                        members enough present to serve as pall-bearers for the dead
                                        prayer-meeting.</p>
            <p>This brought about a crisis. Two weeks ago, Deacon Goodsole came
                                        to me to talk over the spiritual condition of our church. I
                                        agreed with him that the prayer-meeting was a fatal symptom
                                        if not a fatal disease. We agreed to do what we could to
                                        remedy it. We asked the session to put it into our hands.
                                        They were only too glad to do so. We spoke quietly to two
                                        other of the brethren to co-operate with us. We divided the
                                        parish among ourselves, and undertook to visit all the
                                        praying and waking members—not a very onerous
                                        task. We talked with one by one, concerning the spiritual
                                                <orig>condi-</orig>
               <pb n="199"/> tion of the church,
                                        asked them to come next week to the prayer-meeting, and to
                                        bring with them warm hearts. "Come," we said, "from your
                                        closets. Come in the spirit of prayer." Fifteen minutes
                                        before the hour of meeting we four met in the Bible-class
                                        room. One agreed to act that night as leader. It was Deacon
                                        Goodsole. He told the rest of us his subject. Then we all
                                        knelt together and asked God's blessing on our
                                        prayer-meeting. From that brief and simple conference we
                                        went together to the conference-room. Each one agreed to
                                        carry some offering with him—a word, a prayer, a
                                        hymn. Each one agreed also to bring in speech but a single
                                        thought, and in prayer but a single petition. The leader
                                        himself should occupy but five minutes. Our hearts were
                                        aglow. We never had such a prayer-meeting in Wheathedge.
                                        Deacon Goodsole did not have to announce that the
                                        prayer-meeting was open. It opened itself. We had hard work
                                        to close it. The meeting last week was preceded in the same
                                        manner by fifteen minutes of prayer. It was characterized by
                                        the same warmth and freshness. We are astonished to find how
                                        short our hour is when we come to the<pb n="200"/> meeting from our
                                        knees, when we bring to it, in our hearts, the spirit of
                                        God. We have no long speeches. So far we have had few
                                        exhortations and much true experience. Shall we fall back
                                        again into the old ruts? Perhaps. It is something that we
                                        are not in them now. Meanwhile, from this brief experience I
                                        cull five proverbs for my own reflection.</p>

            <head>We are Jilted.</head>
            <p>WHEATHEDGE is in a fever of excitement—not very
                                        agreeable excitement. Disappointment and anger are curiously
                                        commingled. Little knots of men and women gathered after
                                        church on Sunday in excited discussion. A by-stander might
                                        overhear in these conferences such phrases dropped as
                                        "Shameful." "It's too bad." "If he is that sort of man it's
                                        very fortunate we did not get him." "I have no faith in
                                        ministers," and the like. Do you ask what is the matter? We
                                        have been jilted.</p>
            <p>I will not give names, at least not the true ones. For I have no
                                        inclination to involve myself in a newspaper controversy,
                                        and none to injure the prospects of a young man who
                                        possesses qualities which fit him for abundant usefulness if
                                        vanity and thoughtlessness do not make shipwreck of him.</p>
            <p>For six months now we have been without a<pb n="202"/> pastor. We are hard
                                        to suit. Mr. Wheaton was right. Wheathedge is a peculiar
                                        place, and requires a very peculiar man. But about six weeks
                                        ago there came along a very peculiar man. He seemed to be
                                        just adapted to the place. He was fresh from the seminary.
                                        He had a wife but no children. He was full of enthusiasm. As
                                        a preacher he was free from conventionalism, bright,
                                        sparkling, brilliant; more brilliant than warm. In private
                                        life he was social, genial, unministerial. Old Aunt Sue did
                                        indeed complain that when he called there he did not offer
                                        to pray with her. And good old Father Haines said he wished
                                        that there was less poetry and more Christ in his sermons.
                                        But neither old Aunt Sue nor old Father Haines contribute
                                        much to the support of the Church, and their criticisms did
                                        nothing to abate the general enthusiasm. Jim Wheaton said he
                                        was just the man, and promised to double his subscription,
                                        if necessary, to get him. Deacon Goodsole was scarcely less
                                        enthusiastic. I do not think there was a dissenting voice
                                        among the ladies; and the young folks were absolutely
                                        unanimous.</p>
            <pb n="203"/>
            <p>"If we can only get Mr. Uncannon," said Jim Wheaton to me one
                                        morning, as we rode to the city in the cars together, "in
                                        three weeks we will drain the Methodist church dry of its
                                        young folks."</p>
            <p>Personally, I have no taste for foraging in other men's fields.
                                        But I knew that Jim Wheaton would not appreciate my
                                        sentiments, and so I kept silence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Uncannon preached for us two Sabbaths. He spent the
                                        intervening week in Wheathedge. He visited with Deacon
                                        Goodsole most of the leading families. He stopped at Mr.
                                        Wheaton's. If the people had been charmed with him in pulpit
                                        they were delighted with him in the parlor. The second
                                        Sabbath I do not think there would have been a dissenting
                                        voice to the call.</p>
            <p>There was only one difficulty. It was considered very doubtful if
                                        we could get him. That doubt I undertook to solve.</p>
            <p>Monday he returned to the city. I went down in the same train,
                                        and took occasion to fall into conversation with him. I told
                                        him frankly the state of feeling. I represented that it was
                                                very<pb n="204"/>
                                        desirable that the matter should go no further unless there
                                        was a prospect that he would consider favorably a call if it
                                        were given him. He replied with equal frankness. He said
                                        that he was delighted with the place and with the people. He
                                        wanted to come. There was only one obstacle. He understood
                                        that we paid our former pastor only $1,200 a year. He could
                                        not undertake to live on that.</p>
            <p>"In fact," said he, "they want me very much at North Bizzy, in
                                        Connecticut. They pay there $1,500 a year. It is a
                                        manufacturing town. I do not think either the society or the
                                        work would be as congenial as in Wheathedge. I like the
                                        quiet of your rural parish. I appreciate the advantages it
                                        would afford me for study. But $300 is a good deal of money.
                                        I do not want to be mercenary, Mr. Laicus, but I do not want
                                        to be pinched."</p>
            <p>I assured him that no such difficulty should stand in his way.
                                        When I returned, I found he had expressed the same
                                        sentiments to Deacon Goodsole and Mr. Wheaton. We were all
                                        agreed that we would do as well as North Bizzy. So we gave
                                        him a call at $1,500. Possibly we <orig>pre-</orig>
               <pb n="205"/>
                                        sumed too much; but we generally considered it as good as
                                        settled.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath after the call he came to Wheathedge. This time he
                                        brought his young wife with him. The ladies were more
                                        charmed than ever. All Wheathedge turned out to see and hear
                                        our new minister. He remained over to our weekly
                                        prayer-meeting. It was astonishing what a spirit of devotion
                                        was awakened in our church. I have never seen the
                                        prayer-meeting so fully attended. He seemed fully to
                                        reciprocate our enthusiasm. He and his wife were tireless in
                                        the praises of the beauties of Wheathedge. "It is just the
                                        place," said Mrs. Uncannon, "in which I should choose to
                                        spend my days." Of course this saying was repeated all over
                                        the parish, and this evidence of her appreciative taste
                                        increased very measurably her own and her husband's
                                        popularity.</p>
            <p>He went away Thursday morning without giving a final and definite
                                        answer. Deacon Goodsole indeed asked him point blank for
                                        one. He replied that though his mind was about made up,
                                        still he felt that so solemn a connection ought not to be
                                        made without a prayerful<pb n="206"/> consideration. This was all very proper. We waited, with
                                        patience, till this decorous delay should be over. But we
                                        already considered him our pastor.</p>
            <p>It was the next week that Deacon Goodsole came into my house one
                                        evening, in a state of great excitement. He had an open
                                        letter in his hand. "Look there," said he. "The Church at
                                        North Bizzy is trying to get our minister away from us."</p>
            <p>The letter was from Mr. Uncannon. It was to the effect that the
                                        Church at North Bizzy were taking measures to secure a
                                        parsonage. He preferred to come to Wheathedge, but he did
                                        not know what he should do for a house. There had been, he
                                        believed, some talk of building a parsonage at Wheathedge.
                                        He felt very desirous to take his bride to her
                                        "home"—not to depend on boarding-houses or
                                        landlords. If this could be provided he thought it would
                                        settle the question; for both he and his wife infinitely
                                        preferred the clear air and sunny skies, and grand old
                                        mountains, and glorious river basking in the golden
                                        sunlight, &amp;c., &amp;c., to the dust and soot and
                                        noise of man's busy but dirty industry.</p>
            <pb n="207"/>
            <p>"Very well," said I. "I do not care to bid against the Church at
                                        North Bizzy. But I have always wanted a parsonage at
                                        Wheathedge. I will be one of five to pay the rent for this
                                        year, and one of ten to build one next year."</p>
            <p>Deacon Goodsole started a subscription paper on the spot. In a
                                        few days we had secured a house for the year, and money
                                        enough to make our building operation certain. The Deacon
                                        wrote Mr. Uncannon accordingly. We expected his answer
                                        forthwith, and his arrival soon after. Wheathedge was at
                                        last satisfied.</p>
            <p>Imagine, then, if you can, the chagrin and disappointment which
                                        was caused when, last Sunday morning, a letter was read from
                                        Mr. Uncannon to Mr. James Wheaton, Chairman of the Board of
                                        Trustees, declining the call. Mr. Uncannon had given it his
                                        most prayerful consideration. He was deeply moved by the
                                        warm welcome which had been accorded to him. He had hoped
                                        that the Lord would make it plain that it was to be his
                                        privilege to cast in his lot with us. But the Lord had
                                        ordered it otherwise. The Providential indications seemed to
                                        him clear that it was his duty to labor in another field.</p>
            <pb n="208"/>
            <p>But he united his prayers with ours that the Great Bishop would
                                        soon send us a pastor who should feed us with the bread of
                                        life.</p>
            <p>Deacon Goodsole says that the Providential indications are a
                                        salary of $1,800 and a parsonage; and Mr. Wheaton says if
                                        any other young man succeeds in playing us off against a
                                        rival parish he is mistaken; that's all. Even gentle Jennie
                                        is indignant. "Of all flirtation, ministerial flirtation
                                        seems to me to be the worse," she says; and truth to tell,
                                        she never had much patience with any other.</p>
            <p>I do not want to judge Mr. Uncannon too harshly. In fact I am not
                                        in a very judicial frame of mind. But, whatever his intent,
                                        his ministerial coquetry has injured the cause of Christ in
                                        Wheathedge more than a year of preaching can benefit it in
                                        North Bizzy. Meanwhile, the parsonage, which we hired, lies
                                        vacant on our hands, and waits for an occupant.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
            <head type="sub">We propose.</head>
            <p>WE are in the valley of humiliation. Since the church has been
                                        rejected, it has an opportunity to understand how a
                                        candidate feels when he is rejected. I am inclined on
                                        consideration to recall the last paragraph of the last
                                        chapter. I am inclined to think Mr. Uncannon may prove a
                                        "means of grace" to us yet. He has certainly been a thorn in
                                        the side.</p>
            <p>On further consideration, I do retract it. I here emphatically
                                        record that first thoughts are not always best thoughts, and
                                        that it is my sober second judgment that Mr. Uncannon has
                                        done us more good than he has the parish at North Bizzy. We
                                        gave him to them grudgingly. But it has been a case in which
                                        the proverb applies: It is more blessed to give than to
                                        receive. For Mr. Uncannon's flirtation has probably given us
                                        Maurice Mapleson for a pastor.</p>
            <pb n="210"/>
            <p>Two weeks ago I was coming up from New York on the train. Deacon
                                        Goodsole was in the seat in front of me. My satchel was my
                                        only traveling companion. And I, according to custom, was
                                        enjoying a train nap, when I was aroused by a hand on my
                                        shoulder coupled with a hearty "Hallo! you could not be
                                        sounder asleep if you were in church and Dr. Argure was in
                                        the pulpit."</p>
            <p>It was Mr. Wheaton.</p>
            <p>"Good afternoon," said I. "Sit down." And my satchel exchanged
                                        its seat for a place in my lap in order to make room for Mr.
                                        Wheaton on the seat beside me.</p>
            <p>"Look here, gentlemen," said Mr. Wheaton, taking the proffered
                                        seat, "we've been fooling about this minister business long
                                        enough."</p>
            <p>"Been fooled you mean," said Deacon Goodsole.</p>
            <p>"I tell you," said Mr. Wheaton, slapping his knee by way of
                                        emphasis, "that young Maurice Mapleson is the man for us.
                                        The more I think of it the more I am sure of it."</p>
            <p>"He is a right earnest man," said the Deacon. "I think he was the
                                        first spark we have seen in<pb n="211"/> the ashes of our prayer meeting for
                                        many a day."</p>
            <p>"Can't you get him to come down, Mr. Laicus?" asked Mr. Wheaton.</p>
            <p>I shook my head resolutely.</p>
            <p>"Not as a candidate you know, but on some dodge or other. Invite
                                        him to spend a week with you, and book on to him for the
                                        pulpit when Sunday comes."</p>
            <p>"He isn't the man for dodges," said the Deacon, doubtfully.</p>
            <p>I shook my head as decidedly to the second proposition as to the
                                        first.</p>
            <p>"Well then," said Mr. Wheaton, "if he won't come here we will
                                        have to go there. It isn't far."</p>
            <p>The Deacon doubted whether the church would agree to deviate from
                                        the old paths.</p>
            <p>"They wouldn't have done it," said Mr. Wheaton. "But they'll
                                        agree to anything now I think."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Gear recommended that plan when we first met," said I. "He
                                        will approve of it. But how as to Mr. Hardcap?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! no matter about Hardcap," said Mr. Wheaton, "he's no
                                        account."</p>
            <pb n="212"/>
            <p>"Excuse me," said I, "he is one of our committee and is of
                                        account."</p>
            <p>So after some consultation it was finally agreed that we should
                                        get off at the Mill Village Station to see Mr. Gear, and
                                        then walk up to Wheathedge. Deacon Goodsole also proposed to
                                        put Mr. Hardcap on the special committee to go to Koniwasset
                                        Corners, and Mr. Wheaton said he would furnish a free pass
                                        over the road to all who would go. No man is impervious to
                                        compliments if they are delicately administered. At all
                                        events Mr. Gear was sensibly pleased by having us call on
                                        him in a body. And Mr. Hardcap, when he found that the new
                                        plan involved a free ride on the railroad and a Sunday
                                        excursion for himself, withdrew all objections.</p>
            <p>My wife says, "For shame, John," and wants me to strike that last
                                        sentence out. But it is true, and I do not know why it
                                        should not stand. It is in confidence you know.</p>
            <p>The next Saturday Mr. Wheaton, Mr. Hardcap and Deacon Goodsole
                                        started for Koniwasset Corners. They reached it, or rather
                                        they reached Koniwasset, the nearest point, Saturday
                                        evening, and Sunday morning rode over, a drive of five<pb n="213"/> miles. It was a
                                        beautiful day; the congregation turned out well; the little
                                        church was full, and Maurice, unconscious of the presence of
                                        a committee, and preaching, not to fish for a place, but to
                                        fish for men, was free, unconstrained and, as Providence
                                        willed it, or as good fortune would have it (the reader may
                                        have his choice of expressions, according as he is Christian
                                        or heathen), was in a good mood. Deacon Goodsole was
                                        delighted. Jim Wheaton was scarcely less so, and even Mr.
                                        Hardcap was pleased to say that it was "a real plain Gospel
                                        sermon." Deacon Goodsole found an old friend in one of the
                                        congregation and went home with him to dinner, while Mr.
                                        Wheaton and Mr. Hardcap went back to the hotel. Deacon
                                        Goodsole joined them in the evening and brought a good
                                        report of the Sunday-school, where he had watched the
                                        unconscious parson (who superintends his own school), and
                                        had even, to avoid suspicion, taken the place of an absent
                                        teacher for the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton had to return the next day, but the Deacon found no
                                        great difficulty in persuading Mr. Hardcap to stay over, and
                                        Tuesday evening they went to the weekly prayer-meeting.<pb n="214"/> Meanwhile they
                                        inquired quietly in the neighborhood about the preacher at
                                        the Corners, giving however no one a hint of their object,
                                        except the parson at Koniwasset who commended Maurice very
                                        highly for his piety and his efficiency. As to his
                                        preaching, he said he should not call him eloquent, "but" he
                                        added, "there is one thing; Maurice Mapleson never speaks
                                        without having something to say; and he is very much in
                                        earnest."</p>
            <p>Both the Deacon and Mr. Hardcap were very much pleased with the
                                        spirit of the prayer-meeting—the Deacon said Mr.
                                        Mapleson could make more of a fire with less fuel than any
                                        man he knew—and when the committee made their
                                        report, which they did at the close of our Wednesday evening
                                        meeting, it was unanimous in favor of giving Maurice a call.</p>
            <p>To call a man without hearing him was not the orthodox way, and
                                        the objections which Mr. Hardcap had originally proposed in
                                        the committee meeting were renewed by others. In reply it
                                        was said, very truly, that the church really knew more about
                                        Mr. Mapleson than they could possibly learn from a trial
                                        sermon, or even<pb n="215"/> from
                                        half a dozen of them, that a careful investigation by a
                                        committee into his actual working power was a far better
                                        test than any pulpit exhibition, however brillant. I added that
                                        Mapleson's letter was positive, and his convictions settled,
                                        and that I felt reasonably certain he would not preach as a
                                        candidate. On the whole this increased the desire to get
                                        him; and finally a second committee was appointed to go and
                                        hear him. A couple of ladies were put, informally, on this
                                        committee, and the church paid the expenses of the four. I
                                        say informally. Deacon Goodsole nominated Miss Moore and
                                        Mrs. Biskit, and quoted the case of Phoebe from the
                                        sixteenth chapter of Romans to prove that it was apostolic.
                                        But the ladies shook their heads, as did some of the elders
                                        of the church and Mr. Hardcap entered a vigorous protest.
                                        The Deacon was a born and bred Congregationalist, and is
                                        radical, I am afraid, in church matters. A compromise was
                                        finally effected by appointing two of the elders, who agreed
                                        to take their wives.</p>
            <p>They came back as well pleased as the first committee had been,
                                        and the result was, to make a long story short, that last
                                        week a unanimous<pb n="216"/> call
                                        was sent to Maurice, and as I write this letter I have
                                        before me a private note from him, saying that he has
                                        received it, and that, if agreeable to us, he will come down
                                        and spend a week with me. He says he wants to see our
                                        prayer-meeting, our Sabbath-school teachers' meeting, and
                                        our Sabbath-school. He adds that he will preach for us on
                                        Sunday if we desire, but that he does not want it known that
                                        he will be here at the prayer-meeting, as he wants to take a
                                        back seat and see how it goes.</p>
            <p>In short he gives me to understand that it is the church which is
                                        on trial, not the minister, and that whether he comes or not
                                        depends on what kind of a church he finds it to be. This
                                        reversal of the ordinary course of things is a little queer;
                                        but I guess it is all right. At all events it will not do
                                        the church at Wheathedge any harm. Meanwhile until we get a
                                        final answer from Maurice Mapleson our pulpit is no longer
                                        in the market. For after our experience of ministerial
                                        coquetry I do not think there will be any inclination on our
                                        part for a flirtation.</p>

            <p>"MR. Wheaton," said I, "we made a queer blunder the other night;
                                        we did not settle on any salary when we made out our call to
                                        Mr. Mapleson."</p>
            <p>"No blunder," said Mr. Wheaton, "I left it out on purpose. I
                                        thought may be we could get him for less than fifteen
                                        hundred dollars. What do you think? Wouldn't he come on
                                        twelve hundred, and the parsonage?" And Mr. Wheaton smiled
                                        on me with an air of self-satisfaction which seemed to say,
                                        'Jim Wheaton is the man to manage church business.'</p>
            <p>I confess I was indignant at the idea of driving a sharp bargain
                                        with a minister, but I rather suspect Jim Wheaton never
                                        makes any other than a sharp bargain.</p>
            <p>"Not with my advice," said I. "I told him the church ought to pay
                                        fifteen hundred a year and a parsonage, and I presumed it
                                        would. But I recommend him not to come till he knows."</p>
            <pb n="218"/>
            <p>We were in the Post Office, waiting for the distribution of the
                                        evening mail. Mr. Hardcap was one of our group. So was
                                        Deacon Goodsole. It was indeed a sort of extemporized and
                                        unintentional meeting of our supply committee, only Mr. Gear
                                        being absent.</p>
            <p>"The church won't give mor'n 1,200 with my advice," said Mr.
                                        Hardcap decidedly. "And that's mor'n I make. I would just
                                        like to contract my time for the year at four dollars a day.
                                        And I have to get up at six and work till sunset, ten hours,
                                        hard work. I don't see why the parson should have half as
                                        much again for five or six hours' work. I have heard our old
                                        pastor say myself that he never allowed himself to study
                                        mor'n six hours a day."</p>
            <p>"But the pastoral work, Mr. Hardcap?" said I. "You make no
                                        account of that."</p>
            <p>"The calls, do you mean?" said he. "Well, I should like to be
                                        paid four dollars a day for just dressin' up in my best and
                                        visitin', that's all."</p>
            <p>"Not only the calls," said I, "though you would find calling
                                        anything but recreation, if it was your business. But there
                                        are the <orig>prayer-</orig>
               <pb n="219"/> meetings, and
                                        the Sabbath-school, and the whole management and direction
                                        of the church."</p>
            <p>"Prayer-meetin' and Sabbath-school!" replied Mr. Hardcap; "don't
                                        we all work in them? And we don't ask any salary for it. I
                                        guess it ain't no harder for the parson to go to
                                        prayer-meetin' than for me."</p>
            <p>I shrugged my shoulders. The deacon interposed.</p>
            <p>"I agree with you, Mr. Laicus," said he. "We have got to pay a
                                        good salary. I wish we could make it two thousand a year
                                        instead of fifteen hundred."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap opened his eyes and pursed his mouth firmly together,
                                        as though he would say 'Do my ears deceive me?'</p>
            <p>"But," continued the deacon, "there is something in what Mr.
                                        Hardcap says. There are half-a-dozen farmers in our
                                        Wheathedge congregation who don't handle fifteen hundred
                                        dollars in money from one year's end to the other. Mr.
                                        Hardcap isn't the only man to whom it seems a big sum to
                                        pay. Mr. Lapstone the shoemaker, Mrs. Croily the seamstress,
                                        Joe Hodgkins the blacksmith, and half-a-dozen<pb n="220"/> others I could name,
                                        have to live on less. And you must remember their incomes,
                                        Mr. Laicus, as well as yours, and mine, and Mr. Wheaton's
                                        here."</p>
            <p>"Well, gentlemen," said Mr. Wheaton, "we've got to pay a good
                                        salary, but I think we ought to keep expenses down all we
                                        can."</p>
            <p>"I don't believe in makin' preachin' a money makin' business
                                        no-how," said Mr. Hardcap. "Parsons hain't got no business
                                        to be a layin' up of earthly riches, and fifteen hundred
                                        dollars is a good deal of money to spend on bread and
                                        butter, now I tell you."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Hardcap," said I, "what do your tools cost you?"</p>
            <p>"My tools?" said he. "Yes," said I, "your tools. What do they
                                        cost you?"</p>
            <p>"Well," said he, "they range all the way from ten cents up to
                                        five dollars, accordin' to the article and its quality."</p>
            <p>"Did you ever consider," said I, "what a minister's tools cost?"</p>
            <p>"Minister's tools!" said he, "I didn't know he had any, except
                                        his pen."</p>
            <pb n="221"/>
            <p>"My dear sir," said I, "his tools alone cost him between one and
                                        two hundred dollars a year."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap expressed his incredulity by a long whistle; and even
                                        Deacon Goodsole expressed a quiet doubt. But my father was a
                                        minister and I know something about it.</p><p>"Look here," said I. "He must have at least two religious
                                        weeklies, one of his own denomination, and one of a more
                                        general character," and I took out a pencil and paper and
                                        noted down my list as I made it, "that's six dollars. He
                                        ought to have at least two of the popular magazines, that's
                                        eight dollars. He ought to have a good scientific magazine
                                        of some kind, four dollars more; and his theological
                                        quarterly is indispensable, four dollars more; and at least
                                        one of the daily newspapers, he ought really to read on both

            <p>"That's what it will cost him," said I, "simply to keep up with
                                        the times."</p>
            <p>The other gentlemen looked at my figures a moment in silence.
                                        Deacon Goodsole was the first to speak. "That is a pretty
                                        liberal estimate," said he. "A great many ministers get
                                        along on less than that."</p>
            <p>"Oh yes," said I, "and grow dry and dull in consequence. Little
                                        food makes lean men."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap shook his head resolutely, "I don't believe in
                                        preachin' to the times," said he. "It's scripter
                                        interpretation and the doctrines we want."</p>
            <p>"Very well," said I, "the tools for that work cost more yet.
                                        Yours cost you from ten cents to five dollars, his from five
                                        dollars to a hundred. A single volume of Lange, or Alford,
                                        or the Speaker's Commentary cost five dollars; a good Bible
                                        Dictionary, from twenty to thirty; a good Encyclopedia, from
                                        fifty to a hundred. And theological treaties have a small
                                        market and therefore a high price—very high for
                                        their value. And his tools grow old too, and have to be
                                        replaced oftener than yours do, Mr. Hardcap."</p>
            <p>"I don't see that, Mr. Laicus," said he. "A<pb n="223"/> book, if you keep it
                                        careful, will last a great many years. I am reading out of a
                                        Bible that belonged to my grandfather. And I expect 'll
                                        belong to my grandson yet."</p>
            <p>"My dear Mr. Hardcap," said I, "the leaves and covers and printed
                                        works do not make the book. Ideas make the book. You can use
                                        your tools over and over again. If your plane gets dull out
                                        comes the hones and the dulled edge is quickly sharpened
                                        again. But ideas are gone when they are used."</p>
            <p>"I don't see it," said Mr. Hardcap. And I do not suppose he does.
                                        I wonder if he knows what an idea is.</p>
            <p>"It is so," continued I, "with all student-tools. There are a few
                                        which the minister uses over and over again; his
                                        dictionaries, commentaries, and cyclopedia, if he has one.
                                        There are a few treaties that are worth reading and
                                        re-reading; but they are exceptional. Generally the student
                                        gets the gist of a book in one reading, as a squirrel the
                                        kernel of a nut at one crack. What remains on his shelves
                                        thereafter is only a shell. A book that has been dulled can
                                        rarely be sharpened and put to use again. There is no<pb n="224"/> ministerial hone.
                                        The parson must replenish his bench every year. At least he
                                        ought to."</p>
            <p>"I haven't no great opinion of larned ministers no-how," said Mr.
                                        Hardcap. "It isn't larnin' we want, Mr. Laicus. It is the
                                        Gospel, the pure, unadulterated Gospel."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap was incorrigible. I might as well try to explain to a
                                        North American Indian the cost and the value of a modern
                                        cotton mill as the cost and the value of student tools to
                                        Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>But I believe I produced some impression on the others. Deacon
                                        Goodsole still pondered my figures. "I never thought of the
                                        cost of minister's tool before," said he. "It's quite an
                                        item."</p>
            <p>"Well," said Mr. Hardcap, "for my part I don't see why the parson
                                        can't live on a thousand dollars a year as well as I can."</p>
            <p>I had failed to produce conviction on the subject of tools. I
                                        resolved to try another tack. "What do you pay for help?"
                                        said I.</p>
            <p>"Help?" said he interrogatively.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said I. "What do you pay your cook and chambermaid?"</p>
            <pb n="225"/>
            <p>"Hoh!" said he contemptuously. "I don't keep no help. My Bible
                                        tells me that God made the wife to be a help-meet for man,
                                        and my wife is all the help I want. I wouldn't have a
                                        servant round my house at no price."</p>
            <p>"Do you suppose our pastor and his wife can get along the same
                                        way?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"Don't see why not," said he sententiously.</p>
            <p>"What!" said Mr. Wheaton. "Would you have your pastor's wife do
                                        her own work, Mr. Hardcap? I hope we haven't got so poor as
                                        that. She must be a lady, Mr. Hardcap; a lady, sir."</p>
            <p>"Well," said Mr. Hardcap, "and can't a lady do her own work? High
                                        and mighty notions these that a woman must eat the bread of
                                        idleness to be a lady."</p>
            <p>"Oh! it's all very well, Mr. Hardcap," said Mr. Wheaton; "but our
                                        pastor's wife has a position to maintain. She owes a duty to
                                        the parish, sir. She can't be maid of all work at home. I
                                        should be ashamed of the church to suffer it."</p>
            <p>"There certainly is a difference, Mr. Hardcap," said the Deacon.
                                        "Mrs. Hardcap may do her own washing. And if anybody finds
                                        her over the washtub Monday morning no one thinks the<pb n="226"/> worse of her for it.
                                        But it really wouldn't do for our pastor's wife."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap shook his head resolutely. "I don't see it," said he.
                                        "I don't believe a minister's wife is too good to work."</p>
            <p>"She isn't," said the Deacon. "But if she washes Monday, and
                                        irons Tuesday, and sweeps Wednesday, and bakes Thursday, and
                                        sews Friday and Saturday, what time has she left to make
                                        calls or receive them?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap only shrugged his shoulders.</p>
            <p>"How many calls does your wife make in a year?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"Oh! we don't make no calls," said Mr. Hardcap. "We've got other
                                        work to do."</p>
            <p>"And yet you expect your minister and his wife to call on you?"
                                        said I interrogatively.</p>
            <p>"I s'pose so," said he.</p>
            <p>"I remember hearing you say that you thought it rather hard of
                                        Mrs. Work, just before they left, that she hadn't been
                                        inside of your house for six months. How many calls do you
                                        suppose Mrs. Mapleson would have to make in a year in order
                                        to call on every family once in six months?"</p>
            <pb n="227"/>
            <p>"Don't know," said Mr. Hardcap, shortly.</p>
            <p>"Well," said the Deacon, "we've got over a hundred families in
                                        our parish. It would take nearly one call every day."</p>
            <p>"Beside extra calls on the sick," I continued. "You will either
                                        have to give Mrs. Mapleson a servant or relinquish your
                                        expectation of receiving any calls from her; that is very
                                        evident."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap made no reply.</p>
            <p>"There are one or two other items that ought to be considered in
                                        deciding what the pastor's salary should be," said a gentle
                                        but tremulous voice at my side. I turned about to see the
                                        speaker. It was old Father Hyatt, who had joined our group,
                                        unperceived.</p>
            <p>"I suppose Mr. Hardcap's best broadcloth coat and Mrs. Hardcap's
                                        black silk gown last them a good many years. Isn't it so,
                                        Mr. Hardcap?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap confessed that it was.</p>
            <p>"The minister has to wear broadcloth, Mr. Hardcap, all the week.
                                        He must be always in society dress. So must his wife. With
                                        the utmost economy their bill for clothes mounts up to a
                                        frightful sum. I know, for I have tried it."</p>
            <pb n="228"/>
            <p>"There is something in that," said Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>Old Father Hyatt is a great favorite with Mr. Hardcap, as indeed
                                        he is with all of us. And no one ever accused Father Hyatt
                                        of extravagance.</p>
            <p>"I know a city clergyman," continued the old man, "who always
                                        preaches in a silk gown, though he is a Congregationalist.
                                        'It saves my coat', said he to me once in explanation. 'I
                                        can wear a seedy coat in the pulpit and no one is the
                                        wiser.' 'But,' said I, 'how about the silk gown?' 'Oh!' said
                                        he, 'the ladies furnish the gown.'"</p>
            <p>We laughed at the parson's shrewdness. Even Mr. Hardcap smiled.</p>
            <p>"And there are some other items, too, gentlemen," added Father
                                        Hyatt, "which I hope you will consider. The churches don't
                                        ordinarily know about them. At least they do not consider
                                        them. The company item alone is an enormous one. Not once in
                                        six months now do I have a friend to pass the night with me.
                                        But when I was settled here my spare room always had a
                                        guest, and half the time my stable an extra horse. Every
                                        benevolent agent, every traveling minister, every canvasser
                                        makes straight for the<pb n="229"/> minister's house. He has to keep an inn for the benefit
                                        of the parish, and gets no pay for it."</p>
            <p>"Cut them off," said Mr. Hardcap. But he said it good naturedly.</p>
            <p>"'Given to hospitality,' says the Apostle," replied Father Hyatt.</p>
            <p>"Well," said Deacon Goodsole, with a sigh, "we ought to pay the
                                        fifteen hundred a year. It's none too much. But I don't see
                                        where it's coming from."</p>
            <p>"Oh! never you fear," said Mr. Wheaton. "Mr. Mapleson is worth
                                        fifteen hundred, and we'll have to pay it. We'll get it
                                        somehow. Write him it's fifteen hundred, Mr. Laicus. You'll
                                        be safe enough."</p>
            <p>With which our informal conference came to an end. But I have not
                                        written. I wonder if Jim Wheaton runs the Koniwasset Coal
                                        Company, and the Newtown railroad, and the Wheathedge bank
                                        on the "somehow" principle. I wish had asked him. I am glad

            <head type="sub">Ecclesiastical Financiering.</head>
            <p>BUT though I have no stock in the Koniwasset Coal Company or the
                                        Newtown railroad or the Wheathedge Bank, I have some in the
                                        Calvary Presbyterian Church, and I decidedly object on
                                        consideration to carry on that institution on the "somehow"
                                        principle. So I intimated as much to Mr. Wheaton the other
                                        day, after thinking the whole matter over, and taking
                                        counsel with Jennie about it.</p>
            <p>"Oh! go ahead," said Mr. Wheaton. "Tell him we'll pay him $1,500
                                        and a parsonage. The church will back you, Mr. Laicus."</p>
            <p>"And if the church don't," said I, "will you pay the deficit?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton shook his head, very decidedly. I was equally decided
                                        that without a responsible backer I would not "go ahead." So
                                        on my demand a meeting of the Board of Trustees was called.
                                        The Supply Committee met with them.<pb n="231"/> James Wheaton, Esq., Chairman of the
                                        Board of Trustees, was in the chair.</p>
            <p>On behalf of the Supply Committee I stated the object for which
                                        the Board was convened. The church had hitherto paid $1,200
                                        salary. It was quite inadequate. No one doubted that. It was
                                        unreasonable to expect that Maurice Mapleson would come for
                                        less than we had offered Mr. Uncannon—$1,500 a
                                        year and a parsonage. But in the call, by a strange
                                        omission, the church had neglected to mention any salary.
                                        The Committee wished to write Mr. Mapleson on the subject.
                                        Would the Board sustain us in pledging the church to $1,500
                                        and the parsonage?</p>
            <p>Upon this there was an informal expression of opinion all round
                                        the Board. Mr. Wheaton led the way. He had no doubt on the
                                        subject. We must have a minister, a good minister, a live,
                                        wide-awake, practical man. Such men were in demand. If one
                                        could not be got for $1,200, we must pay $1,500. That was
                                        the way in which he managed railroads; and business was
                                        business, whether in church or railroad. Not pretending to
                                        be a saint, he naturally took a<pb n="232"/> worldly view of the
                                        matter; but he at least tried to conduct worldly matters on
                                        equitable principles. It was certainly true that the laborer
                                        was worthy of his hire.</p>
            <p>So, in substance, said James Wheaton, Esq., Chairman Board of
                                        Trustees, etc., etc.; and so, in substance, said they all.
                                        Even Mr. Hardcap acquiesced, though with a mild protest
                                        against modern extravagance.</p>
            <p>"Well, gentlemen," said Mr. Wheaton, "this is just what I
                                        expected; yes, let me say, just what I was sure of. In fact,
                                        I told Mr. Laicus he might depend on having $1,500 a year;
                                        but he was not satisfied with my assurance—he
                                        wanted yours. I hope he is satisfied."</p>
            <p>"Excuse me," said I, "if I seem unreasonable, but I am not
                                        satisfied; and I should certainly have been so with Mr.
                                        Wheaton's assurance. I never doubted that he was good for
                                        $1,500 a year. But, in dealing with a church board, to be
                                        frank, I want to know where the money is coming from. Pray,
                                        Mr. Treasurer, what was our income last year?</p>
            <p>The Treasurer murmured something about not having his accounts.</p>
            <pb n="233"/>
            <p>"In round numbers," said I.</p>
            <p>"Between fourteen and fifteen hundred dollars."</p>
            <p>"And our expenses?"</p>
            <p>"Not far from eighteen hundred dollars."</p>
            <p>"And, pray, how," continued I, "was the deficit made up?"</p>
            <p>A part, it appears, was made up by a special subscription, and a
                                        part is still due as floating debt, and part went in to
                                        increase the mortgage. Perhaps I would remember the meeting
                                        in the fall at Mr. Wheaton's house.</p>
            <p>I did remember it very well. But I was anxious that the other
                                        gentlemen should not forget it.</p>
            <p>"And now, gentlemen," said I, "you propose to add three hundred
                                        dollars to that annual deficit. Where is the money to come
                                        from?"</p>
            <p>There was a momentary silence. The question was evidently a new
                                        one. Apparently not a member of the Board had considered it.
                                        At length one gentleman suggested that we must raise the pew
                                        rents. This brought an indignant protest from Deacon
                                        Goodsole, who is a strong advocate of the free-pew system.</p>
            <pb n="234"/>
            <p>"Never," said he, "with my consent. Any pew-rent is bad enough.
                                        Trafficking in the Gospel is abominable at best. It shuts
                                        out the poor. Worse than that, it shuts out the godless, the
                                        irreligious, the profane—the very men we want to
                                        catch. The pew-rents are too high now. We must not raise
                                        them."</p>
            <p>The Treasurer also added a mild protest. The pew-holders would
                                        not stand it.</p>
            <p>"What do you say, Mr. Wheaton?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Say?" said he: "why, I say you cannot carry on a church on the
                                        same principles on which you carry on a railroad or a bank.
                                        It is a different affair altogether. You must trust the Lord
                                        for something. I think that we can safely trust Him to the
                                        amount of three hundred dollars at least. Where's your
                                        faith?"</p>
            <p>"Making false promises and trusting the Lord to fulfil them isn't
                                        faith," said Deacon Goodsole.</p>
            <p>"I say, Jim," said Mr. Jowett, "you trust Him for your interest
                                        money—that will set us all right."</p>
            <p>There was a little laugh at this suggestion. Mr. Wheaton holds a
                                        mortgage on the church.<pb n="235"/> He did not take kindly to this
                                        practical application of the doctrine of faith.</p>
            <p>"Oh! well," said he, "we can raise it somehow. Never fear. A good
                                        minister will fill up our empty pews. Then in the summer we
                                        must manage to bleed the boarders a little more freely. It
                                        won't hurt them. What with a concert, or fair, or a
                                        subscription, or a little extra effort our plate
                                        collections, we can manage it, I have no doubt."</p>
            <p>"For my part," said I, "I agree with one the gentlemen, who told
                                        us early in this discussion that we must carry on church
                                        affairs on business principles. I don't see any business
                                        principles in agreeing to pay money which we have not got
                                        and don't know where to get."</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Jowett, "Mr. Laicus is right. The
                                        shamefully loose ways in which our Protestant churches carry
                                        on their finances is a disgrace to the Christian religion."</p>
            <p>Mr. Jowett is a broker. He assured me after the meeting that it
                                        was almost impossible to get a loan on church property
                                        because churches were so notoriously slack in paying their
                                        interest.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap murmured an assent. "I don't<pb n="236"/> b'lieve, gentlemen,
                                        in agreein' to pay what we hain't got. If we'd got the
                                        $1,500, I'd say give it to him. I don't grudge him the
                                        money. But I don't want this church to make no promises that
                                        it aint' a goin' to keep."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Hardcap has had some experience with promise-breaking
                                        churches," said Deacon Goodsole.</p>
            <p>It seems that Mr. Hardcap did the carpenter work in some repairs
                                        on the Methodist church here last summer. When he got
                                        through he carried in his bill to the President of the Board
                                        of Trustees. The President referred him to the Treasurer.
                                        The Treasurer reported no funds and referred him to the
                                        Chairman of the Building Committee. The Chairman of the
                                        Building Committee explained that it was his business to
                                        supervise the building, not to raise the funds, and sent him
                                        back to the President. It was not till Mr. Hardcap, whose
                                        stock of patience is small, threatened the church with a
                                        mechanic's lien that the remedy was forthcoming.</p>
            <p>"Well, gentlemen," said I, "I will not be a party to getting a
                                        minister here on—excuse the term,—false
                                        pretences; on the assurance that we<pb n="237"/> can pay him $1,500 a year when it is
                                        a hard matter to pay him $1,200. There are ten of us here. I
                                        will put my name down now for $30, if the rest will do the
                                        same. If the Lord sends the $300, or if the ladies raise it
                                        by a fair, or if Mr. Wheaton gets up a concert, or the
                                        summer boarders come to our rescue, we shall have nothing to
                                        pay. If none of these things happen, the minister will not
                                        have it all to lose."</p>
            <p>The matter was eventually settled in that way. We raised a
                                        contingent fund of $250 then and there, which we have since
                                        made up to $400. So that now we can offer $1,500 a year with
                                        a clear conscience.</p>
            <p>As a lawyer I have had some experience dealing with corporations.
                                        And I record my deliberate conviction here that of all
                                        corporations church corporations are financially the worst;
                                        the most loose and dilatory and unconsciously dishonest. I
                                        record it as my deliberate conviction, having had some
                                        opportunities for knowing, that in the Calvinistic church,
                                        of the others I don't pretend to know anything, on the
                                        average not one half the ministry get their meagre salaries
                                                promptly.<pb n="238"/> This
                                        injustice is the greatest and most scandalous feature in the
                                        treatment to which the churches subject their ministers.
                                        That ministers are subjected to hardships is a matter of no
                                        consequence. So are other people. It is the injustice, the
                                        absolute and indefensible <emph>injustice</emph>, the
                                        promising to pay their meagre salaries and then not paying
                                        even those—the obtaining of their services under
                                        false pretences—that I complain of. If I were a
                                        minister I never would accept a call without knowing
                                        thoroughly the income and the expenditure of the church.</p>
            <p>As I write there lies before me a letter from my late pastor. He
                                        wants to borrow $300 for a few weeks. His Board of Trustees
                                        are thus much behind-hand in the first quarter's payment. He
                                        has not the means to pay his rent. The duty of the Board in
                                        such a case is very evident. The very least they can do is
                                        to share in providing temporarily for the exigency. The very
                                        most which a mean Board could do would be to ask the
                                        minister to unite with them in paying up the deficiency. In
                                        fact, he who is least able to do it has to carry it all.
                                        Nobody else will trust the church. He has to trust it for
                                                hundreds<pb n="239"/> of
                                        dollars. And then when his grocer and his landlord and his
                                        tailor go unpaid, men shrug their shoulders and say,
                                        pityingly, "Oh! he's a minister, he is not trained to
                                        business habits." And the world looks on in wonder and in
                                        silent contempt to see the Christian Church carrying on its
                                        business in a manner the flagrant dishonesty of which would
                                        close the doors of any bank, deprive any insurance company
                                        of its charter, and drive any broker in Wall street from the
                                        Brokers' Board.</p>
            <p>Jennie says this last is pretty sharp writing; and she shakes her
                                        head over it. But it is time, and I decline to cancel
                                it.</p>

            <head type="sub">Our Donation Party—by Jane Laicus.</head>
            <p>MY husband wants me to write an account of the donation we gave
                                        our new minister. He wants it to put in his book.</p>
            <p>"Why, John," said I, "I can't write anything for a book. I never
                                        wrote anything for print in my life. You mustn't think I am
                                        clever because you are."</p>
            <p>"My dear Jennie," said he, "there is no magic in print. Write
                                        just such an account as you wrote your mother. If you had
                                        that letter you could not do better than give me that to put
                                        in."</p>
            <p>"I can't possibly write, John. I would indeed if I could."</p>
            <p>"Then," said John, "it can't go in at all. For I was not here. I
                                        cannot describe it."</p>
            <p>He was so earnest about it I finally had to yield. He says I
                                        always have my own way. I didn't this time I am sure. There
                                        is only one thing that reconciles me to it. I do not
                                                believe<pb n="241"/> the
                                        publishers will print it. I told John I wouldn't trust my
                                        writing to his judgment. I wouldn't you know, of course
                                        because he would be sure to say it was good. So we agreed to
                                        leave it to the publishers. If they don't like this chapter
                                        they are going to leave it out. John is going to leave them
                                        to read the proof, and we shan't either of us know till the
                                        book is published whether "our donation party" gets in or
                                        not. I confess to a little hope it will get in.</p>
            <p>Let me see how it happened. Oh! this was the way: Maurice was at
                                        our house the Sunday he supplied our pulpit. He told my
                                        husband that he thought he should accept our call. But he
                                        said he didn't think the parsonage would do him any good. He
                                        wanted to go to housekeeping, but he had not the money to
                                        furnish it with, and he would not run in debt.</p>
            <p>That set me thinking. I talked the matter over with Miss Moore
                                        and found she was quite of my mind; and the week after, we
                                        got Maurice's letter accepting the call, we proposed to the
                                        ladies at the sewing society to undertake to furnish the
                                        parsonage. The idea took at once. In fact the having a
                                        parsonage is a new thing at<pb n="242"/> Wheathedge, and we feel a little pride in having it
                                        respectable, you know; at least so as not to be a disgrace
                                        to the church. Mrs. Goodsole thought it doubtful about
                                        raising the money, and Mrs. Hardcap said that "her husband
                                        wasn't in favor of the parsonage nohow, and she didn't
                                        believe would think much of fixin' of it up;" but Miss Moore
                                        replied to Mrs. Goodsole that she could try at any rate, and
                                        to Mrs. Hardcap that she would be responsible that Mr.
                                        Hardcap would do his share; a remark which to some of us
                                        seemed a bold one, but which pleased Mrs. Hardcap for all
                                        that.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap, I believe, means well, though to some of us his
                                        ideas do seem very contracted, sometimes. But my husband
                                        says that narrow men are needed as well as broad ones, and
                                        that if there were no Mr. Hardcap to count the cost of every
                                        venture before it was undertaken, the church would have been
                                        bankrupt long before this time.</p>
            <p>We appointed committees that evening; one to raise the
                                        money—of course Miss Moore was at the head of
                                        that—one to furnish the kitchen, one to furnish
                                        the parlor and bed-room, (as I<pb n="243"/> knew the bride, I was put on that
                                        committee,) and one to provide a supper. Some of the ladies
                                        wanted to have a grand reception. They said it would be a
                                        good thing to surprise the new pastor with a house-warming.
                                        Mrs. Hardcap proposed that the sewing society meet there
                                        that afternoon. But Miss Moore objected strongly. She said
                                        it would cost nearly as much to provide a supper for the
                                        whole congregation as to furnish a good bed-room set. I
                                        think, though, it was really little Miss Flidgett who put a
                                        quietus on that plan.</p>
            <p>"Why," said she in an injured tone, "I want to be there and see
                                        how they like it."</p>
            <p>Nobody dared advocate the plan after that speech. I really think
                                        that they all felt very much the same way, however.</p>
            <p>The next day some of us met at the parsonage to take a survey.
                                        Last year the house was without a tenant, and it had come to
                                        be in rather a dilapidated condition. The fence gate was off
                                        the hinges. The garden was over-grown with weeds. The sink
                                        in the kitchen was badly rotted. One of the parlor blinds
                                        was off. There was a bad leak over the back porch, and
                                                the<pb n="244"/>
                                        plastering looked just ready to fall, and the whole looked
                                        dingy,-it needed outside painting sadly.</p>
            <p>"We needn't let these things go so," said Miss Moore. "The
                                        landlord must put the house to rights."</p>
            <p>So off we posted to the landlord, who is a queer, crusty old
                                        bachelor, who has, I verily believe, a kind heart, and does
                                        a good deal of good in his own fashion; but his fashion is
                                        never like any one else's. Not a thing could Miss Moore get
                                        out of him. He had rented the house as it stood, he said. If
                                        the trustees didn't like it they needn't have taken it. They
                                        paid little enough rent to repair it themselves. He had
                                        nothing more to do except to get his rent regularly, and
                                        that she might depend he would do.</p>
            <p>Miss Moore returned somewhat disappointed, but nothing daunted.
                                        "So much the better," said she. "It will give Mr. Hardcap a
                                        chance to do something."</p>
            <p>"How about the painting?" said Mrs. Wheaton. "It ought to be
                                        painted."</p>
            <p>Miss Moore shook her head. "So it ought,"<pb n="245"/> she said, "and so I told Mr. Quirk;
                                        but he won't do anything,—and we can't afford to
                                        paint it; we shouldn't have money left for furnishing."</p>
            <p>So we took the measure of the floors for the carpets, settled on
                                        what furniture we would get, and adjourned.</p>
            <p>Next week I went down to New York and called on the young lady to
                                        whom Maurice is engaged. Her home is in New York, or rather
                                        it was there; for to my thinking a wife's home is always
                                        with her husband; and I never like to hear a wife talking of
                                        "going home" as though home could be anywhere else than
                                        where her husband and her children are. Maurice and Helen
                                        were to be married two weeks from the following Friday, for
                                        Maurice proposed to postpone their wedding trip till his
                                        next summer's vacation; and Helen, like the dear, sensible
                                        girl she is, very readily agreed to that plan. In fact I
                                        believe she proposed it. She had some shopping to do before
                                        the wedding, and I had some to do on my own account, and we
                                        went together. I invented a plan of refurnishing my parlor.
                                        I am afraid I told some fibs, or at least came dreadfully
                                                near<pb n="246"/> it. I
                                        told Helen I wanted her to help me select the carpet; and
                                        though she had no time to spare, she was very good-natured,
                                        and did spare the time. We ladies had agreed—not
                                        without some dissent—to get a Brussels for the
                                        parlor, as the cheapest in the end, and I made Helen select
                                        her own pattern, without any suspicion of what she was
                                        doing, and incidentally got her taste on other carpets, too,
                                        so that really she selected them herself without knowing it.
                                        Deacon Goodsole recommended me to go for furniture to Mr.
                                        Kabbinett, a German friend of his, and Mrs. Goodsole and I
                                        found there a very nice parlor set, in green rep, made of
                                        imitation rosewood, which he said would wear about as well
                                        as the genuine article, and which we both agreed looked
                                        nearly as well. We would rather have bought the real
                                        rosewood, but that we could not afford. Mr. Kabbinett made
                                        us a liberal discount because we were buying for a
                                        parsonage. We got an extension table and chairs for the
                                        dining-room, (but we had to omit a side-board for the
                                        present), and a very pretty oak set for the chamber. We did
                                        not buy anything but a carpet for the library, for Mr.
                                        Laicus said no<pb n="247"/> one
                                        could furnish a student's library for him. He must furnish
                                        it for himself.</p>
            <p>When we got back to Wheathedge, Tuesday afternoon, we found the
                                        parsonage undergoing transformations so great that you would
                                        hardly know it. Miss Moore had got Mr. Hardcap, sure enough,
                                        to repair it. She had agreed to pay for the material, and he
                                        was to furnish the labor. The fence was straightened, and
                                        the gate re-hung, and the blinds mended up, and Mr. Hardcap
                                        was on the roof patching it where it leaked or threatened
                                        to. Deacon Goodsole had a bevy of boys from the
                                        Sabbath-school at work in the garden under his direction. If
                                        there is anything the Deacon takes a pride in, next to his
                                        horse, it is his garden, and he said that the parson should
                                        have a chance for the best garden in town. Great piles of
                                        weeds stood in the walk. Two boys were spading up; another
                                        was planting; a fourth was wheeling away the weeds; and
                                        still another was bringing manure from the Deacon's stable.
                                        Miss Moore was setting out some rose-bushes before the door;
                                        and the Deacon himself, with his coat off, was trimming and
                                        tying up a rather dilapidated<pb n="248"/> looking grape-vine over a still more dilapidated grape
                                        arbor.</p>
            <p>The next morning, about eleven o'clock, little Miss Flidgett came
                                        running into our house, without ever knocking, in the
                                        greatest possible excitement.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Laicus," said she, "the painters have come."</p>
            <p>"The painters!" said I. "What painters?"</p>
            <p>"Why didn't you order them?" said she.</p>
            <p>"They are painting the parsonage. I supposed of course you
                                        ordered them."</p>
            <p>It was very evident that she did not suppose anything of the
                                        kind, but was dying of curiosity to know who did. I confess
                                        I had some curiosity to know myself. So I put on my bonnet
                                        and shawl, and ran over with her to find out about it. Sure
                                        enough the painters were there, three or four of them, with
                                        their ladders up against the side of the house, and the
                                        parsonage already beginning to change color under their
                                        hands. Some of the ladies were in the kitchen supervising
                                        the repairs of the sink, and the putting up of some shelves
                                        in the pantry, but they knew nothing about the painters. I
                                        asked one of the<pb n="249"/>
                                        hands, at work on the front door, who sent him.</p>
            <p>"The boss, ma'am," he replied, very promptly.</p>
            <p>"And who is the boss?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Glazier, ma'am."</p>
            <p>Mr. Glazier is the painter himself, the head-man. So I was no
                                        better off than before. I was afraid Mrs. Wheaton had
                                        ordered them, and I knew our funds were getting low, for we
                                        had overrun our estimate for carpets; and I have the
                                        greatest horror of running in debt. So I resolved to go
                                        right over to Mrs. Wheaton's and get at the bottom of the
                                        mystery. But Mrs. Wheaton knew nothing of the matter. We
                                        were both sure Miss Moore would not have ordered them, and I
                                        was returning as wise as I started, when, as I passed the
                                        parsonage, I saw Mr. Glazier and Mr. Quirk in the yard,
                                        talking together. So I turned in to ask Mr. Glazier about
                                        it. As I passed up the walk Mr. Quirk called out to me.</p>
            <p>"You ladies are in possession, I see," said he. "You mean to make
                                        the parson comfortable and contented if you can."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Sir," said I, "though we are not responsible for the
                                        greatest improvement, the<pb n="250"/> painting. I think Mr. Glazier must be responsible for
                                        that himself. I can't find any one that ordered it done."</p>
            <p>I thought that would bring the information, and it did.</p>
            <p>"Oh! that's Mr. Quirk's orders," said he.</p>
            <p>"Yours?" said I turning to the crusty old landlord who wouldn't
                                        do anything.</p>
            <p>He nodded. I think he enjoyed my perplexity. I spoke on the
                                        impulse of the moment. If I had given it a second thought I
                                        should not have done it; and yet I am not sorry I did.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Quirk," said I, "my husband was right and I was wrong. We
                                        ladies thought very hard of you that you would not do
                                        anything toward repairing the parsonage. For one I want to
                                        apologize."</p>
            <p>"Judge not, that ye be not judged," said the old man; and he
                                        turned on his heel and went away. He is the queerest man I
                                        ever saw.</p>
            <p>I wish you could have seen that parsonage last Friday, the day
                                        that Mr. Mapleson and his wife were to arrive. The walks
                                        were trim. The plot before the piazza had been new sodded.
                                        The grapevine was already putting out new<pb n="251"/> buds as if it felt the
                                        effect of the Deacon's tender care. There was not a weed to
                                        be seen. The beds, with their rich, black loam turned up to
                                        the sun, had a beauty of their own, which only one who loves
                                        to dig among flowers as much as I do can appreciate. Mr.
                                        Glazier had made the dingy old house look like a new one.
                                        After all there is nothing I like better for a cottage than
                                        pure white with green blinds. Inside we had a lovely carpet
                                        on the parlor, and the new set of imitation rosewood. A
                                        beautiful bouquet from Mrs. Wheaton's garden stood in the
                                        bay window, which looks out upon the river. My girl, lent
                                        for the occasion, was in the kitchen; and in the dining-room
                                        there was supper spread just for two, with cake, preserves,
                                        and pies enough in the closet (every body in the parish had
                                        sent in supper for that evening) to keep the parson supplied
                                        for a month at least. I was the last to leave the house, and
                                        I did not leave it till I heard the whistle of the train.
                                        Then I ran over to Miss Moore's little cottage, which is
                                        right across the way. Her parlor window was full of ladies
                                        peering out, first and foremost of whom was little Miss
                                        Flidgett, who<pb n="252"/> thus
                                        gratified her wish to see how they would take it. The
                                        Deacon, who was fixing something about the stable, was
                                        almost caught. But he heard the carriage-wheels just in time
                                        to run into the shed, and I could see him there holding the
                                        door open a crack and peering out to see what passed. Even
                                        dignified Mrs. Wheaton could not resist the temptation to be
                                        passing along, accidentally of course, just as the parson
                                        drove up. Mr. Wheaton had called for them at the depot. It
                                        was arranged (with them, that is) that he was to take them
                                        right to our house, and they were to stay there till they
                                        could decide whether to board or keep house. He proposed to
                                        them, however, according to pre-arrangement, to stop a
                                        minute at the parsonage on the way. "Mrs. Mapleson," he
                                        said, "can see what it is and how she likes the house, and
                                        the location; and besides I have an errand to do at the
                                        store."</p>
            <p>We saw him get out and hand them out. Just then Mrs. Wheaton
                                        passed by, and he introduced her to them. Mrs. Wheaton took
                                        a seat in the now vacant carriage to go with her husband to
                                        the store; and Mr. and Mrs. Mapleson went up the walk. We
                                        saw them go<pb n="253"/> in and
                                        shut the door. In a moment they came out again. Maurice
                                        looked up and down the street in perplexity; then he stepped
                                        back a few paces and looked up at the house. His wife stood
                                        meanwhile on the door-step. Suddenly she beckoned to him,
                                        and pointed out something on the side of the door just over
                                        the bell-handle. They had discovered the little silver plate
                                        on which was engraved "Rev. Maurice Mapleson." At that
                                        moment the expressman drove up with their trunks. Maurice
                                        settled with him, looked up and down the street as if
                                        looking for Mr. Wheaton, who did not make his appearance as
                                        you may believe; and then parson, wife, and trunks all went
                                        into the house together, and we dispersed.</p>
            <p>As to the Deacon, he had to climb out of a back window into an
                                        ally that runs behind the house in order to get out of his
                                        position without being discovered.</p>
            <p>And that is the way we gave our donation party in Wheathedge.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
            <head type="sub">Maurice Mapleson.</head>
            <p>IT is not six weeks since Maurice Mapleson preached his first
                                        sermon here, at Wheathedge, and already events prove the
                                        wisdom of our selection. I have been studying somewhat and
                                        pondering more the secret of his success, and I have sat
                                        down this evening to try and clear up my own shadowy
                                        thoughts by reducing them to form. I often take my pen for
                                        such a purpose. Is it not Bacon who says the pen makes an
                                        accurate thinker?</p>
            <p>Maurice Mapleson certainly is not what I should call a great
                                        preacher. He is not learned. He is not brilliant. He seldom
                                        tells us much about ancient Greece or Rome. He preached a
                                        sermon on Woman's function in the church, a few Sundays ago.
                                        I could not help contrasting it with Dr. Argure's sermon on
                                        the same subject. Maurice could not have made a learned
                                        editorial or magazine article out of his sermon. He did not
                                        even discuss the true interpretation of Paul's<pb n="255"/> exhortations and
                                        prohibitions. He talked very simply and plainly of what the
                                        women could do here at Wheathedge.</p>
            <p>He thanked them with unmistakeable sincerity for what they had
                                        already done, and made it an incentive to them to do
                                        more—more for Christ, not for himself.</p>
            <p>Jennie says that is the secret of Maurice's success. He is
                                        appreciative. He never scolds. He commends his people for
                                        what they have done and so incites them to do more. She
                                        thinks that praise is a better spur than blame. She always
                                        manages her servants on that principle. Perhaps that is the
                                        reason why they are not the greatest plague of life to her.</p>
            <p>But if Maurice's sermons are not great, neither are they long. He
                                        lays it down as a cardinal rule in moral hygiene that a
                                        congregation should not go away from the church hungry.
                                        Harry no longer begs to stay at home Sunday mornings, and
                                        even Mr. Hardcap rarely gets asleep.</p>
            <p>If I compare Mr. Mapleson with Mr. Uncannon, I should say
                                        unhesitatingly that the latter was the more brilliant
                                        preacher of the two. No one ever comes out of church saying
                                                "What<pb n="256"/> a
                                        powerful discourse! What a brilliant figure! What a pretty
                                        illustration! How eloquent!" But I find that we very often
                                        spend our dinner hour in discussing not the sermon, but its
                                        subject.</p>
            <p>There are however two or three peculiarities which I observe
                                        about Maurice Mapleson's preaching. Dr. Argure tells me that
                                        he never writes a sermon without a reference to its future
                                        use. I once asked him whether he ever preached
                                        extemporaneously. "No," said he. "I have meant to. But I
                                        have so many fine sermons waiting to be preached that I
                                        could never bring myself to abandon them for a mere talk."</p>
            <p>I do not think Maurice has any fine sermons waiting to be
                                        preached. Indeed I know he has not. For one evening when he
                                        excused himself from accepting an invitation to tea, because
                                        he was behind-hand in his work and had his sermon to
                                        prepare, I replied, "You must have a good stock on hand.
                                        Give us an old one."</p>
            <p>"I haven't a sermon to my name," he replied.</p>
            <p>"What do you mean?" said I.</p>
            <p>"I mean," said he, "that a sermon is not an essay; that every
                                        sermon I ever preached was<pb n="257"/> prepared to meet some special want
                                        in my parish, and that when it was preached, there was an
                                        end of it. I could no more preach an old sermon than I could
                                        fire a charge of gun powder a second time."</p>
            <p>"But experiences repeat themselves," said my wife. "What your
                                        people at Koniwasset Corners knew of doubt, of trouble, of
                                        sorrow, of imperfect Christian experience, we know too. As
                                        in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
                                        man."</p>
            <p>"That is true," said Maurice thoughtfully. "But there are no two
                                        faces exactly alike. And my sermon is meaningless to me, if
                                        not to my people, unless I can see the want and bring out
                                        the truth to meet it."</p>
            <p>"But the truth is always the same," said Jennie, "and the wants
                                        of the human heart are not widely different."</p>
            <p>"That is both true and false," said he. "The truth is always the
                                        same; but not always the same to me. I fell into
                                        conversation with Mr. Gear last night on the subject of the
                                        atonement. He thinks it represents God as revengeful and
                                        unforgiving. Can I answer him with an old<pb n="258"/> sermon? God's love
                                        is immutable. But I hope I understand it better and feel it
                                        more than I did three years ago. I cannot bring an old
                                        experience to meet a new want. No! a sermon is like a
                                        flower, it is of worth only when it is fresh."</p>
            <p>His sermons at all events are always fresh. They are his personal
                                        counsel to personal friends. I dimly recognize this element
                                        of power in them. But this is not all. There is something
                                        more, something that I missed in Dr. Argure's learned
                                        essays, and in Mr. Uncannon's pulpit pyrotechnics. But it is
                                        something very difficult to define.</p>
            <p>Did you ever consider the difference between a real flower and a
                                        wax imitation? The latter may be quite as beautiful. It may
                                        deceive you at first. And yet when you discover the
                                        deception you are disappointed. "The lack of fragrance,"
                                        Jennie suggests. No! the flower may be odorless. It is the
                                        lack of <emph>life</emph>. I do not know what there is in
                                        that mystic life that should make such a difference. But I
                                        am sure that the charm of the flower is in its life.</p>
            <p>The most beautiful statue that Powers ever<pb n="259"/> chiseled does not
                                        compare for grace and beauty with the Divine model. The same
                                        mystic element of life is wanting.</p>
            <p>There is <emph>life</emph> in Maurice Mapleson's sermons. What do
                                        I mean by life? Earnestness? No! Mr. Work was earnest. But
                                        this mysterious life was wanting. I can feel it better than
                                        I can define it. It is not in the sermon. It is in the man.
                                        I get new information from Dr. Argure. I do not get much new
                                        information from Maurice Mapleson. I used to get new ideas
                                        occasionally from Mr. Work. I rarely get a new idea from
                                        Maurice Mapleson. But I get new life, and that is what I
                                        most want.</p>
            <p>This element of life enters into all his work. It is in the man
                                        rather than in his productions.</p>
            <p>Our prayer-meetings have improved wonderfully since he came. "How
                                        do you prepare for the prayer-meeting?" I asked him the
                                        other day.</p>
            <p>"By an hour of sleep and an hour of prayer," he replied. "I
                                        always try to go into the meeting fresh."</p>
            <p>And he succeeds. His coming into the meeting is like the coming
                                        of Spring. He brings an atmosphere with him. It is
                                                indescribable,<pb n="260"/> but its effect is marvelous. Jennie says she never
                                        understood before as she does now what was meant by the
                                        declaration in Acts concerning the Apostles, that though
                                        they were unlearned men, the people took knowledge of them
                                        that they had been with Jesus.</p>
            <p>And it is this life which makes him so admirable as a pastor. "Is
                                        he social?" a friend asked me the other day. Yes. He is
                                        social. But that is not all. Mr. Work was social. But he was
                                                <emph>always</emph> a minister. He went about the
                                        streets in a metaphysical white choker and black gown. He
                                        was everywhere professional. When he opened the subject of
                                        personal religion he did it with an introduction as formal
                                        and stately as that with which he habitually began his
                                        sermons. He formally inducted you into the witness box and
                                        commenced a professional inquisition on the state of your
                                        soul. I confess I have no fancy for that sort of
                                        Presbyterian confessional. I like the Papal confessional
                                        better. It does not invade your house and attack you with
                                        its questionings when you are in no mood for them. I told
                                        Mr. Work so once, whereat he was greatly shocked and
                                        somewhat indignant.</p>
            <pb n="261"/>
            <p>Mr. Uncannon too was very social. But he was <emph>never</emph> a
                                        minister. Outside the pulpit he never introduced the subject
                                        of religion. I think it is perfectly safe to say that no one
                                        would have taken knowledge of him that he had been with
                                        Jesus. As to pastoral calls he expressly disavowed any
                                        intention of making any. "I have no time," said he, "for
                                        gadding about and spiritual gossiping. It's as much as I can
                                        do to get up my two sermons a week."</p>
            <p>But Maurice is social in a different way. I asked him once what
                                        system he pursued as to pastoral calls.</p>
            <p>"A very simple system," said he, "mix much with my people and be
                                        much with Christ. If I do both, Mr. Laicus, I shall not fail
                                        to bring them together. I don't trouble myself about ways
                                        and means."</p>
            <p>The week after Mr. Mapleson came to Wheathedge, some
                                        ecclesiastical body met at Albany. I had a case before the
                                        Court of Appeals, and Maurice and I happened to take the
                                        same train. As we waited in the station he addressed himself
                                        to a surly looking baggage-master with this question, "What
                                        time will the train get to Albany?"</p>
            <pb n="262"/>
            <p>"Can't tell," said the surly baggage-master. "Nothing is certain
                                        to railroad men."</p>
            <p>"Except one thing," said Mr. Mapleson.</p>
            <p>"What's that?" said the surly baggage-master.</p>
            <p>"Death," said Mr. Mapleson.</p>
            <p>"That's a fact," said the surly baggage-master. "Specially
                                        certain to railroad men."</p>
            <p>"And there is one other thing certain," added Maurice.</p>
            <p>"What's that?" asked the baggage-master, no longer surly.</p>
            <p>"That we ought to be ready for it."</p>
            <p>The baggage-master nodded thoughtfully. "So we ought," said he;
                                        and he added as he turned away, "I hope you're readier than
                                        I be."</p>
            <p>I note this little incident here because it revealed so much of
                                        Maurice Mapleson's character to me. I think it did more to
                                        disclose to me the secret of his success than any sermon he
                                        has ever preached. Mr. Work when he went away read us the
                                        statistics of his ministerial industry. He told us how many
                                        sermons he had preached, how many prayer<pb n="263"/> meetings he had
                                        attended, how many sick he had visited, and how many
                                        religious conversations he had held with the impenitent. I
                                        should as soon think of Maurice Mapleson's keeping a record
                                        of the number of times he kissed his wife or taught his
                                        children—if he had any.</p>
            <p>While I have been writing in a vain endeavor to put my vague and
                                        shadowy ideas of Maurice Mapleson's magnetic power into
                                        words, Jennie has come in and has seated herself beside me.</p>
            <p>"Jennie, I cannot get into clear and tangible form my shadowy
                                        ideas. What is the secret of ministerial success? What is
                                        the common characteristic which gives pulpit power to such
                                        widely dissimilar characters as Chalmers, Whitefields, the
                                        Westleys, Spurgeon and Robertson in England, and Edwards,
                                        Nettleton, Finney, the Beechers, father and son, Murray,
                                        John Hall, Dr. Tyng, and a score of others I could mention
                                        in this country?"</p>
            <p>"Hand me your New Testament, John."</p>
            <p>It was lying on the table beside me. She took it from my hand and
                                        opened it.</p>
            <p>"I don't know as to all the names you have mentioned, John, but I
                                        think the secret of true<pb n="264"/> pulpit power, the secret of Paul's wondrous power, the
                                        secret of Maurice Mapleson's power—the same in
                                        kind though smaller in measure—is this. And she
                                        read from Galatians, the second chapter and twentieth verse:</p>

            <head type="sub">Our Church-Garden.</head>
            <p>ONE needs no other evidence that Maurice Mapleson is working a
                                        wonderful transformation in this parish than is afforded by
                                        the change which has been made in the external appearance of
                                        the church. It is true that Miss Moore always was a worker.
                                        But I do not believe that even Miss Moore could have carried
                                        out her plan of a church garden under Mr. Work. And Mr. Work
                                        was a good minister too.</p>
            <p>When I first came to Wheathedge the Calvary Presbyterian church
                                        was externally, to the passer-by, distinguished chiefly for
                                        the severe simplicity of its architecture, and the
                                        plainness, not to say the homeliness, of its surroundings.
                                        It is a long, narrow, wooden structure, as destitute of
                                        ornament as Squire Line's old fashioned barn. Its only
                                        approximation to architectural display is a square tower
                                        surmounted by four tooth-picks pointing heavenward, and
                                        encasing the bell. A singular, a<pb n="266"/> mysterious bell that
                                        was and is. It expresses all the emotions of the
                                        neighborhood. It passes through all the moods and
                                        inflections of a hundred hearts. To-day it rings out with
                                        soft and sacred tones its call to worship. To-morrow from
                                        its watch-tower it sees the crackling flame in some
                                        neighboring barn or tenement, and utters, with loud and
                                        hurried and anxious voice, its alarm. Anon, heavy with
                                        grief, it seems to enter, as a sympathising friend, into the
                                        very heart experiences of bereaved and weeping mourners. And
                                        when the rolling year brings round Independence day, all the
                                        fluctuations of feeling which mature and soften others are
                                        forgotten, and it trembles with the excitement of the
                                        occasion, and laughs, and shouts, and capers merrily in its
                                        homely belfry, as though it were a boy again.</p>
            <p>Pardon the digression. But I love the dear old bell. And its
                                        voice is musical to me, albeit I sometimes fancy, like many
                                        another singer's it is growing weak and thin with age.</p>
            <p>The surroundings of the church were no better than the external
                                        aspect. The fence was broken down. The cows made common
                                                pasture<pb n="267"/> in
                                        the field—there is an acre of ground with the
                                        church, I believe—till the grass was eaten so
                                        close to the ground that even they disdained it. A few trees
                                        eked out a miserable existence. Most of them, girdled by
                                        cattle, were dead. A few still maintained their "struggle
                                        for life," but looked as though they pined for the freedom
                                        of the woods again. Within, the church justified the promise
                                        of its external condition. The board of trustees are poor.
                                        Every man had been permitted to upholster his own pew. Some,
                                        without owners, were also without upholstering. In the rest,
                                        the only merit was variety. The church looked as though it
                                        had clothed itself in a Joseph's coat of many colors; or
                                        rather, its robe presented the appearance of poor Joe
                                        Sweaten's pantaloons, which are so darned and pieced and
                                        mended that no man can guess what the original material was,
                                        or whether any of it is left. There was but one redeeming
                                        feature—the bouquet upon the pulpit. Every Sunday,
                                        Sophie Jowett brought that bouquet. As her father had a
                                        large conservatory, the bouquet was rarely missing even in
                                        winter. As she has admirable taste it was always beautiful
                                                even<pb n="268"/> when
                                        the flowers were not rare. She had done her work very
                                        quietly, had asked no permission, had consulted with no one.
                                        One Sabbath the bouquet appeared upon the pulpit. After that
                                        it was never missing, except one Sunday when Miss Sophie was
                                        sick, and for three weeks in the Fall, when she was away
                                        from home.</p>
            <p>Such was the condition of the church at Wheathedge when I bought
                                        my house.</p>
            <p>Last spring Miss Sophie was married. There were more tears and
                                        less radiance than usual at that wedding. Mr. Line said that
                                        he never could supply the place in the Sunday-school. Mr.
                                        Work came up from New York to marry them. His voice was
                                        tenderer than usual when he pronounced the marriage
                                        ceremony. The first Sabbath after that wedding the pulpit
                                        was without flowers. Was there any who did not miss them,
                                        and in missing them did not miss her? It took the last
                                        ornament from our church, which thenceforth looked desolated
                                        enough.</p>
            <p>When Maurice Mapleson came the bouquet came back. But it was made
                                        mostly of wild flowers. I think his wife began it. Perhaps
                                                it<pb n="269"/> was this
                                        which suggested to Miss Moore's fertile brain the idea of a
                                        church-garden.</p>
            <p>At all events one Wednesday after prayer-meeting Miss Moore and
                                        Mrs. Biskit came to me. "We want a dollar from you," said
                                        Miss Moore.</p>
            <p>"What for?" said I. Not that I thought of questioning Miss
                                        Moore's demand,—no one ever does that; but because
                                        I naturally liked to know what my money was going to do.</p>
            <p>"We are going to start a church-garden," said she. "The trustees
                                        have given us the ground, and we want to raise about ten
                                        dollars for a beginning."</p>
            <p>I gave her the dollar and thought no more about it; indeed, I
                                        should have accounted the scheme quite chimerical if there
                                        had been any one at the head of it except Miss Moore.</p>
            <p>However, the next week, as I was passing the church, I saw Miss
                                        Moore and Mrs. Biskit at work in the churchyard. A little
                                        plot had been spaded up at one side, one or two walks laid
                                        out, and they were busy putting in some flower seed. I
                                        thought of offering my services. But as my agricultural
                                        education was neglected in my<pb n="270"/> youth, and as my knowledge of gardening is very limited,
                                        I passed on.</p>
            <p>My chance came pretty soon. When Miss Moore has anything to do
                                        for the church every one gets an opportunity to help.</p>
            <p>It could not have been more than two or three days later, when,
                                        as I passed, I perceived that she had already increased her
                                        stock of gardeners. Half a dozen young men were working with
                                        a will. She had half of the minister's Bible-class engaged.
                                        Two of them had brought a load of gravel from down under the
                                        hill as you go to the Mill village. They were shoveling this
                                        out at the front gate, while some others were spreading it
                                        in a broad walk up to the church-door. A great pile of sods
                                        lay right by the side of the growing gravel-heap. Deacon
                                        Goodsole, in his shirt sleeves, was raking over the ground
                                        preparing it for grass-seed. "Rather late for grass-seed,"
                                        he had remonstrated, but the inexorable Miss Moore had
                                        replied, "Better late than never." Four or five of the boys,
                                        who had used the church common as a ball-ground, were
                                        enlisted—a capital stroke of policy that. Among
                                        them was Bill Styles, who prides himself<pb n="271"/> on throwing a stone
                                        higher and with surer aim than any other boy in Wheathedge,
                                        and had demonstrated it by stoning all the glass out of the
                                        tower windows. A melancholy-looking cow, transfixed with
                                        astonishment, had stopped in the middle of the road to look
                                        with bewilderment upon their invasion of its ancient
                                        territory. I leaned for a moment on the tottering fence and
                                        looked, equally bewildered, on the busy scene.</p>
            <p>But Miss Moore never suffers any one to look on idly where she is
                                        laboring. "Ah! Mr. Laicus," said she, cheerily, "you are
                                        just the man we want. That cow will come in through these
                                        gaps in the fence and undo our work in an hour after we
                                        leave it. I wish you would get hold of somebody and fix it
                                        up." With that she was off again, and I was in for an
                                        office.</p>
            <p>Deacon Goodsole afterwards told me confidentially that he was
                                        caught in the same way.</p>
            <p>Now, though I am no gardener, I am a bit of a carpenter. So,
                                        after taking the dimensions of the fence, mentally, I
                                        started off for the material, which Mr. Hardcap gave, and,
                                        with the aid of a volunteer or two, I succeeded in so far
                                        filling the<pb n="272"/> breach
                                        that the melancholy cow gave up her little game, and walked
                                        philosophically away.</p>
            <p>To make a long story short, the result of Miss Moore's energetic
                                        endeavors was seen the next Sabbath, in part, in an entirely
                                        new aspect of affairs, which has been constantly improving
                                        since. The board of trustees, moved thereto partly by the
                                        energies of Miss Moore, partly by those of their Baptist
                                        neighbors who have just got into a new church, have
                                        commenced to build a new fence. A graveled walk, free from
                                        dust in drought and from mud in rainy weather, leads up to
                                        the church-door. A border of sod on either side melts
                                        gradually away into the beginning of a lawn of grass which
                                        will be fuller and better next year than this. On a couple
                                        of fan shaped lattices, in which I take a little pride as my
                                        own handiwork, a honey-suckle on one side of the church-door
                                        and a prairie rose on the other are planted. In imagination
                                        I already see them reaching out their tendrils in courtship
                                        over the door. I should not wonder if next Spring should
                                        celebrate their nuptials. Some ivy, planted by Miss Moore,
                                        on the eastern side of the church promises in time to
                                                embosom<pb n="273"/> it
                                        in green. A parterre of flowers in the rear, has already
                                        helped to furnish the pulpit every Sunday with a bouquet,
                                        and, Miss Moore declares, will, another summer, give the
                                        minister a bouquet on his study table all the week, and
                                        messengers of beauty to add to the comfort of many a
                                        sick-room. And in the Fall Deacon Goodsole and I with half a
                                        dozen young men from the pastor's Bible-class are going up
                                        into the woods for some maples to set out in the place of
                                        the dead sticks which served only as monuments of the
                                        departed.</p>
            <p>But Miss Moore is in a quandary. She does not know what to do
                                        with her ten dollars. All the work was given. Even Pat
                                        Maloney, Roman Catholic though he is, would not take
                                        anything for spading up the ground for "our church garden."</p>
            <p>I am a conservative man. But I do wish Miss Moore could be
                                        chairman of our board of trustees for a year or two.</p>

            <p>IT is late in the fall. The summer birds have fled southward. The
                                        summer residents have fled to their city homes. The
                                        mountains have blossomed out in all the brilliance of their
                                        autumnal colors; but the transitory glory has gone and they
                                        are brown and bare. One little flurry of snow has given us
                                        warning of what is coming. The furnace has been put in
                                        order; the double windows have been put on; a storm-house
                                        has enclosed our porch; a great pile of wood lies up against
                                        the stable, giving my boy promise of plenty of exercise
                                        during the long winter. And still the summer lingers in
                                        these bright and glorious autumnal days. And of them the
                                        carpenters and the painters are making much in their work on
                                        the new library-hall.</p>
            <p>Do not let the reader deceive himself by erecting in his
                                        imagination an edifice of brick or stone, with all the
                                        magnificent architectural<pb n="275"/> display which belongs to the modern
                                        style of American cosmopolitan architecture. Library-hall is
                                        a plain wooden building, one story high, and containing but
                                        three rooms. It is to cost us just $1,000, when it is
                                        finished. Let me record here how it came to be begun.</p>
            <p>Temperance is not one of the virtues for which Wheathedge is, or
                                        ought to be, famous. I know not where you will find cooler
                                        springs of more delicious water, than gush from its mountain
                                        sides. I know not where you will find grapes for home
                                        wine—that modern recipe for
                                        drunkenness—more abundant or more admirably
                                        adapted to the vintner's purpose. But the springs have few
                                        customers, and one man easily makes all the domestic wine
                                        which the inhabitants of Wheathedge consume. But at the
                                        landing there are at least four grog-shops which give every
                                        indication of doing a thriving business, beside Poole's,
                                        half-way to the Mill village; to say nothing of the bar the
                                        busiest room by all odds, at Guzzem's hotel, busiest, alas!
                                        on the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>Maurice Mapleson is not one who considers that his parish and his
                                        congregation are coterminus. "I like the Established Church
                                                for<pb n="276"/> one
                                        thing," he says. "The parish is geographical, not
                                        ecclesiastical. All within its bounds are under the parson's
                                        care. In our system the minister is only responsible for his
                                        own congregation. It is like caring for the wounded who are
                                        brought into hospital, and leaving those that are on the
                                        field of battle uncared for."</p>
            <p>A little incident occurring soon after he came, first opened
                                        Maurice's eyes, I think, to the need of temperance reform in
                                        the community.</p>
            <p>He had occasion, one evening after prayer-meeting, to visit a
                                        sick child of his Sabbath-school. The family were poor and
                                        his road led him down near the brickyard toward "Limerick,"
                                        as this settlement of huts—half house, half
                                        pig-stye—is derisively called. The night was dark,
                                        and returning, abstracted in thought, he almost fell over
                                        what he first took to be a log lying in the street. It was a
                                        man, who, on a cursory examination, proved to be suffering
                                        under no less a disorder than that of hopeless intoxication.
                                        It was a dangerous bed. Maurice made one or two unsuccessful
                                        attempts to arouse the fellow, but in vain. Retracing his
                                        steps a few rods to the nearest hut, he summoned assistance,
                                                and<pb n="277"/> with the
                                        aid of Pat sober, got Pat drunk upon his feet. But he was
                                        quite too drunk to help himself, and too large and heavy to
                                        be left to the sole charge of Pat sober, who happened to
                                        recognize a friend, whose home he said was a quarter of a
                                        mile down the valley. Maurice, who had preached a few
                                        Sundays ago on the parable of the <title>Good
                                        Samaritan</title>, could not bring himself to imitate the
                                        example of the Priest and Levite; so steadying the tipsy
                                        pedestrian on one side, while sober Pat sustained him on the
                                        other, they half led, half dragged the still unconscious
                                        sleeper to a little round hut, which he called home. The
                                        wife was sitting up for her husband and received both him
                                        and his custodians with objurgations loud on the first, and
                                        thanks equally loud addressed to the others. No sooner was
                                        the stupid husband safely deposited on the bed than, begging
                                        them to wait a moment, she went to the cupboard and taking
                                        down a big, black bottle, half filled a cracked tea-cup with
                                        whiskey, which she offered to Maurice as an expression of
                                        her gratitude. "I do not know," said Maurice to me, as he
                                        told me the story, "that she will ever forgive me for<pb n="278"/> declining, though I
                                        couched my declension as courteously as possible."</p>
            <p>Coming home and pondering this incident, he made up his mind that
                                        something must be done for the temperance cause in
                                        Wheathedge; and further pondering led him to the conclusion
                                        that he must begin at the church.</p>
            <p>So one evening last week he came round to talk with me about it.</p>
            <p>"The first thing," said he to me, "is to arouse the Church. I
                                        believe in preaching the gospel of temperance to the Jews
                                        first, and afterwards to the Gentiles. I will begin in the
                                        Synagogue. Afterwards I will go to the streets, and lanes,
                                        and highways."</p>
            <p>"You will meet with some opposition," said I. "A temperance
                                        meeting in the church has never been heard of in Wheathedge.
                                        You will be departing from the landmarks."</p>
            <p>"Do you think so?" said Maurice.</p>
            <p>"I am sure of it," said I.</p>
            <p>"Very good," said he, "if I meet with opposition it will prove I
                                        am right. It will prove that the Church needs stirring up on
                                        the subject. If I am not opposed I shall be inclined to give
                                                up<pb n="279"/> the plan.
                                        However I will not wait for opportunity. I will challenge
                                        it."</p>
            <p>The next Sunday he gave notice that that evening there would be a
                                        Temperance prayer and conference meeting in the church, in
                                        lieu of preaching.</p>
            <p>"The town," said he, "is cursed with intemperance. There is one
                                        miscellaneous dry-goods and grocery store, one drug store,
                                        one mill, about half a bookstore, and an ice-cream saloon;
                                        and within a radius of half a mile of this church there are
                                        ten grog-shops and two distilleries, quite too large a
                                        proportion even for those who believe, as I do not, in
                                        moderate drinking. I have no remedy to propose. I have no
                                        temperance address to deliver. What I do propose is that we
                                        gather to-night and make it the subject of earnest prayer to
                                        God, and of serious conference among ourselves, that we may
                                        know what our duty is in the case, and knowing, may do it
                                        bravely and well."</p>
            <p>As we came out of church the proposed Temperance prayer-meeting
                                        was the theme of general discussion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Guzzem was sorry to see that this church<pb n="280"/> was threatened with
                                        an irruption of fanaticism. He thought the minister had
                                        better stick to his business and leave side-issues alone.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton thought the true remedy for intemperance was the
                                        cultivation of the grape, and the manufacture of modern
                                        wines. He did not believe in meetings.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap was as much a foe to intemperance as any one; but he
                                        thought the true remedy for intemperance was the preaching
                                        of the Gospel. Paul was the model for preachers, and Paul
                                        knew nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified. Deacon
                                        Goodsole inquired who that man was that preached before
                                        Felix of righteousness, <emph>temperance</emph>, and
                                        judgment to come. But Mr. Hardcap apparently did not hear
                                        the question, at least he did not answer it.</p>
            <p>Elder Law thought it might be very well, but that the minister
                                        ought not to change the service of the Sabbath without
                                        consulting the Session. It was a dangerous precedent.</p>
            <p>Deacon Goodsole thought it a move in the right direction, and
                                        vowed he would give the afternoon to drumming up recruits.
                                        Miss Moore said she would go with him.</p>
            <pb n="281"/>
            <p>Mr. Gear, who has not been inside a prayer-meeting since he has
                                        been at Wheathedge, declared when I told him of the meeting,
                                        that it was the first sensible thing he had ever known the
                                        church to do; and if they were really going to work in that
                                        fashion he would like to be counted in. And sure enough he
                                        was at the prayer-meeting in the evening, to the great
                                        surprise of everybody, and to the consternation of Mr.
                                        Hardcap, who found in the fact that an infidel came to the
                                        meeting, a confirmation of his opinion that it was a
                                        desecration of the Sabbath and the sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Laynes, whose eldest boy jumped off the dock last Spring in
                                        a fit of delirium tremens,
                                        came to Maurice with tears in her eyes to thank him for
                                        holding a temperance meeting. "I can't do anything but
                                        pray," she said; "but oh, Pastor, that I can and will do."</p>
            <p>The meeting was certainly a remarkable success, there was just
                                        opposition enough to make it so. Those that were determined
                                        it should succeed were there ready to speak, to sing, to
                                        pray. Those that did not believe in it were there to see it
                                        fail. Those<pb n="282"/> that
                                        were indifferent were there, curious to see whether it would
                                        succeed or fail, and what it would be like. And Deacon
                                        Goodsole and Miss Moore were there with their recruits, a
                                        curious and motley addition to the congregation. The church
                                        was full. Every ear was attention; every heart aroused. And
                                        when finally good old Father Hyatt, with his thin white hair
                                        and tremulous voice, and eyes suffused with tears, told in
                                        tones of unaffected pathos, the sad story of Charl. Pie's
                                        death, I do not believe that even Jim Wheaton's eyes were
                                        dry. At all events I noticed that when, at the close of the
                                        meeting, Maurice put the question whether a second meeting
                                        should be held the following month, Jim Wheaton was among
                                        those who voted in the affirmative. There were no
                                        dissentients.</p>
            <p>When I came home from this meeting, I put on paper as well as I
                                        could Father Hyatt's pathetic story. It is as follows:</p>

            <head type="sub">Father Hyatt's Story.</head>
            <p>IF you had known Charlie P., and had seen his little struggle,
                                        and had felt as I did the anguish caused by his tragic
                                        death, you would not talk of moderate drinking as a remedy
                                        for intemperance.</p>
            <p>I was away from my parish when I first heard of it. I very well
                                        remember the start with which I read the first line of the
                                        note, "Charlie P—— is dead;" and how
                                        after I had finished the account, written in haste and
                                        partaking of the confusion of the hour, the letter dropped
                                        from my hands, and I sat in the gathering darkness of the
                                        summer twilight, rehearsing to myself the story of his life,
                                        and the sad, sad story of his tragic death. Years have
                                        passed since, but the whole is impressed upon my memory in
                                        figures that time cannot fade. If I were an artist, I could
                                        paint his portrait, I am sure, as I see him even now. Such a
                                        grand, open-hearted, whole-souled fellow as he was.</p>
            <pb n="284"/>
            <p>It was about a year before that I first saw him in my church. His
                                        peculiar gait as he walked up the center aisle, first
                                        attracted my attention. He carried a stout cane and walked a
                                        little lame. His wife was with him. Indeed, except at his
                                        office, I rarely saw them apart. She loved him with an
                                        almost idolatrous affection; as well she might, for he was
                                        the most lovable man I ever knew; and he loved her with a
                                        tenderness almost womanly. I think he never for a moment
                                        forgot that it was her assiduous nursing which saved his
                                        life. His face attracted me from the first, and I rather
                                        think I called on the new-comers that very week. At all
                                        events we soon became fast friends, and at the very next
                                        communion husband and wife united with my church by letter
                                        from ——, but no matter where; I had best
                                        give neither names nor dates. They lived in a quite, simple
                                        way, going but little into society, for they were society to
                                        each other. They rarely spent an evening out, if I except
                                        the weekly prayer-meeting. They came together to that. He
                                        very soon went into the Sabbath-school. A Bible-class of
                                        young people gathered about him as if by magic. He had<pb n="285"/> just the genial
                                        way, the social qualities, and the personal magnetism to
                                        draw the young to him. I used to look about sometimes with a
                                        kind of envy at the eager attentive faces of his class.</p>
            <p>Judge of my surprise when, one day, a warm friend of Charlie's
                                        came to me, privately, and said, "Charlie P. is drinking."</p>
            <p>"Impossible," said I.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" said he, "it is too true. I have talked with him time and
                                        again. He promises reform, but keeps no promise. His wife is
                                        almost broken-hearted, but carries her burden alone. You
                                        have influence with him, more than any one else I think. I
                                        want you to see him and talk with him."</p>
            <p>I promised, of course. I made the effort, but without success. I
                                        called once or twice at his office. He was always immersed
                                        in business. I called at his house. But I never could see
                                        him alone. I was really and greatly perplexed, when he
                                        relieved me of my perplexity. Perhaps he suspected my
                                        design. At all events one morning he surprised me by a call
                                        at my study. He opened the subject at once himself.</p>
            <pb n="286"/>
            <p>"Pastor," said he, "I have come to talk with you about myself. I
                                        am bringing shame on the Church and disgrace on my family.
                                        You know all about it. Everybody knows all about it. I
                                        wonder that the children do not point at me in the street as
                                        I go along. Oh! my poor wife! my poor wife! what shall I
                                        do?"</p>
            <p>He was intensely excited. I suspected that he had been drinking
                                        to nerve himself to what he regarded as a disagreeable but
                                        unavoidable duty. I calmed him as well as I could, and he
                                        told me his story.</p>
            <p>He was formerly a temperate though never a total abstinence man.
                                        He was employed on a railroad in some
                                        capacity—express messenger I think. The cars ran
                                        off the track. That in which he was sitting was thrown down
                                        an embankment. He was dreadfully bruised and mangled, and
                                        was taken up for dead. It seemed at first as though he had
                                        hardly a whole bone in his body; but by one of those
                                        marvelous freaks, as we account them, which defeat all
                                        physicians' calculations, he survived. Gradually he rallied.
                                        For twelve months he lived on stimulants. His wife's
                                        assiduous nursing through these twelve<pb n="287"/> months of anxiety
                                        prostrated her upon a bed of sickness. From his couch he
                                        arose, as he supposed, to go through life on crutches. But
                                        returning strength had enabled him to substitute a cane. Her
                                        attack of typhoid fever left her an invalid, never to be
                                        strong again. Alas! his twelve months' use of stimulants had
                                        kindled a fire within him which it seemed impossible to
                                        quench.</p>
            <p>"I cannot do my work," said he, "without a little, and a little
                                        is enough to overset me. I am not a hard drinker, Pastor,
                                        indeed I am not. But half a glass of liquor will sometimes
                                        almost craze me."</p>
            <p>I told him he must give up the little. For him there was but one
                                        course of safety, that of total abstinence. He was reluctant
                                        to come to it. His father's sideboard was never empty. It
                                        was hard to put aside the notions of hospitality which he
                                        had learned in his childhood, and adopt the principles of a
                                        total abstinence, which he had always been taught to
                                        ridicule. However, he resolved bravely, and went away from
                                        my study, as I fondly hoped, a saved man.</p>
            <p>I had not then learned, as I have since, the<pb n="288"/> meaning of the
                                        declaration, "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
                                        weak."</p>
            <p>I saw him every few days. He never showed any signs of liquor. I
                                        asked him casually, as I had opportunity, how he was getting
                                        along. He always answered, "Well." I sounded others
                                        cautiously. No one suspected him of any evil habit. I
                                        concluded he had conquered it. Though I did not lose him
                                        from my thoughts or prayers, I grew less anxious. He kept
                                        his Bible-class, which grew in numbers and in interest.
                                        Spring came, and I relaxed a little my labors, as that
                                        climate—no matter where it was, to me the climate
                                        was bad enough—required it. Despite the caution,
                                        the subtle malaria laid hold of me. I fought for three weeks
                                        a hard battle with disease. When I arose from my bed the
                                        doctor forbade all study and all work for six weeks at
                                        least. No minister can rest in his own parish. My people
                                        understood that, as parishes do not always. One bright
                                        spring day, one of my deacons called, and put a sealed
                                        envelope into my hand to be opened when he had left. It
                                        contained a check for my traveling expenses, and an official
                                        note from the officers of the<pb n="289"/> church bidding me go and spend it.
                                        In three days I was on my way to the White Mountains. It was
                                        there my wife's hurried note told me the story of Charlie's
                                        death. And this was it:</p>
            <p>The habit had proved too strong for his weak will. He had resumed
                                        drinking. No one knew it but his wife and one confidential
                                        friend. He rarely took much; never so much as to be brutal
                                        at home, or unfit for business at the office; but enough to
                                        prove to him that he was not his own master. The shame of
                                        his bondage he felt keenly, powerless as he felt himself to
                                        break the chains. The week after I left home his wife left
                                        also for a visit to her father's. She took the children, one
                                        a young babe three months old, with her. Mr. P. was to
                                        follow her in a fortnight. She never saw him again. One
                                        night he went to his solitary home. Possibly he had been
                                        drinking—no one ever knew—opened his
                                        photograph album, covered his own photograph with a piece of
                                        an old envelope, that it might no longer look upon the
                                        picture of his wife on the opposite page, and wrote her, on
                                        a scrap of paper torn from a letter, this line of farewell:</p>

            <p>The next morning, long after the streets had resumed their
                                        accustomed activity, and other houses threw wide open their
                                        shutters to admit the fragrance of flowers, and the song of
                                        birds, and the glad sunshine, and all the joy of life, that
                                        house was shut and still. When the office clerk, missing
                                        him, came to seek him, the door was fast. Neighbors were
                                        called in. A window was forced open. Lying upon the bed,
                                        where he had fallen the night before, lay poor Charlie P. A
                                        few drops of blood stained the white coverlet. It oozed from
                                        a bullet wound in the back of his head. The hand in death
                                        still grasped the pistol that fired the fatal shot.</p>

            <p>TO that prayer-meeting and Father Hyatt's story of Charlie P.,
                                        Wheathedge owes its library.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Laicus," said Mr. Gear as we came out of the meeting
                                        together, "I hope this temperance movement isn't going to
                                        end in a prayer-meeting. The praying is all very well, but I
                                        want to see some work go along with it."</p>
            <p>"Very well," said I, "what do you propose?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know," said he. "But I think we might do something. I
                                        believe in the old proverb. The gods help those who help
                                        themselves."</p>
            <p>That very week Mr. Mapleson called at my house to express the
                                        same idea. "What can we do to shut up Poole's?" said he.
                                        "It's dreadful. Half our young men spend half their evenings
                                        there lounging and drinking away their time." He proposed
                                        half a dozen plans and abandoned them as fast as he proposed
                                        them. He <orig>sug-</orig>
               <pb n="292"/> gested that we
                                        organize a Sons of Temperance, and gave it up because
                                        neither of us believed in secret societies; suggested
                                        organizing a Band of Hope in the Sabbath-school, but
                                        withdrew the suggestion on my remarking that the
                                        Sabbath-school would not touch the class that made Poole's
                                        bar the busiest place in town; hinted at trying to get John
                                        B. Gough, but doubted whether he could be obtained. I told
                                        him I would think it over. And the next evening I walked up
                                        to Poole's to survey the ground a little. I found, just as
                                        you turn the corner from the Main street to go up the hill,
                                        what I had never noticed before—a sign, not very
                                        legible from old age and dirt, "Free Reading-room." Having
                                        some literary predilections, I went in. A bar-room, with
                                        three or four loungers before the counter, occupied the
                                        foreground. In the rear were two round wooden tables. On one
                                        were half a dozen copies of notorious sensation sheets, one
                                        or two with infamous illustrations. A young lad of sixteen
                                        was gloating over the pages of one of them. The other table
                                        was ornamented with a backgammon board and a greasy pack of
                                                cards.<pb n="293"/> The
                                        atmosphere of the room was composed of the commingled fumes
                                        of bad liquor, bad tobacco, kerosene oil and coal gas. It
                                        did not take me long to gauge the merits of the free
                                        reading-room. But I inwardly thanked the proprietor for the
                                        suggestion it afforded me.</p>
            <p>"A free reading-room," said I to myself; "that is what we want at
                                        Wheathedge."</p>
            <p>The same thought had fortunately occurred almost simultaneously
                                        to my friend Mr. Korley, though his reason for desiring its
                                        establishment were quite different from mine. His family
                                        spends every summer at Wheathedge. His wife and daughters
                                        found themselves at a loss how to spend their time. They had
                                        nothing to do. They pestered Mr. Korley to bring them up the
                                        last novels. But his mind was too full of stocks; he always
                                        forgot the novels. On Saturday he went over to Newtown,
                                        hearing there was a circulating library there. He found the
                                        sign, but no books. "I had some books once," the proprietor
                                        explained, "but the Wheathedge folks carried them all off
                                        and never returned them." Thus it happened that when the
                                        week after my visit to the free reading-room, I met<pb n="294"/> Mr. Korley on board
                                        the train, he remarked to me, "We ought to have a
                                        circulating library at Wheathedge."</p>
            <p>"And a reading-room with it," said I.</p>
            <p>"Well, yes," said he. "That's a fact. A good reading-room would
                                        be a capital thing."</p>
            <p>"Think of the scores of young men," said I, "that are going down
                                        to ruin there. They have no home, no decent shelter even for
                                        a winter's evening, except the grog-shop."</p>
            <p>"I don't care so much about the young men," said Mr. Korley, "as
                                        I do about the middle-aged ones: My Jennie pesters me almost
                                        to death every time I go down, to buy her something to read.
                                        Of course I always forget it. Besides, I would like a place
                                        where I could see the papers and periodicals myself. I would
                                        give fifty dollars to see a good library and reading-room in
                                        Wheathedge."</p>
            <p>"Very good," said I, "I will put you down for that amount." So I
                                        took out my pocket-book and made a memorandum.</p>
            <p>"What! are you taking subscriptions?" asked Mr. Korley.</p>
            <p>"Have taken one," said I.</p>
            <pb n="295"/>
            <p>That was the beginning. That night I took a blank book and drew
                                        up a subscription paper. It was very simple. It read as
                                        follows:</p>
            <quote>
                                        <p>"We, the undersigned, for the purpose of establishing a
                                                library and reading-room in Wheathedge, subscribe
                                                the sums set opposite our names, and agree that when
                                                $500 is subscribed the first subscribers shall call
                                                a meeting of the others to form an
                                        organization."</p>
                                </quote>
            <p>I put Mr. Korley's name down for $50, which started it well. Mr.
                                        Jowett could do no less than Mr. Korley, and Mr. Wheaton no
                                        less than Mr. Jowett; and so, the subscription once started,
                                        grew very rapidly, like a boy's snowball, to adequate
                                        proportions. The second Tuesday in July I was enabled to
                                        give notice to all the subcribers to meet at my house. My parlors were well
                                        filled. I had taken pains to get some lady subscribers, and
                                        they were there as well as the gentlemen. I read to the
                                        company the law of the State providing for the organization
                                        of a library association. Resolutions were drawn up and
                                        adopted. Stock was fixed at $5, that everybody might be a
                                        stockholder. The annual dues were made $2, imposed alike on
                                                stockholders<pb n="296"/> and on
                                        outsiders. A Board of trustees was elected. And so our
                                        little boat was fairly launched.</p>
            <p>We began in a very humble way. The school trustees loaned us
                                        during the summer vacation a couple of recitation-rooms
                                        which we converted into a library and conversation-room. The
                                        former we furnished in the first instance with the popular
                                        magazines and two or three of the daily newspapers. We
                                        forthwith began also to accumulate something of a library.
                                        Mr. Wheaton presented us with a full assortment of Patent
                                        Office reports, which will be very valuable for reference if
                                        any body should ever want to refer to them. We also have two
                                        shelves full chiefly of old school-books, which a committee
                                        on donations succeeded in raising in the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>But apart from these treasures of knowledge our collection is
                                        eminently readable. Maurice Mapleson is on the library
                                        committee, and Maurice Mapleson is fortunately a very
                                        sensible man. "The first thing," he says, "is to get books
                                        that people will read. Valuable books that they won't read
                                        may as well stay on the publishers'<pb n="297"/> shelves as on ours." So as yet we
                                        buy only current literature. We rarely purchase any book in
                                        more than two volumes. We have a good liberal assortment of
                                        modern novels—but they are selected with some
                                        care. We sprinkle in a good proportion of popular history
                                        and popular science. The consequence is our library is used.
                                        The books really circulate. Our conversation-room has proved
                                        quite as popular as the library. It is furnished with chess
                                        and checkers. What is more important it is furnished with
                                        young ladies. For the Wheathedge library knows neither male
                                        nor female. And the young men find our checkers more
                                        attractive than Tom Poole's cards. They are ready to
                                        exchange the stale tobacco smoke and bad whiskey of his
                                        bar-room for the fair, fresh faces that make our
                                        reading-room so attractive. The boys, too, as a class are
                                        very willing to give up the shameless pictorial literature
                                        of his free reading-room for Harper's and the
                                                <title>Illustrated Christian Weekly</title>. In a
                                        word the Wheathedge library became so universally popular
                                        that when the opening of the school threatened to crowd us
                                        out of our quarters, there was no difficulty in<pb n="298"/> raising the money to
                                        build a small house, large enough for our present and
                                        prospective needs. The only objection was Mr. Hardcap. For
                                        Mr. Hardcap does not approve of novels.</p>
            <p>This objection came out when I first asked him for a
                                        subscription, payable in work on the new building.</p>
            <p>"Do you have novels in your library?" said he.</p>
            <p>"Of course," said I.</p>
            <p>"Then," said he, "don't come to me for any help. I won't do
                                        anything to encourage the reading of novels."</p>
            <p>"You do not approve of novels, then, I judge, Mr. Hardcap?" said
                                        I.</p>
            <p>"Approve of novels!" said he, energetically. "If I had my way,
                                        the pestiferous things should never come near my house. I
                                        totally condemn them. I don't see how any consistent
                                        Christian can suffer them. They're a pack of lies, anyhow."</p>
            <p>"Do you not think," said I, "that we ought to discriminate; that
                                        there are different sorts of novels, and that we ought not
                                        to condemn the good with the bad?"</p>
            <pb n="299"/>
            <p>"I don't believe in no kind of fiction, nohow," said Mr. Hardcap,
                                        emphatically. "What we want is facts, Mr.
                                        Laicus—hard facts. That's what I was brought up on
                                        when I was a boy, and that's what I mean to bring my boys up
                                        on."</p>
            <p>I thought of Mr. Gradgrind, but said nothing.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Mr. Hardcap, half soliloquizing, "there is Charles
                                        Dickens. He was nothing in the world but a novel writer, and
                                        they buried him in Westminster Cathedral, as though he were
                                        a saint; and preached sermons about him, and glorified him
                                        in our religious papers. Sallie is crazy to get a copy of
                                        his works, and even wife wants to read some of them. But
                                        they'll have to go out of my house to do it, I tell ye. Why,
                                        they couldn't make more to do if it was Bunyan or Milton."</p>
            <p>"Bunyan?" said I. "Do you mean the author of <title>Pilgrim's
                                                Progress</title>?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," said he: "that <emph>is</emph> a book. Why, it's worth a
                                        hundred of your modern novels."</p>
            <p>"How is that?" said I. "<title>Pilgrim's Progress</title>, if I
                                        mistake not, is fiction."</p>
            <p>"Oh! well," said .Mr. Hardcap, "that's a very<pb n="300"/> different thing. It
                                        isn't a novel. It's a allegory. That's altogether
                                        different."</p>
            <p>"What is the difference?" said I.</p>
            <p>"Oh! well," said he, "that's <emph>altogether</emph> different. I
                                        suppose it is fictitious; but then it's altogether
                                        different. It's a allegory."</p>
            <p>"Now I don't approve," continued Mr. Hardcap, without explaining
                                        himself any further, "of our modern Sunday-school libraries.
                                        I have complained a good deal, but it's no use. Tom brings
                                        home a story book every Sunday. I can't very well say he
                                        shan't take any books out of the library, and I don't want
                                        to take him out of Sunday-school. But I don't like these
                                        Sunday-school stories. They are nothing but little novels
                                        anyhow. And they're all lies. I don't believe in telling
                                        stories to teach children. If I had my way, there wouldn't
                                        be but one book in the library. That would be the Bible."</p>
            <p>"You could hardly leave in all the Bible," said I. "You would
                                        have to cross out the parable of the prodigal son."</p>
            <p>"The parable of the prodigal son!" exclaimed Mr. Hardcap, in
                                        astonishment.</p>
            <pb n="301"/>
            <p>"Yes," said I: "that is, if you did not allow any fiction in your
                                        Sunday reading."</p>
            <p>"Oh!" said he, "that's very different. That's not fiction; that's
                                        a parable. That's entirely different. Besides," continued
                                        he, "I don't know what right you have to assume that it is a
                                        story at all. I have no doubt that it is true. Christ says
                                        distinctly that a man had two sons, and one came and asked
                                        him for his portion. He tells it all for a fact, and I think
                                        it very dishonoring to him to assume that it is not. I have
                                        no doubt that he knew just such a case."</p>
            <p>"And the same thing is true of the parable of the lost sheep, and
                                        the lost piece of money, and the sower, and the merchantman,
                                        and the pearl, and the unfaithful steward?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said he, "I have no doubt of it."</p>
            <p>"Well," said I, "that is at least a new view of Scripture
                                        teaching."</p>
            <p>"I have no doubt it is the correct one," said he. "I don't
                                        believe there is any fiction in the Bible at all."</p>
            <p>"Well," said I, "when you get home you read Jotham's story of the
                                        trees, in the Book of Judges; I think it's about the ninth
                                        chapter."</p>
            <pb n="302"/>
            <p>"I will," said he; "but if it's in the Bible I have no doubt it
                                        is true, no doubt whatever."</p>
            <p>But in spite of Mr. Hardcap, the Wheathedge library flourished;
                                        and next week our new quarters are to be dedicated to the
                                        cause of literature and temperance by a public meeting. And
                                        I am assured by those that know, that Tom Poole's business
                                        was never so poor as it has been since we started our
                                        opposition to his free reading-room.</p>
            <p>Miss Moore asked Maurice Mapleson last week to suggest a subject
                                        for an illuminated motto to hang on the wall of the
                                        reading-room over the librarian's desk.</p>

            <head type="sub">Maurice Mapleson Tries an Experiment.</head>
            <p>FIVE or six weeks ago Maurice came to me in some excitement. "Mr.
                                        Laicus," said he, "is it true that ten of you gentlemen have
                                        to contribute thirty dollars a piece this year to make up my
                                        salary?"</p>
            <p>"No," said I.</p>
            <p>"Why, John," said Jennie.</p>
            <p>"We didn't <emph>have</emph> to do it," I continued. But in point
                                        of fact we do it."</p>
            <p>"I don't like that," said he soberly. "If the church can't pay me
                                        fifteen hundred dollars a year I do not want to receive it.
                                        I thought the church was strong and well able to do all it
                                        professed to do."</p>
            <p>"My dear Mr. Mapleson," said I, "you attend to the spiritual
                                        interests of the church and leave its finances to us. If we
                                        cannot pay you all we have promised, we will come and beg
                                        off. Till then you just take it for granted that it's all

                                        account of that. Fifty dollars a Sabbath is a dollar a week,
                                        fifty cents a service, twenty cents a head. Harry half
                                        price, and the Sabbath-school, and the prayer-meetings, and
                                        the pastoral work thrown in. It is cheaper than any lecturer
                                        would give it to us, and a great deal better quality too. My
                                        pew rent isn't what I pay for the support of the Gospel. It
                                        is what I pay for my own spiritual bread and butter. It
                                        won't hurt me, nor Deacon Goodsole, nor Mr. Wheaton, nor Mr.
                                        Gowett, nor any one else on that list to contribute thirty
                                        dollars more for the cause of Christ and the good of the
                                        community."</p>
            <p>Maurice shook his head thoughtfully, but said<pb n="305"/> nothing more about it
                                        then, and the matter dropped.</p>
            <p>The last week in December we have our annual meeting. It is
                                        generally rather a stupid affair. The nine or ten gentlemen
                                        who constitute the board of trustees meet in the capacity of
                                        an ecclesiastical society. In the capacity of a board of
                                        trustees they report to themselves in the capacity of a
                                        society. In the capacity of a society they accept the report
                                        which they have presented in the capacity of a board of
                                        trustees, and pass unanimously a resolution of thanks to the
                                        board, abbri. e. themselves, for the efficient and
                                        energetic manner in which they have discharged their duties.
                                        They then ballot in a solemn manner for themselves for the
                                        ensuing year and elect the ticket without opposition. And
                                        the annual meeting is over.</p>
            <p>But this year our annual meeting was a very different affair. The
                                        Sabbath preceding, the parson preached a sermon on the text:
                                        "The poor have the Gospel preached to them." In this sermon
                                        he advocated a free-pew system. His arguments were not very
                                        fresh or new (there is not much that is new to be said on
                                        the subject)<pb n="306"/> till he
                                        came to the close. Then he startled us all by making the
                                        following proposition:</p>
            <p>"The chief objection," said he, "to the free-pew system is the
                                        question, 'Where shall the money come from?' From God, I
                                        answer. I believe if we feed his poor, he will feed us. I,
                                        for one, am willing to trust Him, at least for one year."</p>
            <p>It slipped out very naturally, and there was a little laugh in
                                        the congregation at the preacher's expense. But he was very
                                        much in earnest.</p>
            <p>"I propose to the society to throw open the doors of this church,
                                        and declare all the pews free. Provide envelopes and papers,
                                        and scatter them through the pews. Let each man write
                                        thereon what he is willing to pay for the support of the
                                        Gospel, and whether he will pay it weekly, monthly,
                                        quarterly, semi-quarterly or annually. Give these sealed
                                        envelopes to me. No one shall know what they contain but
                                        myself and the treasurer. I will pay out of the proceeds all
                                        the current expenses of the church, except the interest.
                                        Whatever remains, I will take as my salary. The interest,
                                        the trustees will provide out of the plate collections and
                                        with the aid of<pb n="307"/> the
                                        ladies. This is my proposition. Consider it seriously,
                                        earnestly, prayerfully, and come together next Wednesday
                                        night to act intelligently upon it."</p>
            <p>I hardly think the minister's eloquence would have sufficed to
                                        carry this plan, but the treasurer's balance-sheet helped
                                        his case amazingly.</p><p>I supposed there would be a small deficit, but thought I knew it
                                        could not be very great. But I had not reckoned on the
                                        genius for incapacity which characterises church boards. To
                                        have the unusual deficit, which was involved by the increase
                                        of the parson's salary, provided for by a special
                                        subscription was more than they could bear. They had
                                        regarded it as their duty, made plain by the example of
                                        their predecessors in office for many years, to bring the
                                        church in debt, and nobly had they fulfilled their duty. On
                                        the strength of that extraordinary subscription they had
                                        rushed into extraordinary expenditures with a looseness that
                                        was marvellous to behold. Here is the annual exhibit as it
                                        appears in the treasurer's report:</p><pb n="308"/>

                                        There was a good deal of informal discussion before the
                                        parson's proposition was taken up. Mr. Hardcap wanted to
                                        decrease the minister's salary. Mr. Wheaton wanted to raise
                                        the pew rents. Mr. Leacock thought Mr. Wheaton could afford
                                        to give up his mortgage on the church. Mr. Line proposed to
                                        take up a subscription, pay the balance off on the spot, and
                                        begin the new year afresh. Mr. Gazbag thought it ought to be
                                        left to the ladies to clear off the debt with a concert or
                                        something of that sort. Mr. Cerulian thought (though he said
                                        it very quietly) that if we had a minister who could draw
                                        better, we shouldn't have any difficulty.</p>
            <p>The parson kept his own counsel till these various plans had
                                        been, one after another, proposed and abandoned. Then he
                                        again proposed his own.</p>
            <p>"I do not want," he said, "any more salary than this church and
                                        congregation can well afford to give. I am willing if it is
                                        poor to share its poverty. I believe if it is prosperous it
                                        will be willing to share with me its prosperity. I have
                                        studied this matter a good deal; I believe the pew rent

                                        need to reach. The men who most need the Gospel will not pay

                                        pays a pew rent who does not already at least respect
                                        religion, if he does not personally practise it. The
                                        influence within the church of selling the Gospel in open
                                        market is as deadly as its influence without. It creates a
                                        caste system. Practically our pews are classified. We have a
                                        parquette, a dress circle, a family circle, and an
                                        amphitheatre. The rich and poor do not meet together. We are
                                        not one in Christ Jesus. Moreover I believe it to be as bad
                                        financially as it is morally. When an American makes a
                                        bargain he wants to make a good one. What he buys he wants
                                        to get as cheap as his neighbor. If you rent your pews,
                                        every renter expects to get his seat at the lowest rates.
                                        But Americans are liberal in giving. If they contributed to
                                        the support of the Gospel, if what they gave the church was
                                        a free gift, I believe they would give with a free hand. At
                                        all events I would like to try the experiment. It can be no
                                        worse than it has<pb n="311"/>
                                        been this year. The trustees can have no difficulty in
                                        raising interest money from the plate collections and a
                                        special subscription. There can be no injustice in requiring
                                        them to secure a special fund for any special expenditures.
                                        And all the other expenditures I will provide for myself out
                                        of the free gifts of the congregation. I am willing to run
                                        all the risks. It may do good. It can do the church no
                                        harm."</p>
            <p>A long discussion followed this proposal.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wheaton was at first utterly opposed to the plan. He thought
                                        it was tempting Providence to make no more adequate
                                        provision for our debts. Six of us quietly agreed to assume
                                        the mortgage debt, that is to say to insure him that the
                                        plate collections and the ladies together would pay the
                                        interest promptly. That changed his view. He said that if
                                        the minister had a mind to risk his salary on such a crazy
                                        scheme, very well. And at the last he voted for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap thought it was a first-rate plan. It was noticed
                                        afterward that he moved from a plain seat in the gallery to
                                        a cushioned and carpeted seat in the center aisle. Whether
                                                he<pb n="312"/> paid
                                        any more contribution than he had before paid of pew rent,
                                        nobody but the parson knows. But nobody suspects him of
                                        doing so.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Potiphar thought it was horrid. What was to prevent any
                                        common, low-born fellow, any carpenter's son, right from his
                                        shop, coming and sitting right alongside her Lillian? She
                                        couldn't sanction such communist notions in the church.</p>
            <p>Deacon Goodsole warmly favored the minister's idea—was
                                        its most earnest advocate, and was the man who first started
                                        the plan for buying Mr. Wheaton's acquiescence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Line hadn't a great deal of faith in it. This was not the way
                                        the church used to raise money when he was a boy. Still, he
                                        wanted to support the minister, and he wanted to have the
                                        poor reached, and he hadn't anything to say against it.</p>
            <p>Squire Rawlins said, "Go ahead. The minister takes all the risk,
                                        don't you see? He's a big fool in my opinion. But there's no
                                        law agin a man makin' a fool of himself, ef he wants ter."</p>
            <p>Miss Moore organized that very night a<pb n="313"/> double force to carry the plan into
                                        effect. One was a ladies' society to pay the interest; the
                                        other was a band of workers, young men and young women, to
                                        go out on Sunday afternoons and invite the people who now do
                                        not go anywhere to church, to come to ours.</p>
            <p>On the final vote the plan was carried without a dissenting
                                        voice. I beg Mrs. Potiphar's pardon. Her voice was heard in
                                        very decided dissent as the meeting broke up. But as the
                                        ladies do not vote in the Calvary Presbyterian Church, her
                                        protest did not prevent the vote from being unanimous.</p>
            <p>Maurice Mapleson is sanguine of results, I am not. I am afraid he
                                        will come out bankrupt himself at the end of the year. I
                                        wanted to raise a special subscription quietly to ensure his
                                        salary. But he would not hear of it. He replied to my
                                        suggestion, "I said I would trust the Lord, and I will. If
                                        you want to add to your envelope contribution, very well.
                                        But I do not want any more than that will give me."</p>
            <p>But one thing I notice and record here. Our congregation have
                                        increased from ten to twenty per cent. Miss Moore's
                                        invitations have met<pb n="314"/> with
                                        far greater success than I anticipated. I never could get
                                        any of the boys from the Mill village to come to church at
                                        all regularly under the old system. When this change was
                                        made I gave notice of it, and now over half my Bible-class
                                        are in the congregation. But I can get no intimation from
                                        Maurice how the plan is prospering financially. All he will
                                        say is, "We shall all know at the close of the year."</p>

            <head type="sub">Mr. Hardcap's Family Prayers.</head>
            <p>"JENNIE," said I, the other evening, "I should like to go and
                                        make a call at Mr. Hardcap's."</p>
            <p>Our new pastor had preached a sermon on that unapplied passage of
                                        Scripture, Luke xiv: 12-14. It had made a great stir in our
                                        little village. Mr. Wheaton thought it was a grand sermon,
                                        but impracticable. Mrs. Potiphar resented it as personal.
                                        Deacon Goodsole thought it was good sound doctrine. I
                                        thought I would give the sermon a trial; meanwhile I
                                        reserved my judgment.</p>
            <p>It is not a bad method, by the way, of judging a sermon to try it
                                        and see how it works in actual experiment.</p>
            <p>Jennie assented with alacrity to my proposition; her toilet did
                                        not take long, and to Mr. Hardcap's we went.</p>
            <p>It was very evident that they did not go into society or expect
                                        callers. In answer to our<pb n="316"/> knock we heard the patter of a child's feet on the hall
                                        floor and Susie opened the door. As good fortune would have
                                        it, the sitting-room door at the other end of the hall stood
                                        invitingly open, and so, without waiting for ceremony, I
                                        pushed right forward to the common room, which a great
                                        blazing wood fire illuminated so thoroughly that the candles
                                        were hardly necessary. Mrs. Hardcap started in dismay to
                                        gather up her basket of stockings, but on my positive
                                        assurance that we should leave forthwith if she stopped her
                                        work she sat down to it again. Luckily the night was cold
                                        and there was no fire in the stove of the cheerless and
                                        inhospitable parlor. So they were fain to let us share with
                                        them the cheery blaze of the cozy sitting-room. We did not
                                        start out till after seven, and we had not been in the room
                                        more than ten minutes before the old-fashioned clock in the
                                        corner rang out the departure of the hour and ushered in
                                        eight o'clock—whereat James laid aside his book,
                                        and at a signal from his father brought him the family
                                        Bible.</p>
            <p>"We always have family prayers at eight o'clock," said Mr.
                                        Hardcap, "before the children<pb n="317"/> go to bed; and I never let anything
                                        interfere with it."</p>
            <p>This in the tone of a defiant martyr; as one under the impression
                                        that we were living in the middle ages and that I was an
                                        Inquisitor ready to march the united family to the stake on
                                        the satisfactory evidence that the reading of the Bible was
                                        maintained in it.</p>
            <p>I begged him to proceed, and he did so, the defiant spirit a
                                        little mollified.</p>
            <p>He opened at a mark somewhere in Numbers. It was a chapter
                                        devoted to the names of the tribes and their families. Poor
                                        Mr. Hardcap! If he was defiant at the first threatening of
                                        martyrdom, he endured the infliction of the torture with a
                                        resolute bravery worthy of a covenanter. The extent to which
                                        he became entangled in those names, the new baptism they
                                        received at his hands, the singular contortions of which he
                                        proved himself capable in reproducing them, the
                                        extraordinary and entirely novel methods of pronunciation
                                        which he evolved for that occasion, and the heroic bravery
                                        with which he struggled through, awoke my keenest
                                        sympathies. Words which he fought and<pb n="318"/> vanquished in the
                                        first paragraph rose in rebellion in a second to be fought
                                        and vanquished yet again. The chapter at length drew to an
                                        end. I saw to my infinite relief that he was at last
                                        emerging from this interminable feast of names. What was my
                                        horror to see him turn the page and enter with fresh zeal
                                        upon the conquest of a second chapter.</p>
            <p>Little Charlie (five years old) was sound asleep in his mother's
                                        arms. Her eyes were fixed on vacancy and her mind interiorly
                                        calculating something. I wondered not that James snored
                                        audibly on the sofa. Susie never took her eyes off her
                                        father, but sat as one that watches to see how a task is
                                        done. My wife listened for a little while with averted face,
                                        then wandered off, as she afterwards told me, to a mental
                                        calculation of her resources and expenses for the next
                                        month. And still Mr. Hardcap rolled out those census tables
                                        of Judea's ancient history. It was not till he had finished
                                        three chapters that at length he closed the book and invited
                                        me to lead in prayer.</p>
            <p>Half an hour later, after Jamie had been roused up from his
                                        corner of the sofa and sent<pb n="319"/> off to bed, and Charlie had been
                                        undressed and put to bed without being more than half
                                        aroused, Mrs. Hardcap asked my advice as to this method of
                                        reading the Bible.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Hardcap," said she, "read a statement the other day to the
                                        effect that by reading three chapters every day and five on
                                        Sunday he could finish the Bible in a year. And he is going
                                        through it in regular course. But I sometimes doubt whether
                                        that is the best way. I am sure our children do not take the
                                        interest in it which they ought to; and I am afraid those
                                        chapters of hard names do not always profit me."</p>
            <p>The martyr in Mr. Hardcap re-asserted itself.</p>
            <p>"All Scripture," said he solemnly, "is given by inspiration of
                                        God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
                                        correction and for instruction in righteousness. We cannot
                                        afford to pass by any part of the word of God."</p>
            <p>"What do you think about it, Mr. Laicus?" said Mrs. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>"Think!" said I; "I should be afraid to say what I think lest
                                        your husband should account me a hopeless and irreclaimable
                                        unbeliever."</p>
            <pb n="320"/>
            <p>"Speak out," said Mr. Hardcap; "as one who at the stake should
                                        say, 'pile the fuel on the flame, and try my constancy to
                                        its utmost.' "Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is
                                        freedom."</p>
            <p>"Well," said I, "if I were to speak out, I should say that this
                                        way of reading the Bible reminds me of the countryman who
                                        went to a city hotel and undertook to eat right down the
                                        bill of fare, supposing he ought not to call for fish till
                                        he had eaten every kind of soup. It is as if one being sick,
                                        should go to the apothecary's shop, and beginning on one
                                        side, go right down the store taking in due order every
                                        pill, potion, and powder, till he was cured—or
                                        killed."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap shook his head resolutely. "Is it not true," said he,
                                        "that all Scripture is profitable?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," said I, "but not that it is all equally profitable for all
                                        occasions. All the food on the table is profitable, but not
                                        to be eaten at one meal. All the medicine in the
                                        apothecary's shop is profitable, but not for the same
                                        disease."</p>
            <p>"There is another thing," said Mrs. Hardcap,<pb n="321"/> "that I cannot help
                                        being doubtful about. James is learning the New Testament
                                        through as a punishment."</p>
            <p>"As a punishment!" I exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said she. "That is, Mr. Hardcap has given him the New
                                        Testament, and for his little offences about the house he
                                        allots him so many verses to learn; sometimes only ten or
                                        twelve, sometimes a whole chapter. I am afraid it will give
                                        the poor boy a distaste for the word of God."</p>
            <p>"There is no danger," said Mr. Hardcap, oracularly. "The word of
                                        God is sharper than a two edged sword, and is quick even to
                                        the dividing asunder of the joints and the marrow. It is the
                                        book to awaken conviction of sin, the proper book for the
                                        sinner. There is no book so fitting to bring him to a sense
                                        of his sinfulness and awaken in him a better mind."</p>
            <p>"And how," said I, "do you find it practically works? Does he
                                        seem to love his Bible?"</p>
            <p>"Says he hates it awfully," said his mother.</p>
            <p>"Such," said Mr. Hardcap, "is the dreadful depravity of the human
                                        heart. It is deceitful above all things, and desperately
                                        wicked."</p>
            <pb n="322"/>
            <p>It was quite idle to argue with Mr. Hardcap. We left him
                                        unconvinced, and I doubt not he is still reading his three
                                        chapters a day and five on Sunday. But I pity poor James
                                        from the bottom of my heart; and as my wife and I walked
                                        home I could not but help contrasting in my own mind Mr.
                                        Hardcap's way of reading the Bible and that which Deacon
                                        Goodsole pursues in his family.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
            <head type="sub">In Darkness.</head>
            <p>LAST Tuesday night Jennie met me at the station. It is unusual
                                        for her to do so. The surprise was a delightful one to me.
                                        But as I sat down beside her in the basket wagon she did not
                                        greet me as joyously as usual. Her mien was so sober that I
                                        asked her at once the question:</p>
            <p>"Jennie, what is the matter? You look sick."</p>
            <p>"I am sick, John," said she; "sick at heart. Willie Gear is
                                        dead."</p>
            <p>"Willie Gear dead!" I exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Jennie. "He was skating on the pond. I suppose this
                                        warm weather has weakened the ice. It gave way. Three of the
                                        boys went in together. The other two got out. But Willie was
                                        carried under the ice."</p>
            <p>Jennie was driving. Instead of turning up the hill from the depot
                                        she kept down the river road. "I thought you would want to
                                        go down<pb n="324"/> there at once," said
                                        she. "And so I left baby with Nell and came down for you."</p>
            <p>We rode along in silence. Willie Gear was his father's pride and
                                        pet. He was a noble boy. He inherited his mother's
                                        tenderness and patience, and with them his father's acute
                                        and questioning intellect. He was a curious combination of a
                                        natural skeptic and a natural believer. He had welcomed the
                                        first step toward converting our Bible-class into a mission
                                        Sabbath-school, and had done more than any one else to fill
                                        it up with boys from the Mill village. He was a great
                                        favorite with them all and their natural leader in village
                                        sports and games. There was no such skater or swimmer for
                                        his age as Willie Gear, and he was the champion ball-player
                                        of the village. But I remember him best as a Sabbath-school
                                        scholar. I can see even now his earnest upturned face and
                                        his large blue eyes, looking strait into his mother's
                                        answering gaze, and drinking in every word she uttered to
                                        that mission-class which he had gathered and which she every
                                        Sabbath taught. He was not very fortunate in his teacher in
                                        our own church Sabbath-school. For he took<pb n="325"/> nothing on trust and
                                        his teacher doubted nothing. I can easily imagine how his
                                        soul filled with indignation at the thought of Abraham's
                                        offering up his only son as a burnt sacrifice, and how with
                                        eager questioning he plied his father, unsatisfied himself
                                        with the assurances of one who had never experienced a like
                                        perplexity, and therefore did not know how to cure it.</p>
            <p>And Willie was really gone. Would it soften the father's heart
                                        and teach him the truth of Pascal's proverb that "The heart
                                        has reasons of its own that the reason knows not of;" or
                                        would it blot out the last remnant of faith, and leave Mr.
                                        Gear without a God as he had been without a Bible and
                                        without a Saviour?</p>
            <p>I was still pondering these problems, wildly thinking, not
                                        aimlessly, yet to no purpose, when we reached the familiar
                                        cottage. Is it indeed true that nature has no sympathy?
                                        There seemed to me to be on all around a hush that spoke of
                                        death. There needed no sorrowful symbol of crape upon the
                                        door; and there was none. I almost think I should have known
                                        that death was in the house had no one told me.</p>
            <pb n="326"/>
            <p>As I was fastening my horse Mr. Hardcap came up. We entered the
                                        gate together.</p>
            <p>"This is a hard experience for Mr. Gear," said I to Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>"The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether,"
                                        replied Mr. Hardcap, severely.</p>
            <p>I could feel Jennie tremble on my arm, but I made no response to
                                        Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear opened the door for us himself before we had time to
                                        knock. He was perfectly calm and self-possessed. Jennie said
                                        afterward she should not have guessed, to have seen him
                                        elsewhere, that he had even heard of Willie's death. But I
                                        noticed that he uttered no greeting. He motioned us into the
                                        sitting-room without a word.</p>
            <p>Here, on a sofa, lay, like a white statue, the form of the dear
                                        boy. By the side of the sofa sat the mother, her eyes red
                                        and swollen with much weeping. But the fierceness of sorrow
                                        had passed; and now she was almost as quiet as the boy whose
                                        sleep she seemed to watch; she was quite as pale.</p>
            <p>She rose to meet us as we entered, and<pb n="327"/> offered me her hand. Jennie put her
                                        arm around the poor mother's waist and kissed her tenderly.
                                        But still nothing was said.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap was the first to break the silence. "This is a solemn
                                        judgment," said he.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear made no reply.</p>
            <p>"I hope, my friend," continued Mr. Hardcap, "that you will heed
                                        the lesson God is a teachin' of you, and see how fearful a
                                        thing it is to have an unbeliev'n heart. God will not suffer
                                        us to rest in our sin of unbelief. If we lay up our
                                        treasures on earth where moth and rust doth corrupt, we must
                                        expect they will take to themselves wings and fly away."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap's horrible mutilation of Scripture had always
                                        impressed me in a singular manner. But I think its ludicrous
                                        side never so affected me before. What is it in me that
                                        makes me always appreciate most keenly the ludicrous in
                                        seasons of the greatest solemnity and distress? The
                                        absurdity of his misapplication of the sacred text mingled
                                        horribly with a sense of the insupportable anguish I knew he
                                        was causing. And yet I knew not how to interfere.</p>
            <p>"I hope he was prepared," said Mr. Hardcap.</p>
            <pb n="328"/>
            <p>"I hope so," said Mr. Gear quietly.</p>
            <p>"He was such a noble fellow," said Jennie to the weeping mother.
                                        She said it softly, but Mr. Hardcap's ears caught the
                                        expression.</p>
            <p>"Nobility, ma'am," said he, "isn't a savin' grace. It's a nateral
                                        virtoo. The question is, did he have the savin' grace of
                                        faith and repentance?"</p>
            <p>"I believe," said Mrs. Gear, earnestly, "that Willie was a
                                        Christian, if ever there was one, Mr. Hardcap."</p>
            <p>"He hadn't made no profession of religion you know, ma'am," said
                                        Mr. Hardcap. "And the heart is deceitful above all things
                                        and desperately wicked."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardcap is very fond of quoting that text. I wonder if he
                                        ever applies it to himself.</p>
            <p>"It seems kind o' strange now that he should be taken away so
                                        sudden like," continued Mr. Hardcap, "without any warnin'.
                                        And you know what the Scripture tells us. 'The wages of sin
                                        is death.'"</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear could keep silence no longer. "I wish then," said he
                                        hoarsely, "God would pay me my wages, and let me go."</p>
            <pb n="329"/>
            <p>"Oh! Thomas," said his wife appealingly. Then she went up to Mr.
                                        Hardcap, and laid her hand gently on his arm. "Mr. Hardcap,"
                                        said she, "it was very good of you to call on us in our
                                        sorrow. And I am sure that you want to comfort us, and do us
                                        good. But I don't believe my husband will get any good just
                                        now from what you have to say. We are stunned by the blow
                                        that came so suddenly, and must have a little time to
                                        recover from it. Would you feel offended if I asked you to
                                        go away and call again some other time?"</p>
            <p>"The word must be spoken in season and out of season," said Mr.
                                        Hardcap doggedly. Nevertheless he turned to leave. He
                                        offered his hand to Mr. Gear, who was leaning with his head
                                        upon his hand against the mantel-piece, and possibly did not
                                        notice the proffered salutation. At all events he never
                                        moved. Mr. Hardcap looked at him a moment, opened his mouth
                                        as if to speak, but apparently reconsidered his purpose, for
                                        he closed it again without speaking, and so left the room.
                                        Mrs. Gear went with him to the door, where I heard her ask
                                        him to pray for her and for her<pb n="330"/> husband, and where I
                                        heard him answer something about a sin unto death that could
                                        not be prayed for. Jennie followed Mrs. Gear softly out; and
                                        so Mr. Gear and I were left alone.</p>
            <p>Alone with the dead.</p>
            <p>"That's your Christian consolation," said Mr. Gear bitterly.</p>
            <p>"Is that just to your wife?" I answered him quietly.</p>
            <p>"No! It is not just to my wife," he replied. "I would give all I
                                        possess to have her faith. She is almost
                                        heart-broken,—and yet—yet—I
                                        who ought to sustain her would be crazed with grief if I had
                                        not her to lean upon. And she—she leans on I know
                                        not what. Oh! if I did but know."</p>

            <p>"He was such a noble boy," continued Mr. Gear speaking half to
                                        himself, and half to me. "He was so pure, so truthful, so
                                        chivalrous, so considerate of his mother's happiness and of
                                        mine. And he was beginning to teach me, teach me that I did
                                        not know all. I was afraid<pb n="331"/> of my own philosophy for him. I
                                        wanted him to have his mother's faith, though I never told
                                        him so. I never perplexed him with my own doubtings. I
                                        solved what I could of his, I was coming to believe little
                                        by little that there was a clearer, better light than that I
                                        walked in. I was hoping that he might find it and walk in
                                        it. I even dreamed, sometimes, to myself, that he would yet
                                        learn how to show it to me. And now he is gone, and the
                                        glimmer of light is gone, and the last hope for me is gone
                                        with him."</p>
            <p>"He is gone," I said softly, "to walk in that clearer, better
                                        light, and beckons you to follow."</p>
            <p>Mr. Gear made no answer, hardly seemed to note the interruption.</p>
            <p>"And this is the bitterness of the blow to me," he continued,
                                        still speaking half to me, half to himself. "I thought I
                                        believed in immortality. I thought I believed in God. These
                                        two beliefs at least were left me. And now nothing is left.
                                        My wife says 'he is not dead but sleepeth.' But I cannot see
                                        it. To me he is gone, for ever gone. If on the other side of
                                        that veil which hides him from me, that mystic something
                                        which we call his spirit still lingers, I do not see it.<pb n="332"/> I had a dream of
                                        that better land once and called it faith. But this cruel
                                        blow has wakened me, and the dream has passed in the very
                                        hour when I need it most. And nothing is left me; not even
                                        that poor vision."</p>
            <p>"Not even God?" said I softly.</p>
            <p>"Not even God," he answered with terrible deliberation. "For a
                                        bad God is worse than no God at all. And how can I believe
                                        that God is good? He looks down on our happy home. He looks
                                        on our dear boy, its life and joy. He knows how our life is
                                        wrapped up in him. He sees how little by little Willie is
                                        leading me up into a higher, happier, holier life. And then
                                        He strikes him down, and leaves my wife heart-broken, and me
                                        in darkness, bereft by one blow of my child and of my
                                        faith."</p>
            <p>Then he pointed to the dead boy who lay on the lounge before us.
                                        "How can I reconcile this with the love of God?" he cried.
                                        "How can you, Mr. Laicus?"</p>
            <p>All bitterness was gone now. He looked me earnestly in the eye,
                                        and asked eagerly, as one who longed for a solution, and yet
                                        was in despair of finding it.</p>
            <pb n="333"/>
            <p>"I cannot," I answered, "and dare not try. If I had only life's
                                        book to read, Mr. Gear, I should not believe in a God of
                                        love. I should turn Persian, and believe in two gods, one of
                                        love and good-will, one of hate and malice."</p>
            <p>He looked at me in questioning surprise.</p>
            <p>"Love, Mr. Gear, is its own demonstration. I <emph>know</emph>
                                        that God loves me."</p>
            <p>"How?" said he.</p>
            <p>"How?" said I. "Do you remember when we first met, Mr. Gear, that
                                        you told me your God was everywhere, in every brook, and
                                        mountain, and flower, and leaf, and storm, and ray of
                                        sunshine."</p>
            <p>He nodded his head reflectively, as one recalling a half
                                        forgotten conversation.</p>
            <p>"My God is in the hearts of those that seek Him," said I. "And in
                                        my heart I carry an assurance of His love that life cannot
                                        disturb. I know His love as the babe knows its mother's
                                        love, lying upon her breast. It knows her love though it
                                        neither understands her nature nor her ways."</p>
            <p>He shook his head sadly.</p>
            <pb n="334"/>
            <p>"Mr. Laicus," said he, "I believe you, but I do not comprehend
                                        you. I believe that you have a faith that is worth the
                                        having. I would give all I possess or ever possessed to
                                        share it with you in this hour. I do not know—I
                                        sometimes think it is only a pleasant dream. Would God I
                                        could sleep and dream such dreams."</p>
            <p>"It is no dream, Mr. Gear, but truth and soberness," said I. "A
                                        dream does not last through eighteen centuries, and raise
                                        half a world from barbarism to civilization. A dream does
                                        not carry mothers through such sorrows as this with
                                        outlooking anticipations so clear as those which give Mrs.
                                        Gear her radiant hope. No! Mr. Gear. It is you who have been
                                        dreaming, and life's sorrow has awakened you."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Laicus," he cried almost passionately, "I said I believed in
                                        nothing. But it is not true. I have no creed. I do not even
                                        believe in God or immortality any more. I have no God. I am
                                        without hope. But I believe in my wife. I believe in you. I
                                        believe that you and she have something—I know not
                                        what—that supports you in temptation and sustains
                                        you in sorrow. Tell me what it is. Tell me how I<pb n="335"/> may get it. I will cast
                                        my pride away. I would believe. Help my unbelief."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Gear," said I, laying my hand upon his arm, "here in the
                                        presence of this dear boy, be the solemn witness of your
                                        petition and your vow, will you kneel with me to ask of God
                                        what you have asked of me, but what He alone can give you,
                                        and record before Him the promise you have made to me, but
                                        which He alone can receive at your hands?"</p>
            <p>He made no answer—hesitated a moment—then
                                        knelt, with the dear boy's hand fast clasped in his, while
                                        kneeling at his side I echoed the prayer he had already
                                        uttered: "I believe; help Thou mine unbelief."</p>
            <p>And as we rose I saw the tears streaming down his softened face,
                                        the first tears he had shed since I had entered his house. I
                                        knew that Willie had taught him more in his death than by
                                        his life, and felt that now, to my own heart though not to
                                        his, I could answer the question he had asked me, "How can
                                        you reconcile this with the love of God?"</p>

                                        despair of utter skepticism?"</p>
            <p>"He is in good hands," said Mr. Mapleson, with calm assurance.</p>
            <p>"No! Mr. Mapleson," said I, "I can do nothing more with him. So
                                        long as I had only the intellect to deal with, I thought I
                                        knew what to say and when to keep silence. But I dare
                                        neither speak nor keep silence now."</p>
            <p>"I did not mean your hands," said Mr. Mapleson.</p>
            <p>"What then?" said I.</p>
            <p>"He is in God's hands," replied the pastor. "God has taken him
                                        out of your hands into His own. Leave him there."</p>
            <p>"Is there then nothing more to be done?" I said.</p>
            <pb n="337"/>
            <p>"Yes," said he, "but chiefly prayer."</p>
            <p>Then after a moment's pause he added: "I believe, Mr. Laicus, in
                                        the oft quoted and generally perverted promise: If two of
                                        you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they
                                        shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is
                                        in heaven. I believe it was intended for just such
                                        exigencies as this. It is not a general charter, but a
                                        special promise. Now is the time to plead it. Who beside
                                        yourself in our church is Mr. Gear's most intimate
                                        acquaintance and warmest friend?"</p>
            <p>I thought a moment before I answered. Then I replied, "To be
                                        honest, Mr. Mapleson, I do not believe there is one in the
                                        church who understands him. But Deacon Goodsole has had more
                                        to do with him than any other, and perhaps understands him
                                        better."</p>
            <p>"Very well," said Mr. Mapleson. "Will you meet Deacon Goodsole at
                                        my house to-morrow evening, half an hour before the
                                        prayer-meeting, to unite in special prayer for Mr. Gear? I
                                        will see the Deacon. I am sure he will come."</p>
            <p>"I am sure he will," I added warmly; "as sure as that I will be
                                        there myself."</p>
            <pb n="338"/>
            <p>With that I bade Mr. Mapleson good-night and hurried away. For
                                        tea had long been waiting, the children's bed hour was near,
                                        and Jennie was growing impatient to be at home.</p>
            <p>Wednesday evening Mr. Mapleson, the Deacon and I went into our
                                        church prayer-meeting from half an hour spent in Mr.
                                        Mapleson's study in prayer for Mr. Gear. Mr. Mapleson had
                                        seen Mr. Gear that morning. But the stricken father was very
                                        silent; he offered no communication; and Mr. Mapleson had
                                        pressed for none. I confess I had hoped much from Mr.
                                        Mapleson's interview, and I went into the prayer-meeting
                                        burdened and sorrowful.</p>
            <p>I think I have already remarked that Mr. Mapleson's conduct of a
                                        prayer-meeting is exceedingly simple. He seldom says much.
                                        He sets us all an example of brevity. A few words of
                                        Scripture, a few earnest words of his own or a simple
                                        prayer, usually constitute his sole contribution to the
                                        meeting, which is more truly a meeting for prayer than any
                                        other prayer-meeting I ever attended.</p>
            <p>That evening he seemed loath to open the meeting. We were little
                                        late in beginning.<pb n="339"/>
                                        When we did begin we were late in getting into the heart of
                                        it. He called on one after another to lead in prayer. I did
                                        not know but that he was going to omit the reading of
                                        Scripture and his own remarks altogether. Our prayer-meeting
                                        commences at half-past seven. The pastor never allows it to
                                        overrun an hour. And it was after eight when he arose to
                                        read. He read from the twelth
                                        chapter of Acts, the account of Peter's deliverance from
                                        prison. He read it from beginning to end without a comment,
                                        and then he spoke substantially as follows. His words were
                                        very simple. But that meeting has left an impression upon me
                                        that time will never obliterate. I believe I could repeat
                                        his words to my dying day.</p>
            <p>"A great deal is said and written," said he, "about the apostolic
                                        faith. But the apostles were men of like passions as we
                                        ourselves. They fought the same doubts. They prayed in the
                                        same hesitating, uncertain, unbelieving way. Peter was in
                                        prison. His friends could do nothing to effect his
                                        deliverance—nothing but pray. So they assembled
                                        for that purpose. They had the promise of the Lord, 'If two
                                                of<pb n="340"/> you
                                        shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall
                                        ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in
                                        Heaven.' But they did not believe it. They took some comfort
                                        in praying—as we do. But they did not expect any
                                        answer to their prayers. The thought that God might really
                                        afford deliverance never seems to have occurred to them. And
                                        when Peter, delivered by the angel of the Lord, came
                                        knocking at the gate of the house, and the startled
                                        disciples wondered what this midnight summons might mean,
                                        and the servant returned to report that Peter stood without,
                                        they laughed at her. You are mad, said they. And when he
                                        persisted in his knocking, and she in her assertion, they
                                        added with trembling and under-breath to one another, in
                                        mortal fear, "It is his ghost." Anything was more credible
                                        to their minds than that God should have answered their
                                        united prayers.</p>
            <p>"The promise of God is to the prayer of faith. But God is
                                        constantly better than his promise. He does not limit
                                        Himself by our expectations. He does exceedingly abundantly
                                        more than we can ask or even think. We are not therefore
                                                to<pb n="341"/> be driven
                                        from our knees by our want of faith. I hear men talk as
                                        though prayer were of no avail unless we believe beforehand
                                        with assurance that we were going to receive all for which
                                        we asked. It is not true. We are not heard for our much
                                        asking, nor for much our believing, but for God's great
                                        mercy's sake.</p>
            <p>"When the mission was first started at the Mill village, if I
                                        have understood aright, it was started on the application of
                                        the children themselves. They gathered around the
                                        school-house when the Bible-class assembled. They had no
                                        expectation of instruction. When the first person came to
                                        the door to invite them in, probably half of them scampered
                                        away in fright. Did they expect all that has come? Or would
                                        any Christian worker have said, 'They shall not have a
                                        Sabbath-school till they ask it, and believe that it will be
                                        provided for them?' And our Father does not wait for the
                                        prayer of faith. Like the father in the parable he comes
                                        while we are yet afar off. If we have faith enough to look
                                        wistfully and yearningly for a blessing, He has
                                        superabundant love to grant it."</p>

            <p>Mr. Mapleson is very fond of music. Singing is a feature of all
                                        our prayer-meetings. I have heard him say that he thought
                                        more people had been sung into the kingdom of heaven than
                                        were ever preached into it. Usually his rich voice carries
                                        the bass almost alone. But during<pb n="343"/> the singing of this hymn he sat
                                        silent, leaning his head upon his hand. This silence was so
                                        unusual that it almost oppressed the meeting. When the hymn
                                        closed there was a solemn hush, a strange expectancy; it
                                        seemed as though no one dared to break the sacred silence.</p>
            <p>Our lecture-room occupies half the basement of the church. I sat
                                        in a front seat, close by the little desk—a low
                                        platform furnished only with a light stand on which rests
                                        the minister hymn-book and a small Bible. The room was full,
                                        but it had filled up after I came in.</p>
            <p>The prolonged silence grew painful. Then I heard a rustle as of
                                        one rising to his feet. Then a voice; I startled, half
                                        turned round, restrained myself, thank God, and only cast on
                                        Jennie, at my side, a look of wonder and of thanksgiving.
                                        The voice was that of Mr. Gear.</p>
            <p>"Fellow-townsmen," said he,—he spoke hesitatingly at
                                        first as one unused to the place and the
                                        assemblage,—"I have come here to make a request.
                                        You are surprised to see me here. You will be more surprised
                                        to hear my request. I want to ask you to pray for me."</p>
            <p>He had recovered from his hesitancy now.<pb n="344"/> But he spoke with an
                                        unnatural rapidity as though he were afraid of breaking down
                                        altogether if he stopped a moment to reflect upon himself
                                        and his position.</p>
            <p>"You know me only as an infidel. I am an infidel. At least I was.
                                        Yes! I suppose I still am. My mother died when I was but a
                                        babe. My father brought me up. He was orthodox of the
                                        orthodox. But oh! he was a hard man. And he had a hard
                                        creed. I used to think the creed made the man. Lately I have
                                        thought perhaps the man made the creed. At all events both
                                        were hard. And I repudiated both. At fourteen I abhorred my
                                        father's creed. At eighteen I had left my father's roof. I
                                        have never returned except on occasional visits."</p>
            <p>He had gained more self-possession now, and spoke more slowly and
                                        distinctly. The room was as still as that room of death in
                                        which the evening before I had prayed with him, kneeling by
                                        the corpse of his little boy.</p>
            <p>"What I have been at Wheathedge you know. I cannot come here
                                        to-night on a false pretence. I cannot call myself a
                                        desperate sinner. I have wronged no man. I have lived<pb n="345"/> honestly and
                                        uprightly before you all. I owe no man anything. I have
                                        depended on my daily labor for my daily bread. Out of it I
                                        have provided as I had opportunity for the poor around me.
                                        No one ever went hungry from my door away. My creed has been
                                        a short and simple one, 'Do unto others as you would have
                                        others do unto you.' I have tried to live according to my
                                        creed.</p>
            <p>"But I begin to think that my creed is not all the truth. Mr.
                                        Laicus first led me to think so. No! my boy first led me to
                                        think so. I was satisfied with my creed for myself. But I
                                        was not satisfied with it for my boy.</p>
            <p>"Then I met Mr. Laicus. We commenced to study the Bible together.
                                        If he had attempted to prove my opinions wrong I would have
                                        defended them. But he did not. We studied the undoubted
                                        truth. The doubtful points he left alone. I learned there
                                        was more in the Bible, more in human life and the human
                                        heart than I had thought. I grew little by little sure that
                                        I had not all the truth. But I was unwilling to confess it.
                                        I was—yes, I was too proud.</p>
            <pb n="346"/>
            <p>"Yesterday"—his voice trembled and he spoke with
                                        difficulty for a moment, but quickly recovered
                                        himself—"yesterday we lost the light and life out
                                        of our house. No! I am wrong. My light was extinguished, and
                                        my life was quenched in death. But my wife's was not. The
                                        dear boy was as dear to her as he was to me. But she lives
                                        and hopes; I am in darkness and almost in despair. My
                                        father's hard creed drove me into infidelity. My wife's, my
                                        friend's tenderer and happier faith calls me back again. But
                                        I do not know the way.</p>
            <p>"Last night, kneeling by the side of my dear boy, I vowed that I
                                        would cast away my pride and seek that light in which my
                                        wife and my friends are walking. An hour ago the thought
                                        occurred to me—where seek it better than where
                                        they are gathered who are walking in this light? It seemed
                                        to me I could not come. But I had made the vow. I would not
                                        go back from it. I have cast away my pride. Oh! friends,
                                        help me to find that light in which you walk.</p>
            <p>"Do not misunderstand me. I will not have your prayers on false
                                        pretences. I am, if not still an infidel, at least an
                                        unbeliever. I have no<pb n="347"/> creed. I only believe that there is light somewhere, for
                                        others live in it. And I long to come into that light
                                        myself. Help me to find the way. And yet—I hardly
                                        know why I came here to-night. It was not for counsel. I do
                                        not want words now. The kindliest only pain me. Discussion
                                        and debate would arouse all the old devil of contradiction
                                        in me. Leave me alone. No! Do not leave me alone. Give me
                                        your prayers. Give me your Christian sympathies. But for the
                                        rest, for a little while, I want to be alone."</p>
            <p>He sat down. There was a moment of perfect stillness. Then the
                                        pastor arose.</p>
            <p>"Christ's sympathies are broader and His love is larger than we
                                        think," said he. "We hedge him round with our poor creeds,
                                        and shut Him up in our little churches, and think He works
                                        only in our appointed ways. He breaks over the barriers we
                                        put about him, and carries on His work of love in hearts
                                        that we think are beyond all reach of Him or us. We cannot
                                        tell our brother how to find the light. The light will find
                                        him. 'Jesus Christ is the light which lighteth every man
                                        that cometh into the world.'<pb n="348"/> And when the heart casts its pride away the light enters.
                                        For thus saith the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth
                                        eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
                                        place; with him also that is of a contrite and humble
                                        spirit, to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Into His
                                        hands let us commit our brother's spirit."</p>
            <p>And he poured forth his soul in a prayer which carried heavenward
                                        many an unbreathed cry for help, and received in the beating
                                        of many hearts a warmer, truer response than any spoken
                                        words could have given to it.</p>
            <p>After service I walked along with Maurice Mapleson.</p>
            <p>"I was never more astonished in my life," said I, "than when I
                                        heard Mr. Gear's voice in the prayer-meeting to-night."</p>
            <p>"I was not astonished," said Mr. Mapleson. "I went to that
                                        prayer-meeting sure that God had in store for us a better
                                        answer to our prayers than we had thought. I do not believe
                                        in presentiments; but I had a strange presentiment that Mr.
                                        Gear would come to our meeting to-night, that God would
                                        rebuke our<pb n="349"/> little
                                        faith by His unexpected answer. I even waited for Mr. Gear's
                                        coming. I saw him enter. I took that chapter of
                                        Acts—which God seemed to give me at the
                                        moment—partly that I might lead him on to fulfil
                                        the purpose which I fully believed had brought him there.
                                        While you were singing, I was praying. And when the hymn and
                                        the prayer were ended together, I knew God would not let him
                                        go away unblest."</p>
            <p>"I shall never again doubt," said I, "the truth of God's
                                        promise—'that if two of us shall agree on earth as
                                        touching anything they shall ask, it shall be done for
                                        them.'"</p>
            <p>"Shall you not?" said he, with a smile. "I wish I could be as
                                        sure for myself."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Retrospect.</head>
            <p>I am sitting in my library. The fire burns cheerily in the grate.
                                        A dear voice is singing sweetly by my side. For baby is
                                        restless to-night and Jennie has brought him down to rock
                                        him to sleep here and keep me company.</p>
            <p>The years pass in review before me. Thank God for the dear wife
                                        who three years ago persuaded me that I was a Christian more
                                        than a Congregationalist. The years have not been
                                        unfruitful. The work has been, oh! so little, and the
                                        harvest so great!</p>
            <p>I believe the whole church is satisfied with the result of our
                                        peculiar method of candidating. I am sure there is no one
                                        who would willingly exchange Mr. Mapleson for Mr. Uncannon.
                                        There have been rumors once or twice that<pb n="351"/> there was danger
                                        Maurice Mapleson would leave. He has twice had invitations
                                        to preach in city churches whose pulpits were vacant. But he
                                        has declined. "I hope," he says, "to live and die here. It
                                        is as God wills. But I have no ambition for a larger field
                                        of usefulness. It is all I can do to cultivate this field."</p>
            <p>My prophesy has proved true respecting Mr. Work. He has broken
                                        down, given up preaching, nominally because of a throat
                                        trouble; really, I believe, because of spirit trouble, and
                                        has opened a young ladies' school in one of the suburbs of
                                        the city. Mr. Uncannon has left North Bizzy after a year's
                                        pastorate, for one of the great cities of the West, where he
                                        is about equally famous for his fast horses, his good
                                        cigars, and his extraordinary pulpit pyrotechnics.</p><p>Maurice Mapleson's experiment has proved a complete success. Our
                                        church at last is out of its financial difficulties. We held
                                        our annual meeting last week. And here is the financial

            <p>The church has never before had a balance in its treasury, and it
                                        was bewildered with astonishment at the result. The money
                                        was really due to Maurice, who was to pay, the reader will
                                        recollect, the incidental expenses out of the monthly
                                        subscriptions and take the remainder as his salary. But
                                        Maurice positively refused to<pb n="353"/> take it. He, however, has long
                                        wanted the old pulpit cut down and a low platform
                                        substituted. The money was voted for that purpose, and the
                                        alterations are now going on.</p>
            <p>Though the pews are free, the pew system is not wholly abandoned.
                                        Each attendant selects a seat for himself or a pew for his
                                        family. This is regarded his as much as if he paid pew rent
                                        for it. But instead of a fixed rent he pays what he will. No
                                        one has paid less than the old rates and some have nearly
                                        doubled them. But the improvement in finances is not the
                                        only nor even the best result of Maurice Mapleson's
                                        experiment. The congregation has increased quite as much as
                                        the income. Not less than a score of families are regular
                                        attendants on our church who never went to church before.
                                        With one or two exceptions every pew is taken. We are
                                        beginning to talk quietly about an enlargement.</p>
            <p>I think this change had something to do with the revival last
                                        Spring. Maurice thinks so at all events. And any attempt to
                                        go back to the old system would meet with as much opposition
                                        from Deacon Goodsole as from Jim Wheaton.<pb n="354"/> The only member of
                                        the congregation who regrets the change is Mrs. Potiphar.
                                        She turns up her nose (metaphorically I mean—the
                                        natural nose is turned up all the time at that revival. "It
                                        did not reach any of our set," she says. "Why, bless you, I
                                        don't believe it added fifty dollars to the church income."</p>
            <p>One would think to hear her talk that Mrs. Potiphar supported the
                                        church. If she does, her right hand does not know what her
                                        left hand is doing.</p>
            <p>The immediate precursor of that revival was the prayer-meeting
                                        which Mr. Gear attended, and in which he asked the prayers
                                        of the church. When in June he stood up before the
                                        congregation to profess his faith in Christ as a Savior from
                                        sin, and in the Holy Spirit as a Divine Comforter in trial
                                        and in sorrow, he did not stand alone. Twenty-eight stood
                                        with him. Among them were nine of the boys from our Mill
                                        village Bible-class. Of that brightest of Sabbath days I
                                        cannot trust myself to speak. The tears come to my eyes, and
                                        my hand trembles as I write. I must pass on to other
                                        thoughts.</p>
            <pb n="355"/>
            <p>I have already explained how the Bible-class gathered to itself a
                                        second class of which Mrs. Gear took charge. Both classes
                                        have grown steadily, and latterly, rapidly, and are now
                                        beyond all that the most sanguine of us ever anticipated.
                                        There is a flourishing Sabbath-school at the Mill village.
                                        Mr. Gear superintends it. Nearly half of my old scholars are
                                        teachers now. But others have come to take their places. My
                                        own class is larger than ever. Once a month Mr. Mapleson
                                        preaches in the school-house, and in the summer his
                                        congregation overflows upon the green sward without. Once or
                                        twice he has been forced into the grove adjoining. It is
                                        evident that the old school-house will not serve us much
                                        longer. Mr. Gear is already revolving plans for the erection
                                        of a chapel. It seems to me rather chimerical. No! On second
                                        thoughts nothing seems to me chimerical any more. And as Mr.
                                        Gear and Miss Moore are both engaged in this enterprize, I
                                        am confident it will succeed.</p>
            <p>There is not in our church a more active, earnest, devoted
                                        Christian worker than Mr. Gear. He is one of the board of
                                        trustees, and about the only man on it who is not afraid
                                                of<pb n="356"/> Jim
                                        Wheaton. He rarely misses a prayer-meeting, and though he
                                        does not speak very often he never speaks unless he has
                                        something to say. And that is more than can be said of some
                                        of those who "occupy the time" in our prayer-meetings. I
                                        understand that Mr. Hardcap was not altogether satisfied
                                        with Mr. Gear's "evidences" when he appeared before the
                                        session. But if daily life affords the true "evidences" of
                                        Christian character, there are very few of us that might not
                                        be glad to exchange with Mr. Gear. I doubt whether Dr.
                                        Argure would think he was sound in the faith. And if the
                                        "faith" is synonymous with the Westminster Assembly's
                                        Confession of it, I do not believe he is. Deacon Goodsole
                                        has confidentially hinted to me his fear that Mr. Gear has
                                        some doubts concerning the doctrine of election; and that he
                                        is not quite clear even on the doctrine of eternal
                                        punishment. It is not impossible. But I do not believe there
                                        is a member of our church whose faith in a present,
                                        prayer-hearing God is stronger. His first step toward
                                        securing a chapel for the Sabbath-school has been taken
                                        already. It was a meeting of the <orig>Sabbath-</orig>
               <pb n="357"/> school teachers at his own house to
                                        pray for a chapel. And he builds on that prayer-meeting a
                                        strong assurance that he will get it. I do not think he is
                                        quite sound in the catechism. I wish I were as sound in the
                                        faith.</p>
            <p>I have often wished to know how he solved his old doubts. If I
                                        could find his specific for skepticism, I thought to myself,
                                        it would be of inestimable value to others. So with some
                                        hesitation, lest I should awaken the old unbelief, I asked
                                        him the question the other day.</p>
            <p>"How did you finally settle your old difficulties concerning
                                        Christian truth?" said I.</p>
            <p>"I never have," said he quietly. "They disappeared of themselves,
                                        as the snow disappears from Snow-cap when May comes."</p>
            <p>The fire burns low upon the hearth. The risen moon casts her soft
                                        light through the Eastern window and bathes the room with
                                        her radiance. The mountains, mist clad, stand as shadows of
                                        their daily self, more beautiful in their repose than in the
                                        full glory of the busy day. The baby sleeps quietly, nestled
                                        close to his mother's breast, too big I tell her for her<pb n="358"/> arms; but she protests
                                        I'm wrong. And still I sit, silent, and the past defiles
                                        before me.</p>
            <p>At length Jennie breaks the silence. "What are you pondering so
                                        deeply, John?"</p>
            <p>"I was thinking, Jennie, how much I owe the little woman who
                                        persuaded me to this dear home, who convinced me that I was,
