            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN the summer of 1848 the author of the following tale was a
passenger on board a
steamboat from New Orleans to Cincinnati. During the
passage—one of the most
prolonged and uncomfortable in the annals of western river
navigation—the plot of this
story was arranged. Many of its incidents, and all its descriptions
of steamboat life, will be
recognized by the voyager of the Mississippi.</p>
            <p>The tale was written before the appearance of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin,"—before negro
literature had become a mania in the community. It was not designed
to illustrate the evils or the
blessings of slavery. It is, as its title-page imports, a
<emph>tale</emph>; and the author has not
stepped out of his path to moralize upon Southern institutions, or
any other extraneous topic. But,
as its <emph>locale</emph> is the South, and its principal character
a slave, the story
incidentally portrays some features of slavery.</p>
            <p>With these explanations, the author submits the tale to the
public, hoping the reader will
derive some portion of the pleasure from its perusal which he
experienced in its preparation.</p>

            <p>ON the second floor of a lofty building in
—— street, New Orleans, was situated the office of
Anthony Maxwell, Esq.,
Attorney and Counsellor at Law, Commissioner for Georgia, Alabama,
and a dozen other states.
His office had not the usual dusty, business-like aspect of such
places, but presented more the
appearance of a gentleman's drawing-room; and, but for the ponderous
cases of books bound in
law-sheep, and a table covered with tin boxes and bundles of papers
secured with red tape, the
visitor would easily have mistaken it for such. The space on the
walls not occupied by
book-cases was hung with rich paintings, whose artistic beauty and
elevated themes betokened a
refined taste. The floor of the room was covered by a magnificent
tapestry carpet. The chairs,
lounges and tables, were of the most costly and elegant description.
The windows were hung
with graceful and brilliant draperies. Every arrangement of the
office betokened luxury and
indolence, rather than the severe toil and privation to which the
aspirant for legal honors must so
often submit. The costly appurtenances of the apartment seemed to
indicate that the young
lawyer's path to fame was over a velvet lawn, bedecked with beautiful
flowers, rather<pb n="8"/>
than the rough road, steep and crooked, over which the greatest
statesmen and most eminent
jurists have trodden.</p>
            <p>The occupant of this chamber was stretched at full length upon one
of the luxurious lounges,
puffing, with an abstracted air, a fragrant regalia. He was a young
man, not more than
five-and-twenty years of age, and what ladies of taste would have
styled decidedly handsome.
His face was pale, with a certain haggard appearance, which indicates
the earlier stages of
dissipation. His complexion was of a delicate white, unbrowned by the
southern sun, and the skin
was so transparent that the roots of his black beard were visible
beneath its surface. His jet-black
hair hung in rich, wavy curls, which seemed to be the especial care
of some renowned tonsorial
artist, so gracefully and accurately were they arranged. His black
eye was sharp and expressive
when his mind was excited in manly thought; but now it was a little
unsteady,—disposed
to droop, and wander, as though ashamed to express the emotions which
agitated his soul.
Altogether, his features were classic; but there was something about
them which the moralist
would not like—a sort of lascivious softness mingling with the
nobler intellectual
expression, that warned him to beware of the Siren, while he admired
the Apollo.</p>
            <p>The marks of vice were visible in his countenance. They had not
yet become canker-spots on
the surface, but they rankled and festered beneath that fair field of
physical and intellectual
grandeur.</p>
            <p>The young attorney was dressed in the extreme of fashion, yet in
good taste. Though he wore
all the fashion demanded, he did not court ridicule by overstepping
its flickering lines. He was
not the over-dressed dandy, but the full-dressed gentleman of refined
taste, in his external
appearance.</p>
            <p>Anthony Maxwell had been educated at a northern institution. A
year before his introduction
to the reader, he had entered his father's office in the capacity of
a partner, where,<pb n="9"/>
by an
assumed devotion to business, he had effectually deceived his father
and his clients into the
belief that he was a steady, industrious young man. His talents were
of a very respectable order,
which, superadded to a native eloquence and an engaging demeanor, had
enabled him to acquit
himself with much credit in the cases intrusted to his management. A
few months after his
professional début, his father's
decease had placed him in
possession of a very lucrative practice and a moderate fortune, thus
enabling him in some degree
to follow the bent of his own inclinations. To those whose habits and
desires were similar to his
own, he was not long in unfolding his true character, though not to a
sufficient extent to destroy
at once his professional prospects. The irresponsible life of the man
of leisure had more charms
to him than an honorable distinction in his profession. To labor in
any form he had an intolerable
repugnance. His fortune was not sufficient to allow an entire neglect
of business; therefore he
determined to practise law in an easy manner, until a rich wife, or
the "tricks" of his craft, would
permit an entire devotion to the pleasures of affluence.</p>
            <p>In accordance with this idea, his first step, after the death of
his father, had been to locate
himself in the magnificent apartments we have described. He gave up
the house in which his
father had dwelt, and, fitting up a sleeping-room in the rear of the
office with oriental splendor,
his life and habits were free from the scrutinizing gaze of friend
and foe, and he found himself
situated as nearly to his mind as his income would permit. These
indications of a dissolute life
were viewed with distrust by the more respectable of his clients. His
subsequent actions were not
calculated to increase their confidence; yet, for the respect they
bore to the father's memory, they
were slow in casting off the son.</p>
            <p>Mr. Maxwell smoked his cigar, and occasionally uttered an
impatient exclamation, as though
some scheme he was turning in his mind refused to accommodate itself
to his means. He was
evidently engaged in the consideration of some <orig>com-</orig>
               <pb n="10"/>
plicated affair; and the more he thought, the more impatient he grew.
He finished his cigar, and
lit another; still the knotty point was not conquered. His haggard
countenance at one moment
was lighted up, as though success had dawned upon his mental contest;
but at the next moment it
darkened into disappointment, which he vented in an audible oath.</p>
            <p>While thus laboring in his perplexity, the door communicating with
the ante-chamber was
opened, and the boy in attendance very formally announced "Miss Dumont."</p>
            <p>This announcement seemed to dissipate the vexatious clouds which
had environed the
attorney, and a light and cheerful smile came, as if by magic, upon
his care-worn features, as he
apologized to the lady for the smoky atmosphere of the room.</p>
            <p>"I trust your honored father is well," said he, after disposing of
the usual commonplace
introductions of conversation.</p>
            <p>"I regret to say that his failing health is the occasion of this
visit," replied the lady, in a cold
and even serious tone. "I have called to request your immediate
attendance at Bellevue. My
father has some business matters upon which he requires your
professional advice."</p>
            <p>"Col. Dumont, I trust, is not seriously ill," returned Maxwell,
with an appearance of
sympathy.</p>
            <p>"He is confined to his room, but not entirely to his bed. When
shall I say you will come?"
said the lady.</p>
            <p>"I will be there within an hour after your own arrival, if you go
direct."</p>
            <p>"Very well, sir;" and she turned to depart.</p>
            <p>This intention on the part of the lady did not seem to meet the
approbation of the attorney.</p>
            <p>"Stay a moment, Miss Dumont," said he, in an embarrassed manner;
"pray, honor me with a
moment's conversation."</p>
            <p>"Nay, sir. I know too well your object in this request, and cannot
accede to it," replied the
lady, in a firm and<pb n="11"/>
dignified manner, while a rich crimson shade suffused her beautiful
countenance.</p>
            <p>"Be not so unkind,—a moment is all I ask," said Maxwell,
with pleading earnestness.</p>
            <p>"No, sir; not a moment. Your unopened letter, which I yesterday
returned, should be enough
to convince you that my mind is not changed," replied she, moving to
the door.</p>
            <p>The lawyer was vexed. The letter alluded to by the lady he had
received, and it had troubled
him exceedingly. He had a great purpose in view,—a purpose
which, accomplished, would
enable him to realize the cherished object of his life,—would
enable him to revel in the
ease and affluence he so much coveted. Something must be done. Here
was an opportunity
afforded by the providential visit of Miss Dumont which might never
occur again, and he
resolved to improve it. Determined to detain her, he adopted the
first expedient which presented
itself.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," said he, "I have not received the letter, and was not
aware that you intended to
return it."</p>
            <p>"Indeed!" replied the lady, with evident astonishment, as she
relinquished her hold of the
door-handle, and returned to the table by the side of which the
attorney stood.</p>
            <p>"I regret that I did not, as it would have saved you from further
annoyance, and me from a
few of the hours of anguish with which I have awaited your reply,"
returned the lawyer, in
accents of humility, which were too well feigned to permit the lady
to suspect them. "The
bitterness of a blighted hope were better than the agony of suspense."</p>
            <p>A smile of pity and contempt rested upon the fair face of the
lady, as she turned her glance
from him to the papers on the table. There lay Maxwell's letter, with
the envelope in which she
had returned it! She only pointed to it, and looked into his face to
read the shame and confusion
her discovery must create.</p>
            <p>Maxwell's pallid cheek reddened, as he perceived that his<pb n="12"/>
deceit was exposed; but
he instantly recovered his self-possession, and said,</p>
            <p>"Pardon this little subterfuge. I permitted myself to descend to
it, that I might gain a
moment's time to plead with you for the heart which is wasting away
beneath your coldness. You
do not, you cannot, know the misery I have endured in possessing the
love upon which you so
cruelly frown."</p>
            <p>The passionate eloquence of Maxwell might have melted a heart less
firm than that of Emily
Dumont. As it was, the cold expression of contempt left her features,
and, if not disposed to
listen with favor to his suit, she was softened into pity for his
assumed misery. Under any other
circumstances, the lie he had a moment before uttered would have
forever condemned him in her
sight. But her charitable disposition compelled her to believe that
it was the last resort of a mind
on the verge of despair.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Maxwell," said she, "I am deeply grieved that you should have
suffered any
unhappiness on my account."</p>
            <p>"I will bless you for even those words," returned Maxwell,
hastily, feeling that he had gained
the first point.</p>
            <p>"But I do not intend to encourage your suit," promptly returned
the lady.</p>
            <p>"Be not again unkind! Veil not that heavenly sympathy in the
coldness of indifference
again!"</p>
            <p>"I wish not to be harsh, or unkind. You have before given me an
index of your sentiments,
and I have endeavored, by all courteous means, to discountenance them."</p>
            <p>"Yet I have always found something upon which to base a flickering
hope."</p>
            <p>"If you have, I regret it all the more."</p>
            <p>"Do not say so! Changed as has been your demeanor towards me, I
have dared to fan the
flame in my heart, till now it is a raging fire, and beyond my control."</p>
            <p>"I cannot give my hand where my heart is uninterested," replied
the lady, feelingly. "I love
you not. I am candid,<pb n="13"/>
and plain, and I trust this unequivocal declaration will forever
terminate any hope you have cherished in relation to this matter.
Painful as I now feel it must be
for you to hear, and painful as it is to me, on that account, to
declare it, I repeat—I can
never reciprocate the affection you profess. And now let this
interview terminate. It is too painful
to be prolonged;"—and she again moved towards the door.</p>
            <p>"Do not leave me to despair!" pleaded Maxwell, earnestly, as he
followed her toward the
door. "At least, bid me wait, bid me prove myself
worthy,—anything, but do not forever
extinguish the little star I have permitted to blaze in the firmament
of my heart—the star I
have dared to worship. Do not veil me in utter darkness!"</p>
            <p>"I can offer no hope—not the slightest, even to rid myself
of an annoyance," replied
Miss Dumont, with the return of some portion of her former dignity;
for the perseverance of the
attorney perplexed and troubled her exceedingly.</p>
            <p>"You know not to what a fate you doom me," said Maxwell, heedless
of the lady's rebuke.</p>
            <p>"There is no remedy;" and Miss Dumont grasped tho door-knob.</p>
            <p>"There is a remedy. Bid me wait a month, a year, any time, till
you examine more closely
your own heart. Give me any respite from hopeless misery."</p>
            <p>"You have my answer; and now I trust to your honor as a gentleman
to save me from further
annoyance," said Miss Dumont, with spirit, for her patience was fast
ebbing out.</p>
            <p>"I will not <emph>annoy</emph> you," replied Maxwell, with
emphasis, as he assumed an
air of more self-possession. "I have been pleading for exemption from
the direst of human
miseries. But I will not <emph>annoy</emph> you, even to save myself
from endless woe."</p>
            <p>"Forget this misplaced affection; for be assured my sentiments
will continue unchanged."</p>
            <p>"I can never forget it; but I will strive to endure it with<pb n="14"/>
resignation. I feel that I
must still cherish the presumptuous hope that you will yet relent."</p>
            <p>"Destroy not your own peace; for the hope must be a vain one.
Good-afternoon;" and the
lady departed before the attorney had time to add another
hyperbolical profession of a passion
which, however well acted, was not half so deeply grounded as he had
led the unsuspecting
object of it to believe. That he really loved her was to some extent
true. That his love was earnest
and pure, such as the blight of coldness and inconstancy would render
painful, was not
true,—far from it. He had sought her hand, not to lay at her
feet the offering of a hallowed
affection, but to realize the object we have before
mentioned,—to enable him, by the
possession of her vast wealth, to live a life of ease and pleasure.</p>
            <p>He had commenced his attack upon her affections with some prospect
of success. To the
occasional professional visit he paid her father he had added
frequent social calls, in which he
had used all his eloquence to enlist the sympathies of the fair
daughter. She had regarded him as
an agreeable visitor; and, indeed, his natural abilities, the
unceasing wit and liveliness of his
conversation, had well earned him this distinction. Flattering
himself that he should be able to
win her affections, he had gradually emerged from the indifference of
the mere formalist to the
incipient attentions of the devoted lover. These overtures were not
well received, and, if she had
before treated him with the favor which the agreeable visitor always
receives, she now extended
to him only the stately courtesy of entire indifference. The visible
change in the cordiality of her
receptions had opened his eyes, and revealed the nature of his
unpromising position. But his
disposition was too buoyant, his character too energetic, to allow
him to despair.</p>
            <p>Latterly, however, a new obstacle to his suit had presented
itself, in the person of a rival,
upon whom the object of his ambitious wishes appeared to bestow
unusual favor. This<pb n="15"/>
individual was a young officer in the army, a sort of protegé of the
lady's father, who had been spending a furlough at Bellevue. In the
matter of fortune Maxwell's
rival was not to be dreaded, for he knew the lady was not mercenary
in her views. The young
captain was penniless; but his family is good, and he had the
advantage of being a favorite with
the father. He had won for himself a name on the fields of Mexico,
which went far to enlist a
lady's favor. He was a universal favorite both with the public and in
the private circle.</p>
            <p>Maxwell considered this young officer a formidable rival, and he
resolved to retrieve himself
at once. Upon his personal attractions he relied to overcome the
lady's disfavor; and,
notwithstanding the unequivocal intention of discountenancing his
suit she had manifested, he
resolved to open his campaign by addressing her, eloquently and
tenderly, through the medium
of a letter. He felt that he could in this manner gain her attention
to his suit,—a point
which his vanity assured him was equivalent to a victory. But his
philosophy and his vanity were
both sorely tried by the return of the letter unopened. His point was
lost, and he was harassing his
fertile brain with vain attempts to suggest any scheme short of
honest, straight-forward
wooing,—which the circumstances seemed to interdict,—when
the visit of the lady
herself rendered further efforts useless.</p>
            <p>His position, resting, as it did, on the purpose of marrying the
heiress,—a purpose too
deeply incorporated with his future prospects to be
resigned,—was now a desperate one.
Through the long vista of struggles and difficulties he saw his end,
and the fact that he had to
some extent compromised his heart stimulated him still more to meet
and overcome the barriers
that environed him.</p>
            <p>For an hour after the lady's departure the young lawyer pondered
the obstacles which beset
him. With the aspect of an angry rather than a disappointed man, he
paced the office with rapid
and irregular strides. He could devise no expedient. A lady's will is
absolute, and he must bend in<pb n="16"/>
submission. He blamed his own tardiness one moment, and his
precipitancy the next;
then he cursed his ill luck, and vented his anger and disappointment
in a volley of oaths.</p>
            <p>His meditations were again interrupted, by his attendant's
announcement of "Mr. Dumont."</p>
            <p>"Ah, good-morning, sir! I was just on the point of going to
Bellevue. Nothing serious has
happened, I trust," said Maxwell, laying aside, with no apparent
effort, his troubled visage, and
assuming his usual bland demeanor.</p>
            <p>"Nothing," replied the visitor, gruffly.</p>
            <p>"Your niece left the office an hour since," continued Maxwell.
"She requested me
immediately to visit your brother."</p>
            <p>"Which you have not done," returned the visitor, whom we will
style Jaspar, to distinguish
him from his brother, Colonel Dumont.</p>
            <p>"But which I intend to do at once, a little matter having detained
me longer than I supposed it
would."</p>
            <p>"I will save you the trouble. The business upon which my brother
wished to see you was
concerning his will."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, sir! I hope he is not dangerously ill," said Maxwell, in
apparent alarm.</p>
            <p>"Not at all. The doctor says he will be out in a week; but he
thinks otherwise, and is now
engaged in putting his house in order," replied Jaspar, with a sickly
smile.</p>
            <p>"I am glad he is no worse, though it is better at all times to be
prepared for the final event."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps it is," said Jaspar, coldly. "Here is a rough draught of
the will, which he wishes
reduced to the usual form with all possible haste. Will it take you long?"</p>
            <p>"An hour or two."</p>
            <p>"I will wait, then, as he requested me to bring you with me on my
return."</p>
            <p>"It shall be done with all possible haste. There are cigars, and
the morning papers. Pray make
yourself comfortable."</p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>Jaspar seated himself, and lit a cigar, without acknowledging his
host's courtesy,
while Maxwell applied himself to the task before him. The first part
of the will was speedily
written; but those parts which alluded to the testator's daughter,
foreshadowing the opulence that
awaited her, he could not so easily pass over. They were so strongly
suggestive of the fortunate
lot of him who should wed her, that he could scarcely proceed with
the work. An hour before,
she had veiled <emph>his</emph> prospects in darkness; now he was
preparing a will which
would, at no distant day, place her in possession of a princely
fortune. His mind was so firmly
fixed upon the attainment of this treasure that it refused to bend
itself to the task before him.</p>
            <p>Jaspar had finished his cigar, and began to be a little impatient.
Thrice he rose from his chair,
and looked over the lawyer's shoulder.</p>
            <p>"This is an important paper," said Maxwell, noticing Jaspar's
impatience, "and must be
executed with great care."</p>
            <p>"So it is; but the colonel may die before you get it done,"
observed Jaspar, coarsely, and with
a crafty smile, which was not unnoticed by the attorney.</p>
            <p>"O, no! I hope not," replied Maxwell, exhibiting the prototype of
Jaspar's smile.</p>
            <p>A smile! What is it? What volumes are conveyed in a single smile!
It is the magnetic
telegraph by which sympathetic hearts convey their untold and
unmentionable purposes. To the
anxious lover it is the bearer of the first tidings of joy. Long
before the heart dare resort to
coarse, material words, the smile carries the messages of affection.
To the villain it reveals the
sympathetic purposes of his according fiend. What the lead and line
are to the pilot, the smile, the
cunning, dissembling smile, is to the base mind. By means of it he
feels his way into the heart
and soul of his supposed prototype.</p>
            <p>Maxwell knew enough of human character to read correctly the
meaning of Jaspar's crafty
smile. The attorney had long<pb n="18"/>
known that he was cold and unfeeling, a bear in his
deportment, and sadly lacking in common integrity; but that he was
capable of bold and daring
villainy he had had no occasion to suspect. As he turned to the
document again, the base
character of the uncle came up for consideration in connection with
his suit to the niece. Might
not this circumstance open the way to the attainment of his grand purpose?</p>
            <p>But, while he considers, let us turn our attention to the
development of the history and
circumstances of the Dumont family.</p>

            <p>ON the right bank of the Mississippi river, a
few miles above New Orleans, was situated the plantation of Colonel
Dumont, which he had
chosen to designate by the expressive appellation of "Bellevue;"
though, it would seem, from the
level nature of the country, it could not have been chosen on account
of any fitness in the term.</p>
            <p>In territorial extent, in the number of slaves employed, and in
the quantity of sugar annually
produced, the plantation of Colonel Dumont was one of the most
important on the river. This
fact, added to the possession of immense estates in the city,
rendered its owner a man of no small
consequence in the vicinity. But, more than this, Colonel Dumont was
loved and respected for
his many good qualities of mind and heart. In the late war with
England he had served in the
army, and as an officer had won an enviable distinction for his
courage and his talents. Coming
unexpectedly into the possession of this estate by the death of an
uncle, he retired, at the close of
the war, from a profession to which a genuine patriotism alone had
invited him, and devoted
himself entirely to the improvement of his lands.</p>
            <p>Colonel Dumont had been married; but, after a single year of
happiness in the conjugal state,
his wife died, leaving him an only daughter in remembrance of her.
This child, at the<pb n="20"/>
opening of the tale, was within a few years of maturity,—the
image of her father's only
love,—not less fair, not less pure and good.</p>
            <p>Emily Dumont was a beautiful girl, fair as the lily, gentle as the
dove. She was of a medium
height, and of slender and graceful form. Her step was light and
elastic, and, if there was any
poetry in her light, elegant form, there was more in her easy,
fairy-like motion. Her features were
as daintily moulded as her form. Her eye was light blue, soft, and
beautifully expressive of a pure
heart. She was a little paler than the connoisseur in female
loveliness would demand in his ideal,
and her expression was a little inclined to sadness; but it was a
sadness—or rather a sweet
dignity—more winning than repulsive to the gazer.</p>
            <p>Emily Dumont, highly as fortune had favored her in the bestowal of
worldly goods and
personal beauty, was still more blessed in the gifts of an expansive
mind and a gentle heart; and
mind and heart had both been faithfully cultivated by the assiduous
care of her devoted father.
She was a true woman,—not a mere plaything to while away a
dandy's idle hours, not a
piece of tinsel to adorn the parlor of a nabob, but a true
woman,—one fitted by nature and
education to adorn all the varied scenes of life. Although brought
up in unclouded prosperity,
amid luxury and affluence, she was still prepared for the day of
adversity, if it should ever come.</p>
            <p>As the heiress of immense wealth, her hand was eagerly sought in
the aristocratic circle
around her; but thus far she had resisted all these attacks upon her
heart, and upon her
prospective riches. In the crowd of suitors who gathered around her
was Anthony Maxwell. In
the item of wealth his fortune was comparatively small; and in that
of a noble character, smaller
still. Emily could have forgiven him the want of the former, but the
latter was imperatively
demanded. At the young lawyer's return from the North, and on his
first appearance at the bar,
Emily had regarded him with<pb n="21"/>
more than ordinary attention. But, after the death of his
father, the reports which reached her ears of his dissolute habits
and inclinations caused her to
regard him with distrust. His wit, accomplishments and native
suavity, had procured him
admission into the circle of her more favored friends. But the report
of his vices had as promptly
produced his expulsion.</p>
            <p>The return of the army from Mexico brought with it the young
officer whom we have before
mentioned. The father of this young man had been a companion-in-arms
of Colonel Dumont, and
a strong friendship had grown up between the veterans. The tie was
severed only by the death of
the former, after a life of mercantile misfortunes, and finally of
utter ruin. At the period of the
father's insolvency and death, Henry Carroll, the son, was a cadet at
West Point, and was about
abandoning his chosen profession for the want of means, when Colonel
Dumont wrote him an
affectionate letter, offering all that he required to complete his
studies. This offer, coming from
one who had been a heavy loser by his father's bankruptcy, was highly
appreciated, and the
young student had allowed no false delicacy to prevent his acceptance
of the generous proposal,
though with a stipulation to repay all sums, with interest. Colonel
Dumont, in his regular summer
tour to the North, never failed to visit his young friend, whose
noble bearing and lofty principle
entirely won his heart, and he charged himself with a father's duty
towards him. A regular
correspondence was kept up between the self-constituted guardian and
his protegé; and the more the
former read the heart of the young man, the more
did he rejoice that he had befriended him. He read with mingled pride
and affection the repeated
instances of his daring courage and matchless skill which found their
way into the newspapers;
while the record of his humanity to a fallen foe contributed to swell
the tide of the old
gentleman's affection.</p>
            <p>On his return from Mexico, Henry's first care was to see<pb n="22"/>
his devoted friend and
guardian, and he accepted his pressing invitation to spend a month at
Bellevue.</p>
            <p>As an inmate of her father's family, he was, of course, a constant
companion of Emily. Her
radiant beauty had captivated his heart long ere the month had
expired; and he saw, or thought he
saw, in the heart of the fair girl, indications of a sympathetic
sentiment. In the rashness of his
warm blood he had allowed himself to cherish a lively hope that his
dawning love was not
entirely unrequited. He had seen that <emph>his</emph> bouquet was
more fondly cherished
than the offerings of others; that <emph>his</emph> hand, as she
alighted from the carriage, was
more gladly received than any other; that <emph>his</emph>
conversation never wearied her; in
short, there was in all their intercourse an unmistakable exponent of
feelings deeper than those of
common friendship.</p>
            <p>In the midst of this delighted existence,—while yet he
revelled in the pleasure of
loving and being loved,—there came to him, like a dark cloud
over a clear sky, the
unwelcome thought that it was wrong for him to entangle the
affections of his benefactor's
daughter. He was a beggar,—the object of her father's charity.
Her prospects were brilliant
and certain, and he felt that he had no right to mar or destroy them.
He knew that she would love
him none the less for his poverty; but, probably, her father had
already anticipated something
better than a beggar for his future son-in-law.</p>
            <p>Poor Captain Carroll! The modesty of true greatness of soul had
left unconsidered the
genuine nobility of the man. He thought not of the name he had won on
the field of
battle,—of the honorable wounds he bore as testimonials of his
devotion to his country.
He was poor, and, in the despondency which his position induced, he
attributed to wealth a value
which to the truly good it never possesses.</p>
            <p>He loved Emily, and his poverty seemed to shut him out from the
hallowed field to which his
heart fondly sought admission.</p>
            <pb n="23"/>
            <p>Henry Carroll was a high-minded man; he felt that to love the
daughter while the
father's views were unknown to him would be rank
ingratitude—and ingratitude towards
so good a man, so kind a benefactor, was repugnant to every principle
of his nature. There was
but one path open to him. If he could not help loving her, he could
strive to prevent the loved one
from squandering her affections where pain and sorrow might ensue.
They had often met but he
strove to believe, in his unwilling zeal, that their intimacy had not
yet resulted in an incurable
passion. She had as yet shown nothing that could not have resulted
from simple friendship. And
yet she had—the warm glow that adorned her cheek when she
received his flower, the
expressive glance of her soft eye as he assisted her to the carriage,
the sweet smile with which
she had always greeted him,—ah, no, these were not friendship!
He could not believe that
his affection was unreturned; it was too precious to remain
unacknowledged. The will and the
heart would not conform to each other. But his duty seemed plain, and
he did not hesitate to obey
its call, though it demanded a great sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The month to which he had limited his visit at Bellevue expired
about the period at which
our tale begins. Inclination prompted him to accept the pressing
invitation of Colonel Dumont to
prolong his stay; but, bitter as was the thought of parting from her
he loved, his nice sense of
honor compelled him to be firm in his purpose.</p>
            <p>The announcement of his intended departure to Emily, as they were
seated in the
drawing-room on the designated day, afforded him another evidence
that her heart was not
untouched. Her pale cheek grew paler, and the playful smile was
instantly dismissed.</p>
            <p>"So soon!" said she, scarcely able to conceal the tremulous
emotion which agitated her.</p>
            <p>"So soon! I have finished the month allotted to me,"<pb n="24"/>
replied Henry Carroll, with a
weak effort to appear gayer than he felt.</p>
            <p>"Allotted to you! And pray are you stinted in the length of your visit?"</p>
            <p>"My orders will not permit a longer stay, happy as I should be to
remain; and I have already
trespassed long on your hospitality."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, Henry, you have grown sensitive! You were not wont to
consider your visits a
trespass. Pray, have you not been regarded as one of the family?"</p>
            <p>"True, I have. I can never repay the debt of gratitude for the
many kindnesses I have received
at your good father's hands."</p>
            <p>"He has been a thousand times repaid by the honorable life you
have led,—by feeling
that the talents he has encouraged you to foster are now blessing the
world," replied Emily,
warmly; "so no more of your gratitude, if you please."</p>
            <p>"However lightly you, or your father, may regard my obligations to
him, I cannot view them
coldly."</p>
            <p>"Well, then, your presence here will give him more pleasure than
any other token of respect
you can bestow; and, I am sure, I should be rejoiced—that is to
say—that
is—I should be glad to have you stay longer, if you can be
contented," stammered Emily,
as her mantling blushes betrayed her confusion. Deception was not in
her nature, and, strive as
hard as she might, she must reveal her feelings.</p>
            <p>"I should be happier than it is possible for me to express in
remaining at Bellevue. My month
has passed away like a dream of pleasure,—so short it seemed
that time had staid his
wheels,—so joyous that earth seemed shorn of sorrow. You know
not how much I have
enjoyed the society of your father, and, pardon me, of yourself,"
returned Henry, scarcely less
confused than Emily.</p>
            <p>"I am glad to hear you say so," she replied, with some hesitation,
and fearful of exposing the
sentiment she was<pb n="25"/>
conscious of cherishing. "I have thought that, accustomed as you are
to the stirring life of the camp, you had grown tired of our quiet home."</p>
            <p>"You wrong me, Emily. I should never weary here; but was fearful
that I had already staid
too long," said Henry, in a sad tone, for he felt it most deeply,
though not in the sense that Emily
understood him.</p>
            <p>"Too long! Then you are weary of us, and I will not chide you for
bidding us adieu," said
Emily, with a glance of anxiety at Henry.</p>
            <p>"Nay, Miss Dumont, do not misinterpret my words. I am not weary, I
cannot be weary, of
Bellevue and its fair and good inmates."</p>
            <p>"Then what mean you by saying you have staid too long?"</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, I cannot tell why I said it; but I feel that I should
do wrong to prolong my stay,
however congenial to my feelings to do so," replied Henry, with the
most evident
embarrassment.</p>
            <p>"How strange you talk, Henry! What mystery is this?" said Emily,
to whom prudential
motives were unknown.</p>
            <p>"If it be a mystery, pray do not press me to unravel it, for I cannot."</p>
            <p>His resolution was fast giving way before the strength of his
love. He was sorely tempted to
throw himself at her and pour forth the acknowledgment of his
affection, which, he felt, would
be kindly received. It was a difficult position for a man of
sensitive feelings to be placed in, and
he felt it keenly. But the duty he owed to his benefactor seemed
imperative.</p>
            <p>Emily, on her part, was sadly bewildered by the strangeness of
Henry's words; but she had no
suspicion of the truth. If she had, perhaps, with a woman's
ingenuity, she had devised some plan
to extricate him from the dilemma. She was conscious of the strong
interest she felt in the man
before her; but the fact that she loved him was yet unrecognized. How
should it be? She was
unskilled in the <orig>subtle-</orig>
               <pb n="26"/>
ties even of her own heart. She
knew not the meaning of love yet. She was conscious of a grateful
sensation in her heart; but she
had yet to learn that this sensation was that called love in the
great world. She began to fear, in
her inability to account for Henry's strangeness in any other way,
that some secret sorrow
weighed heavily upon him.</p>
            <p>"I will not press you," said she, in a tone of affectionate
sympathy; "but, if you have any
sorrow which oppresses you, reveal it to my father, and take counsel
against it. My father's house
is your home,—at least, we have always endeavored to make it
so. Father has always
regarded you with the affection of a parent, and taught me to
consider you as a brother—"</p>
            <p>"A brother!" interrupted Henry, feeling that the relation of
brother and sister was too cold for
the warmth of his affection; but, instantly banishing the unworthy
thought, he continued,</p>
            <p>"And so, my pretty sister, you are for the first time entering
upon your sisterly relations?"</p>
            <p>"The first time! Have I not always given you evidence of a
sister's esteem?"</p>
            <p>"Pardon me. I only jested," said Henry, as the playful smile left
his countenance.</p>
            <p>"Do not jest upon serious things, Henry," replied Emily. "But,
brother, something troubles
you. You cannot deny it. You look so gloomy and sad, and must leave
us so suddenly."</p>
            <p>"Nay, my sweet sister,—since sister I am permitted to call
you,—you must
forgive me if I am obstinate just this once."</p>
            <p>"I will forgive your obstinacy because you desire it, and not
because I am satisfied. Do you
know, brother," said she, with a playful smile, "that I suspect you
are in love?"</p>
            <p>This raillery was intended to have been uttered with a pert
archness; but the crimson cheek
and tremulous lips entirely defeated the intention.</p>
            <p>"Fie, sister! You are jesting now, yourself," replied<pb n="27"/>
Henry, with what was
intended for a smile, but which, like his assailant's archness, was a
signal failure.</p>
            <p>Both parties were now in the most unfortunate position imaginable.
Neither dared to speak,
for fear of disclosing their emotions. Both felt the awkwardness of
the silence, and both felt the
danger of breaking it. Henry twirled the tassel of the window
drapery, and Emily twisted her
pocket-handkerchief into every conceivable shape. Henry was the first
to gather fortitude enough
to venture a remark.</p>
            <p>"I must leave you, sister, now that, for the first time, the
relation is acknowledged. I assure
you, however, that I appreciate the sisterly kindness you have always
lavished upon me. And I
shall always remember this visit as the happiest period of my life."</p>
            <p>"Then I may hope you will often repeat it," replied Emily, sadly.</p>
            <p>"However pleasant it would be for me to do so, I fear my duty will
be a barrier to my
inclination. My future post, you are aware, is Newport."</p>
            <p>"And you depart so suddenly, and then seem inclined to make your
absence perpetual! But
we shall see you where ever you are. We go to Newport this season, if
father's health will
permit," returned Emily, with a playful pout.</p>
            <p>"I would stay by you,—that is, I would stay at Bellevue
forever,—if my duty to
your father—I mean to my country—would permit," stammered
Henry, much
agitated, as he rose to depart.</p>
            <p>"I must go and bid farewell to your father," continued he, taking
her hand, which he
perceived trembled violently, in his own; "and I trust you will
remember your absent
brother—," kindly, he was about to say, but Emily, attempting
to rise, was overpowered
by the emotions which she had vainly striven to suppress, and sunk
back in a swoon.</p>
            <p>Henry summoned assistance, and applied the usual restoratives, but
he did not again venture
to address her; and, as<pb n="28"/>
her pale features exhibited signs of returning consciousness, he
hurried from the room.</p>
            <p>As the hour of his departure drew near, he bade an affectionate
farewell to Colonel Dumont,
who was confined to his room by illness. His kind friend used many
entreaties for him to prolong
his stay, but Henry pleaded his duty, and that the dying request of a
brother officer required him
to take a journey into Georgia, which would consume some three or
four weeks' time. He
intended to go to his future station by the way of the Mississippi,
and promised that, if any time
were left him on his return, he would again visit Bellevue. This,
however, he thought was
improbable.</p>
            <p>Colonel Dumont gave his protegé much good advice, and, as
his failing health had infected his usually cheerful spirits, he said
that they would probably meet
no more in this world. He frankly told him that he should remember
him in his will, and wished
him ever to regard Emily in the relation of a <emph>sister</emph>.</p>
            <p>This last wish seemed like a positive prohibition of the fond hope
he had cherished, of
regarding her in a nearer and more tender relation. He congratulated
himself on the decision with
which he had resisted the temptation to avow his love.</p>
            <p>This injunction of Emily's father could be interpreted in two
ways,—as a requirement
to preserve the present friendly relations, or as a prohibition
against his ever making her his wife.
The latter method of rendering his meaning seemed to him the most in
accordance with their
relative positions, and he was compelled to adopt it.</p>
            <p>After renewing his thanks to his benefactor, he took his leave
with a sad heart, and departed
from the mansion which contained his newly-found yet now rejected love.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the management of his estates, Colonel
Dumont had, for many years, been assisted by an only brother. This
brother was directly the
opposite of himself in character, in aims, in everything. Even in his
childhood this brother had
displayed a waywardness of disposition which gave the promise of much
evil in his future years.
As the seed sown so was the harvest. Parental instruction, counsel
and rebuke, were alike
unavailing, and he attained the years of manhood morose and
unsympathizing in his disposition,
avaricious and hard with his equals, and cruel and unjust towards his
inferiors. His selfish mind,
his low aims, and his tyrannical character, had long been preparing
him for deeds of villany and
injustice.</p>
            <p>In the earlier years of his life he had been a merchant in New
Orleans; but, being universally
detested for his meanness and duplicity, in a season of general panic
in the financial world he
was completely ruined, by the want of those kind offices which are so
freely interchanged in the
mercantile community. In this dilemma, he asked his brother's
assistance. Colonel Dumont
examined his affairs, and, considering his position in the community,
with the almost hopeless
embarrassment of his concerns, concluded that success under these
circumstances was
impossible. He frankly and kindly informed his brother of his
conclusion, and offered him a
share in his planting operations. His brother—Jaspar—<pb n="30"/>
was sorely
wounded in his pride by this reply. It generated in him a sentiment,
if not of malignity, at least of
hatred, and from that day he was his brother's enemy. Jaspar's
business was gone, and he never
allowed his spirit of revenge even to interfere with his interest; so
he availed himself of his
brother's offer.</p>
            <p>Colonel Dumont trusted much to the gentle influence of his family
circle to soften Jaspar's
moroseness, and infuse some principle of charity and love. But these
anticipations proved vain.
He was cold and taciturn. Business alone could call forth the display
of his energy, of which he
was possessed of a liberal share. The society of Emily and other
ladies he seemed to shun. The
gentle influence of domestic life seemed entirely wasted upon him.
Colonel Dumont was forced
to believe his brother a misanthrope, and no longer strove to soften
his character. Emily regarded
his coldness as his natural manner, and left him to the full
enjoyment of his eccentricity. Between
persons of such opposite dispositions there could be, of course, but
little sympathy, and that little
was entirely upon one side.</p>
            <p>The demon of Jaspar's nature displayed itself in the cane-field
and in the sugar-house, which
Colonel Dumont rarely visited, having intrusted the entire management
of the estate to him, his
own attention being occupied by the exterior business of the
plantation, and by his city
possessions. The poor negro, who was compelled to submit to cruel
usage and short fare, knew
Jaspar's nature better than uncle or niece. His advent among them had
been the era from which
they dated the life of misery they led—a life so different from
that they had been
accustomed to under the superintendence of the more Christian brother.</p>
            <p>Jaspar Dumont managed the "negro stock" in the true spirit of a
demon, and as such the
"hands" learned to regard him. Runaways, which, under the mild
management of his brother,
were rarely known, were common now; and<pb n="31"/>
almost the only amusement Jaspar knew
was to hunt them down with rifle and bloodhound.</p>
            <p>This state of things Colonel Dumont saw, but he did not appreciate
the reason of it. Himself a
rigid disciplinarian, he wished not to interfere, though the cruelty
of Jaspar pained his heart. His
failing health had latterly withdrawn his attention still more from
the plantation, and Jaspar drew
the reins the tighter when he saw that the humane eye was removed from him.</p>
            <p>Such was Jaspar Dumont, whom we left in Maxwell's office at the
close of our first chapter.</p>
            <p>On the day succeeding the departure of Henry Carroll, Colonel
Dumont felt himself much
weaker in body, and was fully impressed with the conviction that his
final sickness had laid its
hand upon him. To Emily he had not communicated these gloomy
forebodings, and she had
discovered no alarming symptoms in his illness. She had no suspicion
of the nature of her father's
business with Maxwell, and had borne his message to the attorney, as
she had often done before,
in her frequent visits to New Orleans, though on this occasion, as
may be supposed, she felt
much delicacy in doing so.</p>
            <p>In her absence Colonel Dumont had become more and more impressed
with the omens of a
speedy dissolution, and in his uneasiness had despatched Jaspar with
a draft of his intentions,
wishing the attorney to write the will in his office (where he could
have his authorities at hand),
and return with his brother.</p>
            <p>Maxwell considered the will and his own position, while Jaspar lit
another cigar. Each was
striving to penetrate the thoughts of the other, but neither had the
boldness to enter upon the
subject which occupied his mind. The lawyer wanted the lady and the
fortune, and he had an
undefined purpose of obtaining them through the agency of Jaspar, who
wanted only the fortune,
and had a decided anticipation of being able to retain the attorney
in his service. Neither knew<pb n="32"/>
the purposes of the other; but each wanted the assistance of the other.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, with an absent mind, perused and reperused the first page
of Colonel Dumont's
instructions. Without a purpose he turned the leaf, and his attention
was attracted by the name of
his formidable rival, Henry Carroll. He read, with astonishment, a
bequest to him of fifty
thousand dollars. If it needed anything to complete his discomfiture,
this was sufficient. He
began to think Colonel Dumont was in his dotage. He had scarcely
heard of Captain Carroll until
his return from Mexico, and now he was a legatee in the will of a
millionaire. With much anxiety
he completed the reading of the instructions, fearful that he should
find the young officer's name
in connection with Emily's. To his great relief he found no such
allusion, and again he applied
himself to the task of writing out the will.</p>
            <p>Jaspar smoked his cigar, glanced occasionally at the newspaper,
and stared out of the
window. He was evidently lost to all around him, in the workings of
his own mind. Now his
thoughts seemed to excite him, for his eye glared with an unusual
lustre, and his thin lips moved,
as if they would disclose the operations of his mind. "Will he do
it?" muttered he. "He shall do it,
or by —— he shall suffer! I have the means of compelling
him. I will use them."</p>
            <p>Apparently satisfied with his conclusion, he rose hastily and
approached the attorney. A
smooth smile—an unwonted expression on his
features—seemed to come on
demand. Again he looked over the lawyer's shoulder. He saw the name
of Henry Carroll, and his
former severe expression returned, and his frame was stirred by angry
emotions. A
half-suppressed oath did not escape the quick ear of the attorney,
and he turned to observe the
face of his companion. He read at a glance the dissatisfaction which
the will occasioned. The
reason was plain; and, with the intention of drawing out Jaspar's
views, he addressed him.</p>
            <p>"This Carroll is a lucky fellow," said he.</p>
            <pb n="33"/>
            <p>"The devil is always the luckiest fellow in the crowd," growled
Jaspar, with an
oath.</p>
            <p>"You are right, sir," returned Maxwell, pleased to see no better
feeling between his rival and
the uncle.</p>
            <p>"But who is this Carroll?" said he.</p>
            <p>"A hungry cub, whom the colonel has helped along in the world."</p>
            <p>"Well, he has proved himself a brave and skilful officer, and
reflects credit on your brother's
judgment in the selection of a protegé," returned Maxwell, adroitly.</p>
            <p>"The fellow is all well enough, for aught I know, but he has
wheedled the colonel out of fifty
thousand dollars, and I can never forgive him for that," said Jaspar,
in what was intended for a
playful tone, but which was designed as a "feeler" of the attorney's
conscience.</p>
            <p>"But there is still an immense property left, even after deducting
the liberal charitable
donations," said Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"There is, but where does it go to? That whining young cub has
divided a hundred thousand
with me, and the silly girl has the rest."</p>
            <p>"Which will eventually go into the hands of Captain
Carroll,—lucky dog, he!"
returned Maxwell, striving to provoke Jaspar still more.</p>
            <p>"What! what mean you, man?" said Jaspar, with a scowl, as he
caught a glimpse of the
attorney's meaning.</p>
            <p>"Is it possible, my dear sir," said Maxwell, laying down his pen,
and turning half round, "is it
possible you have not observed the intimacy which has grown up
between this Carroll and your
niece?"</p>
            <p>"Intimacy! what do you mean? Speak out! no equivocation!" said
Jaspar, almost fiercely.</p>
            <p>"Do you not see that she will yet be the wife of Captain Carroll?"</p>
            <p>Jaspar scowled, but said nothing. He had seen nothing from which
he could draw such an
inference, but he doubted not the information was correct.</p>
            <pb n="34"/>
            <p>"Well, well, it matters not. He may as well have it as she,"
muttered he. "This will
suits me not, and must be broken or altered."</p>
            <p>"It <emph>is</emph> hard upon you," said Maxwell, who had overheard Jaspar's
mutterings.</p>
            <p>"It is rather hard to be placed upon the same level with a
comparative stranger," replied
Jaspar, thoughtfully, after a long pause. He had not intended the
lawyer should hear his previous
remarks, and had reflected whether he should disown them, or pursue
the subject as thus opened.</p>
            <p>"Of course you will not mention the idle remark I made," continued
Jaspar, in a vein of
prudence. "My brother has an undoubted right to dispose of his
property as he pleases."</p>
            <p>"O, certainly. What transpires in my office is always regarded
with the strictest confidence,
whatever its nature, and however it affects any individual," replied
Maxwell, laying peculiar
emphasis on the latter clause.</p>
            <p>"That's right, always be secret," said Jaspar, without any of the
appearance of obligation for
the favor which the attorney expected to see.</p>
            <p>"I have secrets in my possession which would ruin some of the best
families in the State of
Louisiana."</p>
            <p>"Without doubt," replied Jaspar, coldly.</p>
            <p>The attorney resumed his writing, and pronounced in an audible
tone each sentence as he
committed it to the paper.</p>
            <p>"To my beloved brother—Jaspar Dumont—I give and
bequeath the sum of fifty
thousand dollars."</p>
            <p>These words, as intended, again fired Jaspar's passions.</p>
            <p>"Is there no remedy for this?" asked he, hastily.</p>
            <p>"No legal remedy," replied Maxwell, indifferently, as he continued
his task.</p>
            <p>"Is there any, legal or illegal?"</p>
            <p>"None that an honest man would be willing to resort to."</p>
            <p>"That any man would resort to?" and Jaspar was not a little
provoked at the attorney's moral
inferences.</p>
            <p>"I know of none."</p>
            <pb n="35"/>
            <p>"I do."</p>
            <p>"Then why do you not put it into operation before it is too late?
The will is now nearly
written."</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! man; you do not understand me. A bolder step than you are
thinking of."</p>
            <p>"Well, what do you wait for?"</p>
            <p>"I need assistance."</p>
            <p>"If I can afford you any aid, <emph>honorably</emph>, I shall be
most happy."</p>
            <p>"<emph>Honorably</emph>! What the devil do you mean by
<emph>honorably</emph>?"
said Jaspar, exasperated by this unexpected display of morality.</p>
            <p>"What do I mean by honorably? Why, anything which does not affect
the legal or moral
rights of others," replied Maxwell, a little touched by the seeking
reflection of Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Fudge! how long have you been so conscientious?" sneered Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"When a man has a reputation to make or break, it becomes him to
handle it with care."</p>
            <p>"Out upon you, man! <emph>Your</emph> reputation is not so fair,
that you need be so
tender of it," replied Jaspar, with some severity.</p>
            <p>"Sir!"</p>
            <p>"O, you needn't '<emph>sir</emph>' me! You have led me to commit
myself, and now
assume a virtue you possess not."</p>
            <p>"Sir, I value my reputation, and—"</p>
            <p>"Of course you do, but you would not sacrifice a fortune for it,"
interrupted Jaspar, easily
changing the tenor of the conversation.</p>
            <p>"I certainly would not stain it unnecessarily," replied Maxwell,
with a meaning smile, for he
saw the folly of attempting the "high flight" with Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Now you talk sensibly," said Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Dumont, it is useless to beat about the bush any longer; if
you have any proposition to
make, out with it at<pb n="36"/>
once; and if I cannot aid you, I will, at least, keep your secret."</p>
            <p>"Will you swear never to reveal what I shall propose?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, if paid for it," said Maxwell, frankly.</p>
            <p>"It is well. Now, I will put you in the way of making ten thousand
dollars, if you so will,"
said Jaspar, slapping the attorney on the back with a familiarity
which was likely to breed
contempt.</p>
            <p>This was a tempting offer, and Maxwell prepared to listen to the
proposition. He was aware
that it was some design upon the estate of Colonel Dumont, and he
inwardly resolved to be a
gainer by the operation, whether he joined in it or not. Jaspar
Dumont laid aside his sternness,
and disclosed his plot to Maxwell. It was, as may be supposed, a
nefarious scheme, and not only
intended to deprive Henry Carroll of his legacy, but also to
disinherit the heiress, and, cast a
stigma upon the character of his brother.</p>
            <p>The plot we will not here disclose. Maxwell listened attentively,
occasionally interrupting the
speaker, by asking for details, or pointing out dangers. But the foul
wrong intended towards her
for whom he entertained warmer sentiments than those of friendship
shocked even his hardened
sensibilities, and he strongly objected to its consummation. It would
also, by stripping her of her
broad lands, and stigmatizing her birth, render her undesirable as a
wife. But Jaspar was firm in
his purpose, and refused to listen to any other scheme. This one, he
contended, was the safest and
surest.</p>
            <p>"But it is a diabolical transaction," suggested Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"Call it what you will, it is the only one that will work well."</p>
            <p>Maxwell remained silent. He was studying to make this scheme
subservient to his own
purpose. He was obliged to confess to himself that his hopes with the
heiress were worse than
folly, and he judged that the execution of Jaspar's<pb n="37"/>
scheme would remove his rival. He
looked forward years, and saw his own purpose gained by means of
Jaspar's plan. It was true that
he and Jaspar both could not have her estates; but then Jaspar was a
villain, and it would be a
good service, at a convenient season, to be a traitor to him. His
plans were arranged, and he
determined to encourage his companion to proceed, though, at the same
time, to seem unwilling,
and to keep his own hands clean from all participation in it.</p>
            <p>After this long interval of silence, which Jaspar had endured with
patience, for he recognized
the truth of the saying, that "He who deliberates is damned," Maxwell said,</p>
            <p>"I cannot consent to stain my hands with such gross injustice."</p>
            <p>"You cannot!" sneered Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"It would ruin me."</p>
            <p>"It was part of my intention to keep the transaction a secret,"
said Jaspar, sarcastically.</p>
            <p>"Of course, and your confidence in me shall not be misplaced."</p>
            <p>Jaspar's fists were clenched, and a demoniacal expression rested
on his countenance, as he
said, savagely,</p>
            <p>"You know your own interest too well to do otherwise."</p>
            <p>"I am not to be intimidated," replied Maxwell, who despised his
companion most heartily,
and did not relish his tyrannical manner. "Your confidence, I repeat,
is safe. <emph>Honor</emph> will keep your secret,—threats will
not compel me to do so."</p>
            <p>"<emph>Honor</emph>! ha, ha, ha!" chuckled Jaspar. "Do you know,
Maxwell, that you are
a —— fool, to talk to me of your honor?"</p>
            <p>"Would you insult me, sir?" said Maxwell, with vehemence.</p>
            <p>"O, no, my fine fellow! <emph>Your</emph> honor!—ha, ha!"
returned Jaspar,
taking from his pocket a little slip of<pb n="38"/>
paper. "Look here, my <emph>honorable</emph> worthy, do you know
this check?"</p>
            <p>Maxwell's face assumed a livid hue, and a convulsive tremor passed
through his frame, as he
read the check. In a moment of temporary embarrassment he had been
tempted to forge the name
of Colonel Dumont to this check, for five hundred dollars, to
liquidate a debt of honor, not
doubting that he should be able to obtain it again before the day of
settlement at the bank, by
means of a dissolute teller, a boon companion at the gaming-table.
But Colonel Dumont, in
arranging his affairs for their final settlement, had sent Jaspar for
a statement of his bank account
at an unusual time. Jaspar, who, in the illness of his brother, had
managed all his business,
immediately discovered the forgery. Without disputing its
genuineness, he ascertained who had
presented it, and traced the deed to the attorney, and thus obtained
a hold upon him which was
peculiarly favorable to the execution of his great purpose.</p>
            <p>"You see I have not laid myself open to your fire without
fortifying my position," said
Jaspar, enjoying, with hearty relish, the discomfiture of the lawyer.
"Now, no more of <emph>honor</emph> to me. I have kept your secret
for my own interest, and now you will keep mine
from the same motive."</p>
            <p>"But I <emph>dare</emph> not do this thing," replied Maxwell,
keenly sensitive to the
weakness of his position; "I lack the ability."</p>
            <p>"You have signed the colonel's name once very well; perhaps you
can do it again," sneered
Jaspar, who had no mercy for an unwilling servant.</p>
            <p>"It will not be for your interest or mine that I should do it,"
returned Maxwell, determined, if
possible, to avoid committing himself.</p>
            <p>"Why not?" said Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"My frequent visits to Bellevue would subject me to suspicion. I
am known. Another would
not be suspected. If<pb n="39"/>
I clear myself, I shall clear you at the same time. I can procure a
person who will accomplish all in safety."</p>
            <p>"Think you I will trust another man in possession of the secret?"</p>
            <p>"I shall compromise my own safety by writing the will, as you propose."</p>
            <p>"True,—who is this person?"</p>
            <p>"His name is ——," and Maxwell hesitated; then a severe
coughing fit
apparently prevented his uttering the name—"his name is Antoine
De Guy."</p>
            <p>"Do I know him?"</p>
            <p>"You do, I think,—a kind of <emph>street</emph>
lawyer,—you must have
met him at the Exchange."</p>
            <p>"What looking man is he?"</p>
            <p>"About fifty years of age," replied Maxwell, more thoughtful than
the simple description of a
person would seem to require;—"rather corpulent, black hair and
whiskers, intermixed
with gray,—dresses old-fashioned, and always looks rusty."</p>
            <p>"I do not remember him,—De Guy—De Guy," said Jaspar,
musing; "no, I do
not know him. Are you confident he can be trusted?"</p>
            <p>"Perfectly confident. I pledge my own safety on his fidelity,"
replied Maxwell, not a little
satisfied at gaining his point,—for he had a point, and a
strong one, as the reader may yet
have occasion to know.</p>
            <p>"Very good,—I will inquire about him."</p>
            <p>"And expose us both!" replied Maxwell, in much alarm.</p>
            <p>"True,—on reflection, it would not be wise, and it would be
best for you and I not to
be seen together. But finish the will; the colonel will not relish
my long absence. A word more:
do not say anything about <emph>this</emph> will. The colonel has a
fancy to keep it secret,
and this fancy will be the salvation of our scheme."</p>
            <p>But we will not follow the conversation any further. The<pb n="40"/>
reader has obtained a
sufficient knowledge of these worthies from their own mouths, to
believe them capable of any
villany they may be called upon to perpetrate.</p>
            <p>The plot was further arranged in all its details. A meeting with
De Guy was fixed for the next
day, when all parties were to be prepared to act their parts.</p>

            <p>COLONEL DUMONT'S melancholy
forebodings proved to be too well grounded, for in ten days after the
departure of Henry Carroll
he breathed his last, not fully ripe in years, but mature in the
stature of a good man. His worldly
affairs had all been arranged, and with his mind at peace with God
and man he bade a final adieu
to his weeping daughter and dissembling brother, and calmly resigned
his spirit to its Author.</p>
            <p>The mansion of Colonel Dumont had been the abode of happiness.
Cheerfulness and
contentment—rare visitors at the home of opulence—dwelt
gracefully amid the
luxurious splendor of this house. But now a heavy stroke of
affliction had come upon the devoted
Emily. The ruthless hand of death had struck down her father in the
midst of prosperity and
happiness. She felt that she was alone in the world. Her
unsympathizing uncle seemed not to feel
the loss, but appeared even more cold and churlish than ever. She
could not expect from him the
offices of kindness and sympathy. She was an orphan, but not till she
was prepared to combat
with the trials of life. Recognizing the hand of Providence in this
visitation of the Angel of
Death, she bowed meekly and submissively to the Master Will, and was
even cheerful and happy
in her tears.</p>
            <p>It was about ten o'clock on the night succeeding the <orig>fune-</orig>
               <pb n="42"/>
ral of Colonel Dumont that a small canoe, containing a single
individual, touched at the
bank of the river near the now gloomy mansion. Leaping from the
canoe, which was nearly
swamped by the act, the person it had contained drew the frail bark
beyond the reach of the rapid
current, and ascended the steep bank. Following the smooth shell road
through the long vista of
negro huts, he reached the little grove of tropical trees which
surrounded the proprietary
mansion. Casting an anxious glance around him, to satisfy himself
that he was not watched, he
cautiously approached the only illuminated window on that side of the
house, upon which, after a
close scrutiny of the interior of the room, he gave several light
taps. This signal was answered by
Jaspar Dumont, who, with a word of caution, opened the window. The
stranger, with a light
spring which belied his apparent years, gained the interior of the
room, which was the library of
the late owner.</p>
            <p>The person who had thus obtained admission was the lawyer, Antoine
De Guy, whom
Maxwell had suggested as a fit agent for the execution of Jaspar's
scheme. He was certainly an
odd-looking man. His face was of a very dark red color, much like
that which is produced by the
united effects of exposure and intemperance, and was encircled by a
pair of black whiskers,
intermixed with gray. His cranium was ornamented with a huge mass of
the same parti-colored
hair. His fiery red nose was placed in strange contrast with a pair
of green spectacles, which
entirely concealed the color and expression of his eyes. His clothes
were of a most primitive cut,
and had probably been black once, but were now rusty and white from
long service. His form
was portly, a little inclined to corpulency. His hands were most
unprofessionally dirty; but this
might have been occasioned by contact with the canoe in his passage.
On one of his fingers
glittered a diamond ring, which, considering the lack of ornaments in
other respects, but ill
accorded with the apparent parsimony of the man. It might, however,
have been obtained in<pb n="43"/>
the way of trade, for Maxwell had hinted that he did business under
the sign of the
"three golden balls." He was apparently in the neighborhood of
five-and-forty, and looked like
the debauchee in the face, while his dress indicated the penurious
man of business.</p>
            <p>"Did any one see you?" asked Jaspar, whose teeth were chattering
with apprehension,
notwithstanding his natural boldness.</p>
            <p>"Not that I am aware of," replied De Guy, in a silky tone, which,
proceeding from such a
form, would have astonished the listener.</p>
            <p>"You met no one?" interrogated the anxious Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Not a soul! Everything was still."</p>
            <p>"Let us be sure of it. Step into this room for a moment. I will
see that all the servants have
retired," said Jaspar, pushing his confederate into an adjoining apartment.</p>
            <p>A light pull at the bell-rope brought to the library the
body-servant of the late planter.</p>
            <p>This "boy," who was known by the name of <emph>Hatchie</emph>, was
a mulatto. He
was about forty years of age, and, having never been reduced to labor
in the cane-fields, bore his
age remarkably well. He was about six feet in height, very stout
built, and was endowed with
immense physical strength. His brow was a little wrinkled, and his
head was a little bald upon the
top,—and these were the only evidences of his years. His
expression was that of great
intelligence. In his countenance there was a kind of humility, to
which his demeanor
corresponded, that might have resulted from his condition, or have
been inherent in his nature.
He was a man who, even in a land of slavery, would be instinctively
respected.</p>
            <p>He had been a great favorite with his late master, in whose family
he had spent the greater
part of his life. By being constantly in attendance upon him and his
guests, he had acquired a
much greater amount of information than is often found in those of
his condition. He could read
and write,<pb n="44"/>
and by his intelligence and singular fidelity had proved a valuable addition
to his master's household. Possessing his confidence, and regarded
more as a friend than a slave
by Emily, he was a privileged person in the house,—a confidence
which in no instance did
he abuse, and which in no degree abated his affection or his fidelity.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was not a phrenologist, but he had long ago acquired a
perfect knowledge of Jaspar's
character,—a knowledge which his master or Emily had never obtained.</p>
            <p>Hatchie considered Emily, now that her father was dead, as his own
especial charge, and he
watched over her, in the disparity of their stations, very much as a
faithful dog watches over a
child intrusted to its keeping. Towards her he entertained a
sentiment of the profoundest respect
as his mistress, and of parental affection as one who had grown up
under his eye.</p>
            <p>"Hatchie," said Jaspar, as the mulatto entered the library, "are
the hands all in?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, sir," replied Hatchie, whose penetrating mind detected the
tremulous quiver of Jaspar's
lip; "all in two hours ago, according to regulations."</p>
            <p>"All right, then. You can go to bed now."</p>
            <p>"Yes, sir," replied Hatchie, with his customary obeisance, as he
turned to depart.</p>
            <p>"Stay a moment. Go to Miss Emily, and get the keys of the
secretary," said Jaspar, with
assumed carelessness.</p>
            <p>Hatchie obeyed; and, suspecting something before, he was confirmed
in the opinion now,
and determined to watch. His suspicions of something—he knew
not what—had
been excited by seeing Maxwell in earnest consultation with Jaspar on
the day of the funeral. He
had, of course, no idea of the plots of the latter; but, in common
with all the "boys," he hated
Jaspar, and was willing to know more of his transactions. Giving the
keys to Jaspar, he left the
room, and heard the creaking of the bolt which fastened the door.</p>
            <pb n="45"/>
            <p>As soon as the servant had departed, Jaspar called his confederate from his
concealment.</p>
            <p>"Are you ready for business?" said he.</p>
            <p>"I am," replied De Guy, "as soon as you pay me the first
instalment. I can't take a single step
in the dark."</p>
            <p>"Here it is," and Jaspar took from his pocket the money. "Have you
the document?"</p>
            <p>"I have," replied De Guy, producing the fictitious will, which
Maxwell had drawn up in
conformity with the instructions of Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"And you are ready to affix the signature?" said Jaspar, who
appeared not to be in the
possession of his usual confidence. Few villains ever become so
hardened as never to tremble.</p>
            <p>"I am. I came for that purpose. Give me the genuine will, and I
will soon make this one so
near like it that the witnesses themselves shall not discover the
cheat," replied De Guy, with an
air of confidence.</p>
            <p>"You shall have it; but first read this to me. I do nothing blindly."</p>
            <p>The attorney, in his silky tones, read the paper through, and
Jaspar pronounced it correct in
every particular.</p>
            <p>"I see nothing in the way of entire success," said Jaspar, rubbing
his hands with delight at his
prospective fortune.</p>
            <p>"Nor I," replied De Guy, "except that these witnesses will deny
the substance of it."</p>
            <p>"How can they, when they know it not? The colonel, for some reason
or other, would not let
them read it or know its purport. Maxwell and myself are pledged to
secrecy. It is upon this fact
that I based the scheme."</p>
            <p>"But the will would not be worth a tittle in the law with such
witnesses."</p>
            <p>"Bah! the colonel knew no one would contest it. He did it at his
own risk."</p>
            <p>"But will they not contest <emph>your</emph> will?"</p>
            <p>"If they do, I shall find the means of proving what the<pb n="46"/>
document affirms, and my
case will then stand just as well. As a kind of assurance for the
witnesses my brother affixed a
character,—a kind of cabalistic design,—upon the will,
assuring them it was placed
on the will alone. You have a copy of this design?"</p>
            <p>"I have. Maxwell gave it to me, and I have practised till I can do
it to perfection. Your
brother had an odd way of doing business."</p>
            <p>"He had; but his oddity in this instance is a God-send."</p>
            <p>"But the <emph>other</emph> document, Mr. Dumont! My stay is
already too long!"</p>
            <p>Jaspar, taking the keys from the table, opened the secretary, and
took from a small iron safe
in the lower part of it a large packet, on which were several large
masses of wax bearing the
impress of Colonel Dumont's seal.</p>
            <p>"Now, De Guy," said he, "do your best."</p>
            <p>"Do not fear! I never yet saw a name I could not imitate."</p>
            <p>"So much the better; but be careful, I entreat you! Think how much
depends upon care!"</p>
            <p>"O, I can do it so nicely that your brother himself would not deny
it, if he should step out of
his grave!"</p>
            <p>"Silence, man!" said Jaspar, angrily, as a superstitious thrill of
terror crept through his veins.</p>
            <p>Jaspar took up the packet, and was about to snap the seals, when,
quicker than thought, the
window through which De Guy had entered flew open, and Hatchie leaped
into the room.
Without giving Jaspar or his accomplice time to recover from the
surprise of his sudden entrance,
he levelled a blow at the lawyer, and another at the perfidious
brother, which placed both in a
rather awkward position on the floor. Hatchie then seized the
envelope containing the will, and
made his escape in the manner he had entered, well knowing that
Jaspar would not hesitate to
take his life rather than be foiled in his purpose.</p>
            <p>The mulatto's blows produced no serious effect upon the<pb/>

                  <head>Hatchie knocking down De Guy and Jasper, and stealing

               <pb />
               <pb n="47"/>
heads of the two villains, and, recovering from the surprise and
shock the act had
occasioned, they lost not a moment in pursuing their assailant.
Hatchie directed his course to the
river, and scarcely a moment had elapsed before he heard the steps of
his pursuers. Leaping
down the bank, he ran along by the edge of the water, with the
intention of reaching a boat which
he knew was moored a few rods further down. In his flight, however,
he discovered the canoe in
which De Guy had arrived, and, casting it off, he paddled with
astonishing rapidity towards the
opposite shore.</p>
            <p>His pursuers reached the bank, and perceiving the canoe through
the darkness, Jaspar
discharged his rifle at it. A heavy splash followed the discharge.
The canoe appeared to float at
the mercy of the current. Jaspar and De Guy, satisfied that the
rifle-ball had done its work,
hastened down stream to a small point of land which projected into
the river, with the hope of
securing the canoe and the body of the slave, upon which they
expected to find the will. The
canoe was driven ashore, as they had anticipated; but it contained
not the objects for which they
sought. The corpse of Hatchie was nowhere to be found, though they
paddled about the river an
hour in search of it,—not that the body of the mulatto was of
any consequence, but in the
hope of obtaining the precious will.</p>
            <p>Here was a contingency for which Jaspar was wholly unprepared. The
original signature of
the will was not now available, and they must trust to luck for
accuracy in signing the false one.
There was little difficulty in this, as the will was known to have
been signed in the usual manner,
and the private character they had in their possession. Still Jaspar
felt that the original paper
afforded the surer means of deceiving the witnesses. They had before
intended to produce a
fac-simile, mechanically, of the original,—a purpose which
could not now be
accomplished. The witnesses were all friends of Colonel Dumont, and
they had various papers
signed by them from which to copy their signatures.</p>
            <pb n="48"/>
            <p>The worst, and to Jaspar's daring mind the only difficulty which
now presented
itself, was the fear that the body of Hatchie might be found, and the
genuine will thus brought to
light. After much reflection and consultation with De Guy, he
determined to risk all, to watch for
the body, and be prepared to overcome any obstacle which might be
presented. With this
conclusion they returned to the library. By the aid of old notes,
checks, and other papers, the
fictitious will was duly signed, the significant character affixed,
and the document enveloped so
as to exactly resemble the original packet.</p>
            <p>The whole transaction was so well performed that Jaspar retired to
his pillow confident of
success, to await the result on the morrow, when the will was to be read.</p>

            <p>THE morrow came. Emily was summoned to
the library, to hear the reading of her father's will. With her no
worldly consideration could
mitigate the deep grief that pervaded her heart. She derived her only
consolation from a purer,
higher source. She was a true mourner, and the acquisition of the
immense fortune of which she
was the heiress was not an event which could heal the wound in her
heart. She looked not
forward to the bright scenes of triumph and of conquest that awaited
her. She was not dazzled by
the brilliancy of the position to which wealth and an honorable name
entitled her. Such thoughts
never occurred to her. She did think of Henry Carroll; but not in the
proud situation to which her
wealth might elevate him, but as a pure heart that would beat in
unison with her own, that would
sympathize with her in her hour of sorrow; as one who would mingle
his tears with hers, over the
bier of a common parent. She was not sentimental in her love, nor in
her grief. Sighs and tears
with her were not a sentimental commodity,—an offering which
the boarding-school miss
makes alike at the altar of her love, or at the shrine of a dead
parent's memory. The desolation of
heart and home was not a trial which wealth and honors could adorn
with tinsel, and thus render
it desirable, or even tolerable!</p>
            <pb n="50"/>
            <p>Emily Dumont entered the library. The occasion was repugnant to
her feelings.
The unceremonious blending of dollars and cents with the revered name
of her father was
extremely painful to her sensibility. It seemed like a profanation of
his memory.</p>
            <p>Her uncle, Maxwell, the witnesses of the will, and several
others,—intimate friends of
the family,—were already there. On Jaspar's countenance were no
tell-tale traces of the
last night's villany. He looked gloomy and sorrowful. So thoroughly
had he schooled himself in
hypocrisy for this occasion, that the scene he knew would, in a few
minutes, transpire, had no
prophetic indications in his features. Like the tragedian who is
tranquil and unaffected in the
scene in which he knows his own death or triumph occurs, Jaspar was
calm, and his aspect even
sanctimonious.</p>
            <p>As Emily entered Maxwell tendered his sympathies in his usual
elegant manner, and so
touchingly did he allude to the death of her father that with much
difficulty she restrained a flood
of tears. The scene in the office, and the disfavor with which she
had lately regarded him, were
forgotten in his eloquence.</p>
            <p>After this courtesy to the daughter of his former patron, Maxwell
again seated himself, and
after briefly and formally stating the reasons of their meeting, to
which he added a short but
apparently very feeling eulogy of the deceased, he took the packet
from the safe, and proceeded
to break the seals.</p>
            <p>In his full and musical tones the attorney read the preliminary
parts of the instrument, and
then commenced upon the principal items of the will. First came
several legacies to charitable
institutions and to personal friends; after which was a legacy of ten
thousand dollars to Emily
Dumont, to be paid in Cincinnati by his brother. The testator further
declared <emph>that the
said Emily was manumitted</emph>, and should proceed under the
guidance of his brother to the
place designated for the payment of the legacy.</p>
            <p>Emily, who had scarcely heeded the provisions of the will<pb n="51"/>
until the mention of her
name attracted her attention, was, as may be supposed, somewhat
astonished to hear her own
name in connection with a legacy. She raised her sad eyes from the
floor, and heard the other
stipulations in regard to her. So utterly unexpected, so terribly
revolting, was the clause which
pronounced her a slave, that for a time she did not realize its awful
import. But the blank dismay
of her friends, the well-counterfeited surprise of Jaspar and
Maxwell, brought her to a painful
sense of her position. She attempted to rise, but in the act the
color forsook her face, and she sunk
back insensible. In this condition she was conveyed to her room.</p>
            <p>The attorney completed the reading of the will, though, after the
extraordinary incident
which had just occurred, but little attention was given him. The
witnesses at once recognized the
strange character, and acknowledged the signatures to be genuine.
Here, then, thought they, was
the reason why the provisions of the will had been concealed from
them. So impressed were they
with the apparent purpose of Colonel Dumont in throwing the veil of
secrecy over the contents of
his will, that the very strangeness of it seemed to confirm its
genuineness; and they did not
scrutinize it so closely as under other circumstances they probably
would have done.</p>
            <p>How often may a good motive be tortured, by the appearance of
evil, into the most
despicable criminality! Colonel Dumont in this will had devised large
sums of money to various
charitable institutions, and in the event of his life being
prolonged, did not wish to be painted at
and lauded for this act. True charity is modest, and Colonel Dumont
did not desire to see his
name blazoned forth to the world for doing that which he honestly and
religiously deemed his
duty.</p>
            <p>This modesty had favored Jaspar's plans. No one could now gainsay
the will he had invented;
and he felt strong in his position, especially after the witnesses
had assented to their signatures.</p>
            <p>Among the persons who had been present in the library<pb n="52"/>
was Mr. Faxon, an aged
and worthy clergyman. He had for many years been an intimate friend
of Colonel Dumont, and
was a legatee in his will to a liberal amount. A constant visitor in
the family, its spiritual adviser
and comforter, he had possessed the unlimited confidence of the late
planter and his daughter. To
him the whole clause relating to Emily seemed like a falsehood. Pure
and holy in his own
character, it was beyond his conception that a man of Colonel
Dumont's lofty and Christian
views could have lived so many years in the practice of this
deception. He had no means of
disproving the illegitimacy of Emily. The family had been unknown to
him at the period of her
birth. The house-servants, with the exception of Hatchie, were all
younger than Emily. Then, the
statement was made in the will, and was, therefore, the statement of
Colonel Dumont
himself,—for the genuineness of the will he did not call in
question. In accordance with
his general character, her father had manumitted her, and left her a
competence. From this clause
he inferred that her father intended to place her beyond the reach of
harm, and beyond the
possibility of ever being reduced to the degraded condition so often
the lot of the quadroon at the
South. He had not only given her freedom, but had provided for her
conveyance beyond the pale
of slavery. With these intentions, if she were in reality a slave,
Mr. Faxon could find no fault.
They were liberal in the extreme. But why had he, at this late
period, mentioned the stain upon
her birth. Why not let her live as he had educated her? These queries
were so easily answered
that the good clergyman could not condemn the dead on account of
them. If the daughter, then
she was the heiress; if not, legitimately, it would be injustice to
the brother.</p>
            <p>Mr. Faxon reasoned in this manner. He could not believe, even with
all the evidence before
him. There was a reasonable answer, apparently, to every objection he
could think of, and he
resolved to apply to Jaspar and Hatchie for more information. All
that Jaspar could say, or would
say, in<pb n="53"/>
answer to his interrogatories, was that his brother's wife had died in giving
birth to a dead child; and that Emily, who was the child of a
house-servant by him, had so
engaged his attention by her singular beauty that he had substituted
her for his own child. This
story, Jaspar said, his brother had told him in the strictest
confidence, many years before. Mr.
Faxon, appreciating the disappointment of a father with such a
sensitive nature as Colonel
Dumont, was willing to believe that Emily had been substituted to
supply in his affections the
place of the lost child; but that he should educate her as his own
child, and then cast her out from
the pale of society, was incredible!</p>
            <p>The evidence was so strong, he could see no escape from the
terrible conclusion that the
gentle being, to whom he had ministered in joy and in sorrow, was a
slave! It required a hard
struggle in his mind before he could reconcile himself to the
revolting truth. Her beautiful
character, built up mostly under his own supervision, he regarded
with peculiar pride. He was not
so bigoted, however, as to believe his labors lost, or even less
worthy, because bestowed, as it
now appeared, upon a slave. In heaven his labors would be just as
apparent in the quadroon as in
the noble-born lady.</p>
            <p>After the departure of the friends who had been summoned to the
reading of the will, and
whose stay had been prolonged by the melancholy interest they felt in
the unfortunate Emily, Mr.
Faxon requested to see her, and was shown to her room. She had just
been restored to
consciousness, by the assiduous efforts of her maids, as the good man
entered.</p>
            <p>"O Mr. Faxon!" sobbed Emily, but she could articulate no more. The
terrible reality of her
situation had entirely overcome her.</p>
            <p>"Be comforted, my dear child," said Mr. Faxon, affectionately,
taking her hand. "The ways of
Providence are mysterious, and we must bend humbly to our lot."</p>
            <p>"I will try to be resigned to my fate, terrible as it is," replied
Emily, looking at the minister
with a subdued <orig>expres-</orig>
               <pb n="54"/>
sion, while hot tears poured
down her cheeks. "You will not forsake me, if all others do!"</p>
            <p>"No, no, my dear child; it is my duty to wrestle with sorrow. I
have come to direct your
thoughts to that better world, where the distinctions of caste do not
exist."</p>
            <p>"O, that I could die!" murmured Emily, as a feeling of despair
crept to her mind.</p>
            <p>"Nay, child, you must not repine at the will of Heaven. In God's
own good time He will call
you hence."</p>
            <p>"I will not repine; but what a terrible life is before me!"</p>
            <p>"The future is wisely concealed from us. It is in the keeping of
the Almighty. He may have
many years of happiness and usefulness in store for you."</p>
            <p>"But I am an outcast now,—one whom all my former friends
will despise,—a
slave!" replied Emily, covering her face with her hands, and sobbing
convulsively.</p>
            <p>"Nay, be calm; do not give way to such bitter thoughts. This may
be a deception, though, to
be candid, I can scarcely see any reason to think so."</p>
            <p>Emily caught at the slight hope thus extended to her; her eyes
brightened, and a little color
returned to her pallid cheek.</p>
            <p>"Heaven send that it may prove so!" said she; "for I cannot
believe that he who taught me to
call him by the endearing name of father; who watched so tenderly
over my infancy, and guided
my youthful heart so faithfully; who, an hour before he died, called
me daughter, and blessed me
with his dying breath,—I cannot believe he has been so cruel to me!"</p>
            <p>"It seems scarcely possible; but, my child, the ways of Providence
are inscrutable. Whatever
afflictions visit us, they are ordered for our good. Trust in God, my
dear one, and all will yet be
well."</p>
            <p>"I will, I will! My father's and your good instructions shall not
be lost upon me, slave though
I am. <emph>Dear</emph> father," said she, and the tears blinded
her,—"I love his
memory<pb n="55"/>
still, though every word of this hated will were true. I ought not to repine,
whatever be my future lot. That he loved me as a daughter, I can
never doubt; that he never told
me I am a slave, I will forgive, for he meant it well."</p>
            <p>"I am glad to witness your Christian faith and patience in this
painful event. But, Emily, had
you no intimation or suspicion of this trial before?"</p>
            <p>"No, never, not the slightest," said Emily, wiping away the tears
which had gathered on her
cheeks.</p>
            <p>"See if you cannot call to mind some slight circumstance, which
you can now recognize as
such."</p>
            <p>Emily reflected a few moments, and then replied that she could not.</p>
            <p>"And your house-servants are all too young to remember as long ago
as your birth?"</p>
            <p>"All but Hatchie."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you had better send for him, and I will question him."</p>
            <p>"I will, and I pray that his knowledge may favor me."</p>
            <p>Emily sent one of the maids for Hatchie; but she returned in a few
moments, accompanied by
Jaspar, who, hearing her inquiries for the man his rifle-ball had
sent to the other world, had come
to prevent any injurious surmises.</p>
            <p>This man, Hatchie, had not escaped Jaspar's attention, in the
maturing of his plot; but, as in
some other of the particulars, he had trusted to the facilities of
the moment for the means of
silencing him. Being a man, it was not probable he could know much of
the events attending the
birth of Emily to his prejudice. If it should prove that he did, why,
it was an easy thing to get rid
of him. His rifle-ball or the slave-market were always available. But
Jaspar's good fortune had
smiled upon him, and he felt peculiarly happy, at this moment, in the
reflection that he was out of
the way, for he doubted not the object of Emily in sending for him.</p>
            <p>"Miss Emily," said Jaspar, in a tone of unwonted softness, "I am
sorry to say that your
father's favorite servant<pb n="56"/>
met with a sad mishap last night, of which I intended to have
informed you before, but have not had an opportunity."</p>
            <p>Emily's cheek again blanched, as she saw all hope in this quarter
cut off.</p>
            <p>"Poor Hatchie!" said she, as calmly as her excited feelings would
permit. "What was it,
Uncle Jaspar?"</p>
            <p>Jaspar's lip curled a little at the weakness which could feel for
a slave, and he commenced the
narrative he had concocted to account for the disappearance of Hatchie.</p>
            <p>"About eleven o'clock last night," said he, "as I was about to
retire, I heard a slight noise,
which appeared to proceed from the library. Knowing that you would
not be there at that hour, I
at once suspected that the river-thieves, who have grown so bold of
late, had broken into the
house. I seized my rifle, and when I opened the door the thief sprung
out at the open window. I
pursued him down the shell-road to the river; upon reaching which I
perceived him paddling a
canoe towards the opposite shore. I fired. A splash in the water
followed the discharge. The
canoe came ashore a short distance below, but the man was either
killed by the ball or drowned.
In the canoe I found a bundle of valuables, which had been stolen from the
library,—among them your father's watch."</p>
            <p>"But was this Hatchie? Are you quite sure it was Hatchie?" asked
Emily, with much anxiety;
for she felt keenly the loss of her slave-friend.</p>
            <p>"My investigations this morning proved it to be so. He is missing,
and the appearance of the
thief corresponded to his size and form. I am now satisfied, though I
did not suspect it at the
time, that he was the man upon whom I fired."</p>
            <p>"But Hatchie was always honest and faithful," said Emily.</p>
            <p>"So he was, and I must share your surprise," returned Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"There is a possibility that it was not he," suggested Mr. Faxon.</p>
            <pb n="57"/>
            <p>"There can be no doubt," said Jaspar, sharply. "The evidence is
conclusive."</p>
            <p>"No doubt!" repeated Mr. Faxon, with a penetrating glance into the
eye of Jaspar, whose
apparent anxiety to settle the question had roused his first
suspicion. "He was, if I mistake not,
the only servant of your household who was on the estate at the time
of Miss Dumont's birth?"</p>
            <p>"He was, I believe," replied Jaspar, with a coolness that belied
the anxiety within him.</p>
            <p>"Were you <emph>alone</emph> when you shot him, Mr. Dumont?" asked
the clergyman,
sternly.</p>
            <p>"I was alone. But allow me to ask, sir, by what right you question
me. I am not your pupil or
your servant," replied Jaspar, rather warmly, his natural testiness
getting the better of his
discretion.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, sir," replied the minister, in a tone of mock
humility. "Do not let my curiosity
affront you."</p>
            <p>"But it does affront me," said Jaspar, losing his temper at the
sarcastic manner of the other.
"Now, allow me to inquire your business with this girl."</p>
            <p>"I came in the discharge of my duty as a Christian minister, to
impart the consolations of
religion to this afflicted child of the church. Of course, my
business could not be with <emph>you</emph> in that capacity."</p>
            <p>"You seem to have departed very widely from your object," replied
Jaspar, with a sneer
which he always bestowed upon religious topics.</p>
            <p>"True, I have. This last blow upon poor Emily was so sudden and so
severe as to call forth a
remark, and even a question of the validity of the will."</p>
            <p>"Indeed!" replied Jaspar, with a nervous start; "you have the will
as her father left it."</p>
            <p>Uncle, you said my father's watch was stolen? Was it not in the
iron safe, with the other
articles?" asked Emily, timidly.</p>
            <p>"It was," replied Jaspar, coldly.</p>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p>"How did he open it?" interrogated Mr. Faxon, taking up the
suggestion of Emily.</p>
            <p>"Did Hatchie return the keys to you last night?" asked Jaspar of
Emily, promptly.</p>
            <p>"He did not," replied she. "I sent for them to put a note in its
place, and sent them back by
him immediately. The fellow stood by when I opened the safe, and must
have witnessed its
contents. You can judge how he opened it now," returned Jaspar, with
a sneer, well pleased that
he had foiled their inquiries.</p>
            <p>"You say that the canoe in which he was making his escape came
ashore. Where is it now?
No canoe belongs to the estate."</p>
            <p>"There is not," said Jaspar, uneasily.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps an examination of it will disclose something of the
robber, if not of the will."</p>
            <p>"So I thought this morning, and for this purpose went to the
river, but the canoe was not to be
found. I did not secure it last night, and probably it broke adrift
and went down," replied Jaspar,
whose ingenuity never deserted him.</p>
            <p>"Very likely," said the minister, with a kind of solemn sarcasm.
"This whole affair seems
more like romance than reality."</p>
            <p>"I cannot believe my father was so cruel," cried Emily, the tears
again coming to the relief of
her full heart.</p>
            <p>"Do you doubt the word of the witnesses, and the mark and
signature of your father?" said
Jaspar, fiercely with the intention of intimidating her.</p>
            <p>"No, no! but, Uncle—"</p>
            <p>"Call me not uncle again! I am no longer the uncle of the progeny
of my brother's slaves.
This cheat has already been continued too long."</p>
            <p>"I will not call you uncle, but hear me," replied Emily,
frightened at Jaspar's violence.</p>
            <p>"I will hear nothing more. You will prepare to leave for
Cincinnati next week. I will no
longer endure the <orig>pres-</orig>
               <pb n="59"/>
ence of one upon whom my
brother's bounty has been wasted. Have you no gratitude, girl?
Remember what you are!"</p>
            <p>With these cruel words Jaspar hurried out of the room, satisfied
that he had established his
position, and, at least, silenced Emily. The minister he regarded, as
he did all of his profession,
with contempt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Faxon and Emily had a long consultation upon the embarrassing
position of her who had
so lately been the envied heiress. The murder of the mulatto, the
conduct of Jaspar, and some
other circumstances, afforded ground to believe that the will was a
forgery. If such was the fact,
the minister was compelled to acknowledge that it was a deep-laid
plot. Everything seemed to aid
the conspirators; for he was satisfied, both from the wording and the
chirography of the will, that
Jaspar, whatever part he played, was assisted by others. There was
not the slightest clue by which
the mystery could be unravelled. If there was hope that the will was
a forgery, there was no
immediate prospect of proving it such.</p>
            <p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Faxon felt compelled to advise
obedience to the instructions
of the will. The journey to the North could do no harm, and was,
perhaps, advisable, under the
state of feeling which would follow the publicity of the will. Emily,
painful as it was to leave the
home of her childhood at such a time, acquiesced in the decision of
her clerical friend. But there
was a feeling in her heart that she was wronged,—that she
should go forth an exile from
her <emph>own</emph> Bellevue.</p>
            <p>On the following week, Jaspar and Emily proceeded to New Orleans,
in the family carriage,
to take a steamer for Cincinnati.</p>

            <p>IT was about the time of the events
related in the preceding chapters, at the close of a variable day, in
which the storm and sunshine
seemed to struggle for the ascendency, that a plain-looking,
home-made sort of man might have
been seen attempting to effect a safe transit of the steamboat levee
at New Orleans. This
personage was no other than Mr. Nathan Benson, commonly called at
home "Uncle Nathan." He
was one of the better class of New England farmers, an old bachelor,
well to do in the world, and
was now engaged in the laudable enterprise of seeing the country.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan, though he laid no claims to gentility in the popular
signification of the term,
was, nevertheless, a gentleman,—one of Nature's noblemen. He
was dressed scrupulously
neat in every particular, though a little too rustic to suit the
meridian of fashionable society. He
presented a very respectable figure, in spite of the fact that the
prevailing "mode" had not been
consulted in the fashioning of his garments. His coat was, without
doubt, made by some village
tailoress, for many of the graces with which the masculine artist
adorns his garments were
entirely wanting in those of our worthy farmer. His hat was two
inches too low in the crown, and
two inches too broad in the brim, for the style; still it was a
good-looking and a well-meaning
hat, for it preserved the owner's phiz from the burning rays of the<pb n="61"/>
sun much better than
the "mode" would have done. His boots, though round-toed and very
wide, were nicely polished
when he commenced the passage of the levee, but were now encased in a
thick coating of yellow
clay.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan was a medium-sized man, and preserved as much of
nature's grace as a man
can who has labored for five-and thirty years at the stubborn soil of
New England. His hair was
sandy, and his full, good-natured physiognomy was surrounded by a
huge pair of reddish
whiskers.</p>
            <p>The superficial, worldly-minded man would have deemed Uncle
Nathan's <emph>principles</emph> rather too ultra for common,
everyday use; but he, good soul, found no difficulty in
applying them to every action he performed. He was, to use a common
phrase, a "professor of
religion;" but, less technically, he was more than a professor, and
strove to live out the spirit of
truth and righteousness.</p>
            <p>After much difficulty, Uncle Nathan succeeded in effecting a safe
passage to the planking
which formed the landing for the boats. After a glance of vexation at
the soiled condition of his
boots (Uncle Nathan was a bachelor!), he commenced his search for an
upward-bound steamer,
for he was about to begin his homeward tour. Two columns of dense
black smoke, the hissing
noise of escaping steam, and the splashing paddles of a boat a short
distance down the stream,
attracted his attention, and towards her he directed his steps.
Approaching near enough to read
her name, he was not a little surprised to find the boat he had seen
advertised to start a week
before. Concluding, in his innocence, that some accident had detained
her, he hastened on board.
Entering the cabin, the scene which was there presented did not
exactly coincide with his ideas of
neatness or morality. Uncle Nathan had read descriptions of the
magnificence of Mississippi
steamers; but the Chalmetta (for this was the name of the boat) fell
far below them. Even the best
boats on the river he considered vastly inferior to the North River
and Sound steamers.</p>
            <pb n="62"/>
            <p>After a hasty survey of the Chalmetta's capability of making him
comfortable for a
week or more, he concluded to take passage in her for Cincinnati, and
accordingly he sought for
the captain. To his inquiries for that personage a thin,
cadaverous-looking man presented himself,
and drawled out a civil salutation.</p>
            <p>"How long afore you start, cap'n?" inquired Uncle Nathan.</p>
            <p>"We shall get off in about ten minutes," replied Captain Drawler.
"John," continued he,
turning to a waiter near him, with a wink, "tell the pilot to be all
ready, and ring the bell."</p>
            <p>"Why, gracious!" said Uncle Nathan, hastily, as the waiter dodged
into the pantry, "I shan't
have time to get my trunk down."</p>
            <p>"How far up do you go?" inquired Captain Drawler.</p>
            <p>"To Cincinnati, if you can carry me about right," replied Uncle
Nathan, with an eye to
business.</p>
            <p>"Well, as you are going clear through, I will wait a few minutes
for you," suggested the
captain.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan thought him very obliging, and after some little
"dickering" (for he had heard
that Western steamboats were not particularly uniform in their
charges), he engaged a passage,
applying to the bargain the trite principle that "no berth is secured
till paid for," which had been
reduced to writing, and occupied a conspicuous place in the cabin.
Without waiting to see the
berth he had paid for, he hastened to the hotel for the large hair
trunk, which contained his
travelling wardrobe.</p>
            <p>Our worthy farmer made it a point never to cause any one an
unnecessary inconvenience;
never to read the morning paper more than half an hour when an
impatient crowd was waiting to
see it; and never in his life stopped his five-cattle team in the
middle of a narrow,
much-frequented road, to the annoyance of others. So the captain did
not have to wait more than
five minutes beyond the stated time. Depositing his trunk upon a heap
of baggage in the cabin,
and turning<pb n="63"/>
with pious horror from the gaming-tables there, Uncle Nathan seated
himself in an arm-chair on the boiler deck, to await the departure of
the boat, and, in anticipation,
to feast his vision with the wonders of the Father of Waters. He
waited very long and very
patiently, for Uncle Nathan considered patience a cardinal virtue,
and strove manfully against
every feeling of uneasiness. The tongue of the huge bell over him at
intervals banged forth its
stunning cadence, the hissing steam let loose from its pent-up cells,
the water which the wheels
sent surging far up upon the levee, all were indications, to his
unsophisticated mind, of a speedy
departure.</p>
            <p>Two hours he waited, with the same exemplary patience; but still
the Chalmetta was a
fixture.</p>
            <p>Night came, and the music of the bell, and the steam, and the
surging water, ceased. Uncle
Nathan, thinking patience no longer a virtue, cardinal or secondary;
hastened to the captain, with
some appearance of indignation on his honest features. The worthy
officer very coolly informed
him that, owing to the non-arrival of the mail, he should be unable
to get off till the next
morning.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan uttered a very peculiar "O!" and, seemingly perfectly
satisfied with this
explanation, asked to be shown his berth. The captain consulted the
clerk, and the clerk consulted
the berth-book, which conveyed the astounding intelligence that the
berths were all taken!</p>
            <p>"All taken!" exclaimed Uncle Nathan, aghast. "Haven't I paid for one?"</p>
            <p>The gentlemanly clerk acknowledged that he <emph>had</emph> paid
for one, and kindly
offered him a mattress on the floor, assuring him that there would be
plenty of berths after the
boat got off.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan did not see how this could be, and was informed that
many berths taken were
not claimed.<ref>*</ref>
               <note place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>*Western steamers
seldom start at the time they
advertise, but wait until they are full of freight and passengers.
The latter are boarded on them
from the time they take passage, if they wish,—often a week or
ten days. Berths are often
engaged by "loafers," who eat and sleep on board, and grumble at the
detention, but who
suddenly decamp when the boat starts.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <pb n="64"/>
            <p>Contenting himself with this explanation, Uncle Nathan sought the
boiler deck
again, to obtain the only possible oblivion for his uneasiness in the
society of mongrel gentlemen
and monstrous mosquitos. Those who have been subjected to these
steamboat impositions will
readily perceive that Uncle Nathan was in no very agreeable state of
mind. He was, to a certain
extent, home-sick. There was something in his expectant state, and
something in the gloomy
aspect of the low city with its cheerless lights, in the damp
atmosphere and the clouds of
mosquitos, to produce a sigh for home and its joys. If any one had
hummed "Sweet Home" in his
ears, it would have brought the tears to his eyes. He thought of
everything connected with his
hallowed home: of the good-natured spinster who was his housekeeper,
and of the ten-acre lots
upon his farm; of the red steers and the gray mare; of the shaggy
watch-dog and the tabby-cat; of
home in all its minutiæ. Its familiar scenes visited him with a
vividness which added ten-fold to
their influence. He was as far abstracted as the mosquitos, which
gathered in swarms upon every
tenable spot of his flesh, would permit, when his meditations were
disturbed by the gentleman
who occupied the next chair. He wore the uniform of the army, and was
battling the mosquitos
with the smoke of a plantation cigar, which bore a very striking
resemblance to those rolls of the
weed vulgarly denominated "long nines."</p>
            <p>This gentleman was Henry Carroll, who had been in waiting three
days for the sailing of the
Chalmetta. On his return from Georgia he had not deemed it prudent to
visit Bellevue. Of the
startling events which had transpired there since his departure he
was in entire ignorance.</p>
            <p>"No prospect of getting off to-night, is there?" said he to Uncle
Nathan.</p>
            <pb n="65"/>
            <p>"Not the least," replied the latter. "The cap'n just told me the
mail hadn't come, so
he should have to wait till mornin'."</p>
            <p>Henry turned to Uncle Nathan rather sharply, to discover any
mischief which might lurk in
his expression. Perceiving that he looked perfectly sincere, and was
innocent of any intention to
quiz him, he merely uttered, in the most contemptuous tone, the
single word "Humbug!"</p>
            <p>"You seem a leetle out o' sorts," returned Uncle Nathan, piqued at
the coldness with which
his intelligence was received.</p>
            <p>"Well, sir, I think I have very good reason to be so," returned
Henry; "for I have lain about
this boat, like a dead dragoon, for three days, in suspense."</p>
            <p>"You don't say so!" responded Uncle Nathan, with interest. "When
did they tell you they
should start?"</p>
            <p>"The captain said in about ten minutes," answered Henry, with a smile.</p>
            <p>"Good gracious! he told me the same thing!" said Uncle Nathan,
astonished at the
coincidence.</p>
            <p>"But I knew he lied, when he said so; yet the boat seemed full of
passengers, and I did not
expect to wait so long."</p>
            <p>"Don't you think they will get started to-morrow?"</p>
            <p>"I cannot venture an opinion, having been so often deceived. The
captain is trying to get a
freight of soldiers on deck. The city is full of them now, returning
to their respective states."</p>
            <p>"Then he has taken me in most outrageously," said the New
Englander, with emphasis.</p>
            <p>"A very common occurrence, sir," replied Henry, who now explained
to his companion some
of the tricks of Western steamboat captains.</p>
            <p>"Is there no remedy?" asked Uncle Nathan, anxiously.</p>
            <p>"Certainly; you can go in the next boat, if you choose. I shall
take the 'Belle of the West,'
which I am pretty well<pb n="66"/>
assured will sail to-morrow, if this one does not. But I prefer
this, as many of my friends go in her."</p>
            <p>"But will they give you back your passage-money again?" asked the
economical Yankee.</p>
            <p>"I have not paid it yet," replied Henry, now understanding the
position of his fellow-traveller.</p>
            <p>"Then how did you secure a berth? The sign in the cabin says 'No
berth secured till paid for.'"</p>
            <p>"I see how it is. You have been dealing with these fellows as
though they were honest men."
He then explained that there is no security against imposition for
travellers who pay their passage
in advance, in case the boat gets aground, or the captain pleases to
detain them an unreasonable
time; that the "old stagers" never show their money till the trip is
up; and much more useful
information for the voyager on the Western rivers.</p>
            <p>"And I have no berth yet! The fellow promised me one when we got
off," said Uncle Nathan,
chopfallen; for, if any one is keenly sensitive to an imposition, the
Yankee is the man.</p>
            <p>"There you are lame again," replied Henry. "You may get one, and
you may not. As you
have paid your fare, you had better keep quiet, and to-morrow I will
assist you in securing your
rights."</p>
            <p>"Thank ye," replied Uncle Nathan, truly grateful for the kind
sympathy of the officer. "I had
no sort of idee that they played <emph>such</emph> tricks upon travellers."</p>
            <p>"Fact, sir; this New Orleans is said to be a very naughty place,"
returned Henry, amused at
the simplicity of his companion.</p>
            <p>"True as gospel!" ejaculated Uncle Nathan, fervently.</p>
            <p>"Have you been here long?"</p>
            <p>"Only about ten days; but I have seen more iniquity in that time
than I supposed the whole
airth contained."</p>
            <p>Henry smiled at the fervid utterance of his companion.</p>
            <p>"You are from the North, I perceive," said he.</p>
            <pb n="67"/>
            <p>"Yes, sir, I am from Brookville, State of Massachusetts, which,
thank the Lord, is a
long way from New Orleans!"</p>
            <p>"Still, there are some excellent people here," suggested Henry,
who had known and
appreciated Southern kindness and hospitality.</p>
            <p>"Well—yes—I suppose there is; but their morals and
religion are shockin'. It
made my blood run cold, and my hair stand on eend, to see a company
of soldiers marchin'
through the streets last Sabba' day, to the tune of 'Hail Columby;'
and then to think of balls and
theatres on the Lord's day night, really it's terrible. I wouldn't
live in sich a place for all the
world!"</p>
            <p>"Very different from New England, certainly," replied Henry,
good-naturedly, for it must be
confessed he was not so much shocked at these desecrations.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan discoursed long and eloquently on Sabbath-breaking,
gambling and
intemperance, which prevail to such an extent in the luxurious
metropolis of the
South,—as long, at least, as the patience of his new-found
military friend would permit.
At his suggestion they retired to a hotel for the night, for the
mosquitos were in undisturbed
possession of the Chalmetta.</p>

            <p>EARLY on the following
morning, Henry Carroll and Uncle Nathan were on board the Chalmetta,
ready and eager for a
start. But they were doomed to more disappointment. Nearly all day
the bell banged and the
steam hissed; the captain told a hundred lies, but the boat did not
budge an inch from her berth.
Still there were certain signs that the hour of departure could not
be far distant. Fresh provisions
and ice in unusually large quantities were received on board about
noon, and these are unfailing
prognostics of "a good time coming."</p>
            <p>At about five o'clock in the afternoon, the captain's ten minutes,
with which he had secured
an occasional fresh passenger, seemed actually to have expired. Our
two friends on board,
however, had been so often disappointed that they did not allow a
single bright anticipation to
enliven their hearts, till they actually heard the order given "to
cast off the fasts and haul in the
planks." And even then their hopes were instantly dampened by the
sudden reversion of the
order.</p>
            <p>This unexpected change had been produced in the mind of the
captain by seeing a splendid
equipage dashing at a furious pace across the levee, the driver of
which had, by his gestures,
made it appear that his vehicle contained passengers.</p>
            <pb n="69"/>
            <p>The carriage drew up opposite the boat, and Emily Dumont and Jaspar alighted
from it. Picking their way through the crowd of dealers in cigars,
shells, and obscene books, who
had just been ejected from the boat, they were soon on board. A few
moments' delay in getting
up the baggage of the new comers, and the welcome "cast off the fasts
and haul in the plank" was
again heard. The rapid jingling of the engineer's bell succeeded,
and, to the joy of some three
hundred souls on board, she backed out into the stream and commenced
her voyage. Uncle
Nathan breathed freely; the load of anxiety which had oppressed him
was removed. But his joy
was short-lived, for Henry Carroll informed him that the boat was
headed <emph>down</emph>
river!</p>
            <p>"What in all natur' can be the meanin' of this?" exclaimed our
Northerner, wofully perplexed.</p>
            <p>"I cannot tell," replied Henry; "but I am much afraid we shall yet
have to stay over Sunday in
New Orleans."</p>
            <p>"The Lord deliver me!" ejaculated Uncle Nathan. "I will go into
the swamp back of the city,
afore I will look upon the iniquities of that Sodom again."</p>
            <p>"Rather a hard penance; but let us first see what this movement
will amount to."</p>
            <p>At this moment Captain Drawler descended from the wheel-house, and
was immediately
besieged by a dozen angry passengers, who had resolved to lynch him,
or leave the
boat,—which he dreaded more,—if satisfaction was not given.</p>
            <p>The stoical captain, with perfect coolness, heard their complaints
and their threats. He waited
with commendable patience till they had vented their indignation, and
then informed them that
he only intended to receive a little freight at the lower city, which
would not detain him "ten
minutes."</p>
            <p>The captain's assertion, with the exception of the ten minutes,
was soon verified by the boat
touching at a sort of dépôt for naval and military
stores. The "<emph>freight</emph>" which the
<orig>Chal-</orig>
               <pb n="70"/>
metta was to take consisted of several long boxes,
which lay near the landing. These boxes contained coffins, in which
were the remains of some
sixteen officers, who had paid the debt of nature in the discharge of
their duties in Mexico.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll, with a melancholy heart, witnessed the process of
conveying these boxes to
the deck of the steamer. In them was all that remained of many stout
hearts, with whom, side by
side, he had marched to glory and victory. There were the forms with
whom he had triumphantly
mounted the battlements at Vera Cruz, and raised the stars and
stripes over the city of Mexico.
There, before him, forever silent, were the dead heroes of
Chepultepec and Perote. Those with
whom he had endured toils and hardships of no common
nature,—with whom he had
contended against a treacherous foe, and a more treacherous
climate,—were there
encoffined before him. They died in defence of their country's honor;
and he almost envied them
the death which wrote their names, subject to no future stain, upon
the roll of fame!</p>
            <p>The sight of these boxes, and a knowledge of their contents, also
awakened sad reflections in
the mind of Uncle Nathan. But his reflections were of a different
character from those of the
soldier. War he regarded as an unnecessary evil,—one which men
had no more right to
countenance than they had the deeds of the midnight assassin. The
honor of a nation were better
sacrificed than that the blood of innocent men should flow in its
support. He was a thorough
disciple of the peace movement. With such views as these, his
sympathies naturally reverted to
the dwelling of the departed hero; to the home rendered desolate by
the untimely death of a
father; to the circle which gathered in tears around the fire-side,
to deplore the loss of an
affectionate brother and son; to the widow and the orphan, whom war's
desolating hand cast into
the world to tread alone its dreary path. To Uncle Nathan victory and
defeat were alike the
messengers<pb n="71"/>
of woe. Both were the death-knell of human beings; both carried weeping
and wailing to women and children.</p>
            <p>After the last box of the pile had been conveyed on board, and
preparations were making to
cast off, the reflections of hero and moralist were disturbed by
several long, loud vociferations, in
a strong Hibernian accent. They proceeded from a man, dressed in the
tattered remnants of the
blue army uniform, who was industriously propelling a wheel-barrow
towards the landing, on
which was a box of similar description to those just embarked.</p>
            <p>"Hould on!" shouted he; "hould on, will yous, and take on this bit
of a box?"</p>
            <p>"Does it belong with the others?" asked the captain.</p>
            <p>"To be sure it does," replied Pat. "What the divil else does it
belong to? Arn't it the body of
Captain Farrell, long life to his honor! going home to see his frinds?"</p>
            <p>"Take it aboard," said Captain Drawler to the deck hands, after
examining the direction.</p>
            <p>The men lifted the box rather rudely, in a manner which seemed to
hurt poor Pat's feelings.</p>
            <p>"Bad luck to yous! where were you born, to handle the body of a
dead man the like o' that?"
said he. "Have yous no rispict for the mim'ry of a haro, that yous
trate his ramains so
ongintlemanly? Hould up your ind, darlint, and walk aisy wid it!"</p>
            <p>"Lively there," cried Captain Drawler, "lively, men!"</p>
            <p>"Bad luck to your soul for a blackguard, as ye are!" shouted Pat.
"Where did you lave your
pathriotism?"</p>
            <p>The box was by this time on deck, and the captain, to do him
justice, made all haste to
proceed on his voyage.</p>
            <p>The cases containing the remains of the officers were deposited in
the after part of the hold,
to which access was had by means of a hatch near the stern. Pat's
peculiar charge was placed on
top of the others, and he maintained a most vigilant watch over it.</p>
            <p>There was now a fair prospect of commencing the voyage,<pb n="72"/>
and our two passengers
were in high spirits. Henry was not a little fearful that the boat
would resume her long-occupied
position at the levee; the very thought of such a calamity was
painful in the extreme. But this fear
was not realized; the Chalmetta gave the levee a wide berth. The
Rubicon was passed; the shades
of doubt and anxiety were supplanted by the clear sunshine of a
bright prospect.</p>
            <p>"We are at last fairly started," said Henry, seating himself by
the side of Uncle Nathan, on
the boiler deck.</p>
            <p>"Thank fortin, we are!" responded the farmer, heartily. "We are
fast getting away from that
den of sin."</p>
            <p>"And you may preserve your morals yet," said Henry, with a
pleasant laugh.</p>
            <p>"My morals are safe enough, thank the Lord!" answered Uncle
Nathan, a little touched at this
reflection upon his firmness; "but I don't like the place, to say
nothing of its morals."</p>
            <p>"Very likely. But see that Irishman—the fellow who had
charge of the box. He looks
poorly enough, as far as this world's goods are concerned, but happy
and full of mirth, for all
that."</p>
            <p>"He looks as though he had seen hard times," added Uncle Nathan,
indifferently.</p>
            <p>"He does, indeed, like many other of the poor soldiers; but, I
warrant me, he has a stout will,
and an honest heart. I say, my fine fellow," said Henry, addressing
Pat, "come up here."</p>
            <p>"Troth I will, then, for I see yous wear the colors of Uncle Sam,"
replied the Irishman,
making his way to the boiler deck.</p>
            <p>"Long life to your honor!" continued Pat, as he reached the deck,
and making a low bow, as
he doffed his slouched hat,—"but I wish I had the money to
trate your honor."</p>
            <p>"Which means," replied Henry, "as you have not, I should treat you?"</p>
            <pb n="73"/>
            <p>"That's jist it, your honor. I persave your honor is college-larnt
by the way yous see
into my heart."</p>
            <p>Henry laughed heartily, and so did Uncle Nathan; though, to tell
the truth, our moralist of the
North was sorry to see his companion hand the man a "bit" to drink
with, for he was a member of
the temperance society.</p>
            <p>Pat got the "smile," and with a grateful heart returned to his patron.</p>
            <p>"Thank your honor, kindly," said Pat.</p>
            <p>"Now tell me, Pat, what regiment you served in," said Henry.</p>
            <p>"In the first Pennsylvanians,—Captain Farrell's company."</p>
            <p>"Captain Farrell's! I knew him well,—fine fellow and a
gallant officer! Many were the
tears shed when the vomito carried him off," said Henry, with much
feeling. "And you were one
of his company?"</p>
            <p>"Troth, I was, thin. He was ever inch a sodger and a gintleman."</p>
            <p>"And the box you brought on board contains his remains?"</p>
            <p>"Upon me sowl it contains the body of as good a man as iver
breathed the breath o' life,"
replied Pat, very emphatically.</p>
            <p>"Very true. You speak well of your captain, and he deserved all he
will ever get of praise.
Here, Pat, is a dollar for you; and if you want anything, come to me."</p>
            <p>"Thank your honor," replied Pat; uncovering, with a bow and a
scrape of the foot. "You are
as near like poor Captain Farrell as one pay is like another. Long
life to your honor,—may
you live forever, and then die like a haro!"</p>
            <p>"A genuine Irishman!" said Henry, as Pat descended to the main
deck; "one in whom
gratitude and faithfulness are as strong as life itself!"</p>
            <p>"He seems a good sort of man," returned Uncle Nathan, who had but
little appreciation of the
Irish heart.</p>
            <p>The conversation was interrupted by the ringing of the<pb n="74"/>
supper-bell. An eager
multitude rushed to the cabin; but every seat was already occupied.
On a crowded boat on the
Mississippi there is often much selfishness displayed. On the
Chalmetta half an hour before
tea-time the most knowing of the passengers had stationed themselves
in a line around the table,
ready to charge upon the plates, like a file of soldiers, the moment
the bell rang. Those who did
not understand the necessity of this precaution, on entering the
cabin were much surprised to find
every place occupied, and were comforted with the assurance of a
second table.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan and Henry secured seats which had been reserved for
ladies who did not
appear to claim them. Opposite them were seated Emily and her uncle.
She was dressed in deep
mourning, and her countenance was saddened by the gloom of
affliction. Her eyes were reddened
by weeping, in which she had indulged freely in the quiet of her
state-room. By intense effort she
had subdued her violent agitation, and a sad calmness rested upon her
face, that belied her
feelings.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll, who had not before been aware of her presence, was,
as may be supposed,
astonished at this meeting. In her sable dress and melancholy aspect
he read the sad affliction
which had befallen her in the death of her father. Their eyes met,
and exchanged warmer
greetings than their words could have done. A sad smile—the smile of
pleasure—rested upon her beautiful features, as they
interchanged salutations. Her pale
cheek was slightly crimsoned with a tell-tale blush. Her fluttering
heart refused to retain its
secret.</p>
            <p>Henry expressed his grief at the melancholy event which had
shrouded her in the weeds of
mourning,—not in words alone, but his sorrow for the death of a
kind friend was more
eloquently told in his countenance.</p>
            <p>Jaspar was chagrined at this meeting, and his awkward attempts to
be civil to Henry were
entire failures. This was an event for which he was not
prepared,—the consequences of
which filled him with anxiety. He knew that in Henry<pb n="75"/>
his wronged niece would have a
zealous advocate;—not a superannuated priest, but a young man
whose blood was warm,
and whose soul was full of energy. True, he reasoned, the young
officer was powerless as a
diplomatist. He as yet knew nothing of the will, or of Emily's
degraded position. Henry knew the
feelings and character of his brother, and would be the last one to
believe the infamous statement
of the will. What the father might have said to him in regard to her
he knew not. As guilt always
does, he imagined a thousand dangers, and saw with a clear vision the
real ones besides.</p>
            <p>At the tea-table there was little conversation beside the ordinary
courtesies of the occasion.
Jaspar said but little.</p>
            <p>The guilty never feel any security in the enjoyment of ill-gotten
wealth. The murderer is
haunted by the ghost or his victim. The cries of the widow and the
orphan continually ring in the
ear of the avaricious. The fear of discovery haunted Jaspar. Although
he saw no probability of his
villany being exposed, the fear of discovery troubled him day and
night. Revengeful and cruel,
dauntless and bold, as he had ever been, the present seemed a crisis
in his life. He had
accomplished the climax of villany, and as he had racked his powers
of invention for the means
of attaining his purpose, he now taxed them for the means of
concealing it. The insecurity of his
position was so tedious, that he sought, as the tempest-tost mariner
seeks the quiet haven, to
fortify it, so that he might be at rest from the tormenting doubts
which assailed him. Vain hope!
there is no rest for the wicked. Plots and schemes ran through his
mind; but they afforded no
satisfaction. There was only one event which promised the least
mitigation of his mental
sufferings, and this was the death of his niece. Black as he was at
heart, he shrank from her
murder,—not at the deed, but at the terrible consequences to
him which might follow it.</p>
            <p>Emily was conducted to the ladies' cabin by Jaspar, who, by a
dogged adherence to her side,
seemed determined to<pb n="76"/>
prevent any further conversation between her and Henry. But
the black chambermaid, with an official dignity which is oftentimes
necessary in her position,
politely requested him to retire. Jaspar left, satisfied she would be
safe from intrusion for the
present.</p>
            <p>Jaspar's disposition to prevent further conversation between Emily
and Henry was not
unperceived by the latter. He was satisfied that her uncle's close
attendance at her side—so
foreign to his former manner—was not without its purpose. Love,
which he had in vain
attempted to stifle, pressed more vigorously at his heart. In her
recognition of him he had read
that the sentiment in her heart was not abated by his absence. Her
melancholy aspect had
awakened a new interest in him. Disappointed in obtaining the
interview he desired, he sought
the hurricane deck to think of her, and to cherish the warm feeling
in his heart. But what was his
surprise, on reaching it, to find Emily there, and alone!</p>
            <p>After the departure of Jaspar she had retired to the gallery which
surrounds the cabin, to
enjoy the freshness of the evening air. The gallery was somewhat
crowded, and, with a lady and
gentleman, she had ascended to the hurricane deck. Her companions,
more gay and happy than
she, soon left her to the gloom and comparative silence which usually
reigns on the upper deck.
There were no other passengers there, and, fearing not the darkness
or the loneliness, she was
there venting the sadness which pervaded her heart. She was about to
descend, when she
recognized Henry.</p>
            <p>Emily related to him the circumstances of her father's death, and
of the reading of the will.</p>
            <p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Henry, in astonishment.</p>
            <p>"It is strange; but I cannot see any reason to disbelieve it,
except that my father's character
assures me it is not so."</p>
            <p>"Which would be a very good reason for disbelieving it. And you
are now on your way to
Cincinnati?"</p>
            <p>"I am; and it is the most melancholy journey I ever <orig>at-</orig>
               <pb n="77"/>
tempted. But I ought to be thankful for all that comes,—if I am
a slave, for the
freedom that awaits me."</p>
            <p>"Good Heavens! Emily, do not talk so! You freeze the blood in my veins!"</p>
            <p>"Nay, I feel somewhat reconciled to the terrible reality now, for
it little matters what I really
am, since the will—true or false—condemns me to the odium
of having been a
slave. You will not wish now to own your sister!" said Emily, with a
sad smile.</p>
            <p>"Yes, were you ten times a slave, it would not obliterate the mark
of the omniscient God! It
could not alter the beauty of the features or the character. I
should be proud of such a sister, even
did she wear the shackles. But you! No, no, there is no stain upon
your birth!"</p>
            <p>"And can you regard me as you once did? A—"</p>
            <p>"An angel. Yes, truly, as an angel of the higher order."</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay, this sounds not like the Henry Carroll of a month
since. You are a flatterer," said
Emily, with a smile.</p>
            <p>"I did but say what I would have gladly said then," replied Henry.</p>
            <p>The fear of ingratitude to a father no longer chained his heart to
the narrow limit of
friendship. He saw her before him trodden down by misfortune, in the
power of subtlety and
villany, and as a child of misfortune his heart even more strongly
inclined to her. He loved her
more tenderly than before.</p>
            <p>"Then, when sorrow was a stranger, you were subdued and distant to
your sister," said
Emily, her heart fluttering with the storm of emotion within it.</p>
            <p>"I am as I was then; but you were a child of affluence, and I
feared to—to—"</p>
            <p>"Why did you fear?" asked Emily, not waiting to hear the word
Henry was stammering to
enunciate. "Had you no confidence in your sister?"</p>
            <p>"I did have confidence in the <emph>sister</emph>. But I fear it
was not a sister's
confidence I sought."</p>
            <pb n="78"/>
            <p>"Indeed!" said Emily, her emotions destroying the appearance of
surprise the word
was intended to convey.</p>
            <p>"Emily, I will not now attempt to conceal the feelings which have
torn my heart," said
Henry, in a low tone, as he took her willing hand. "When I bade you
farewell,—alas! what
misfortunes have come since!—when I left you for I dared not
think how long, you know
not what violence I did to the warmest feeling of my heart. You know
not what misery the
struggle between that feeling and duty has caused me. I have striven
to conquer it; but Heaven
has now put you in my path, thus bidding me resist no more the
impulse of my heart. I love you,
Emily, and I have tried, for your sake and your father's, to conquer
my love. Say, Emily, may I
venture to hope my love is not unvalued?"</p>
            <p>A slight pressure of the hand he held was all the answer he
received—was, indeed, all
he asked.</p>
            <p>"You forget what I am," murmured Emily.</p>
            <p>"I will always forget what this will has said you are. But Heaven
will not let the innocent be
wronged, nor the guilty remain unpunished. A month since, how I
wished you were not the
heiress of a millionaire!"</p>
            <p>"Why did you wish it? Did you think that gold would blacken my heart?"</p>
            <p>"No, dear Emily, but it would have been ingratitude in me to win
your love, and thus destroy
any other plan your father might have cherished."</p>
            <p>"My father never had an avaricious disposition," replied Emily, warmly.</p>
            <p>"Far from it; but he might have had some views, in regard to his
daughter, with which I
might have interfered."</p>
            <p>"But you were a rebel against his views, notwithstanding," said
Emily, with a smile, and a
deep blush, which the darkness concealed from Henry.</p>
            <p>"I should have been sorry to have heard you say so, then; but now,
Heaven bless you for the
words!" replied Henry, with a warm pressure of the hand.</p>

            <p>"Madam," said Jaspar, who had stealthily approached, without the
knowledge of
the lovers, "to your state-room! Captain Carroll, as the guardian of
this lady, I request your entire
withdrawal, in future, from her society."</p>
            <p>"A request," replied Henry, proudly, "which I shall entirely disregard."</p>
            <p>"Then, by —— you will receive the penalty of your
obstinacy!" said Jaspar, in
a passion.</p>
            <p>"I am not to be intimidated by threats."</p>
            <p>"Do not provoke him, Henry!" said Emily, fearful for the safety of
him whom the last hour
had doubly endeared to her.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Dumont, <emph>her</emph> request I will obey," and Carroll
walked forward.</p>
            <p>He paused by the side of the wheel-house, to hear the report of
the leadsman, who was
sounding the depth of water, in obedience to the command of the
pilot, expressed in a single
clang of the heavy bell. Mechanically he had stopped, and with no
interest in the matter he
listened to the monotonous reply, "Quarter less three," &amp;c. He
was about to descend to the boiler
deck, when a shrill shriek startled him from his revery. There was no
mistaking the sound of that
voice! Without an instant's hesitation, he called to the pilot to
stop the boat, and, with a few
bounds, was by the side of Jaspar, who was calling lustily for help.
Henry, careless of his own
safety, slid down to the gallery abaft the ladies' cabin, and then
sprang to the single pole upon
which was suspended the small boat. Before he could unloose the
tackle, and lower himself
down, he heard a splash, and saw a man swimming towards the spot
where Emily had
disappeared. Henry plied a single oar in the stern of the boat, and
reached the place in season to
take in the noble fellow who had preceded him, together with his
lifeless burden, as he rose. The
steamer backed down, and in a few moments more the party was safely
on board again.</p>
            <pb n="80"/>
            <p>"Where is the man who saved her?" said the disappointed Jaspar,
after assisting
Emily to her state-room.</p>
            <p>Emily's fall had not been accidental, as the reader will at once
infer. Jaspar's passion, and the
danger which he thought the young officer's presence menaced, had
prompted him to an act
which was not attended with his usual prudence, and the failure was
likely to place him in a more
uncomfortable position than his former one. With the instinct of
deception, he immediately
offered a liberal reward to the man who had rescued her.</p>
            <p>"Where is he? Who is he?" shouted Jaspar, eagerly.</p>
            <p>"<emph>Here!</emph>" cried a voice from the crowd.</p>
            <p>Jaspar started and turned pale, for the voice was a familiar one.</p>
            <p>"Where is he?" called Jaspar again, concluding that he must have
mistaken the voice.</p>
            <p>"Here!" again came forth from the crowd, and Hatchie stepped forward.</p>
            <p>"Hell!" exclaimed Jaspar, staggering back as he recognized the man
whom he supposed his
rifle-ball had sent to furnish food for the fishes. But he recovered
his courage instantly, feeling
the danger of betraying himself.</p>
            <p>"Here is the reward," stammered he, holding out the money.</p>
            <p>"Never!" said Hatchie; and, before the crowd could clearly
understand the nature of the case,
he had vanished behind a heap of freight.</p>
            <p>At Jaspar's suggestion, a diligent search was made in every part
of the boat, but the mulatto
was nowhere to be found. Jaspar, as usual, invented a story to
account for the strangeness of the
incident which had occurred. A liberal reward offered by him failed
to produce the preserver of
Emily.</p>

            <p>ALTHOUGH the general condition of the
negro slaves at the South is the most degraded in which humanity can
exist, there are some
exceptions to the rule; and among them may well be placed the
body-servant of Colonel Dumont,
Hatchie, whose sudden and mysterious reappearance upon the deck of
the Chalmetta must be
accounted for.</p>
            <p>With an intelligence far superior to his condition, Hatchie
discovered the villany that lurked
in the eye of Jaspar, on the night of the forgery of the will. As we
have before said, no one better
than he knew the character of Jaspar; no one better than he knew of
what villany he was capable.
When he had been sent for the keys, an undefined sense of duty
prompted him to watch, and, if
possible, to prevent the mischief which he foresaw was gathering.
When ordered to retire, he had
pretended to obey; but he placed himself beneath the window through
which De Guy had
entered, a small crack of which had been accidentally left open. In
this position he saw Jaspar
take out the packet which he knew contained the will. He heard De Guy
read the fictitious will,
and at once discerned enough of the plot to comprehend the danger
that hovered over his
mistress. He understood that the real will was to be destroyed; and his<pb n="82"/>
first impulse
was to save it, which he had adroitly accomplished as before related.</p>
            <p>When Hatchie reached the open air, he was sensible of the
dangerous position in which his
bold act had placed him. So sudden and unpremeditated had been his
action that no thought of
future consequences had accompanied it. But, undismayed, he ran at
his fleetest speed towards
the river. He heard the footsteps of his pursuers, and every step he
advanced he expected to
receive the bullet of Jaspar. Trusting for safety to the darkness of
the night, he quickened his
speed, till he gained the steep bank of the river. Leaping into the
canoe which he discovered in
his flight, he pushed out into the stream, and was several rods
advanced towards the opposite
shore when his pursuers reached the bank.</p>
            <p>Plying the canoe with all the strength and skill of which he was
master, his progress was
suddenly interrupted by a log, upon which his frail bark struck with
much violence. The collision
checked his progress, and swung the canoe round by the side of the
log. Satisfied that Jaspar
would fire as soon as he saw the canoe, his ready ingenuity supplied
him with the means of
avoiding the ball, and of escaping further pursuit. Taking the will
in his mouth, he grasped the
canoe with one hand, and paddled silently with the other and with his
feet. He had turned the
canoe adrift, and Jaspar, without waiting to examine it, had fired.
Hatchie then jumped up in the
water, and produced the splash which had deceived his pursuers.</p>
            <p>With much difficulty the mulatto had propelled the log beyond the
reach of the current into
comparatively still water. Here he remained quietly on the log, using
only sufficient exertion to
avoid the current, until he was satisfied that Jaspar and his
companion had departed from the
bank. He then returned to the shore, using the greatest precaution to
avoid his enemies; but all
was still.</p>
            <p>Immediate danger being at an end, he bethought him of securing his
future safety,—a
matter of extreme difficulty<pb n="83"/>
for one in his position. He was satisfied that Jaspar would
invent some story to account for his disappearance; and just as well
satisfied that he would shoot
him, if he again showed himself on the plantation. He congratulated
himself on the happy
scheme he had adopted to deceive Jaspar; for he had now a reasonable
security from being
advertised and pursued as a runaway slave.</p>
            <p>After much reflection, he concluded his wisest plan would be to
seek safety in New Orleans,
where, in the crowd, he might escape recognition. The cane-brake and
the cotton-grove would
not protect him. He might be seen, and the blood-hound and the rifle
bring him in a prisoner, and
even Miss Emily would now be unable to save him from the penalty. How
could he live in New
Orleans, or how escape from there? He was without money, and he had
sense enough to know
that money is a desideratum, especially to the traveller.</p>
            <p>Of this useful commodity, however, he had a supply in the mansion
house, which he had
saved from the presents made him by Colonel Dumont and his guests.
Recognizing the necessity
of obtaining it, as well as some more clothing, he resolved to enter
the house and procure them,
after the light he saw in the library-window was removed.</p>
            <p>While waiting, he pondered more fully his position. What should be
his future conduct in
regard to the will? He carried with him, he felt, the future destiny
of his gentle, much-loved
mistress. He felt that on his action during the next hour depended
the happiness for a lifetime of
one whom he had been taught to revere, and whose gentleness and
beauty had almost lured him
to worship. If the morrow's sun found him in the vicinity of the
estate, he would probably fall a
victim to Jaspar's policy. What should he do with the will? Should
he show himself at the hour
appointed for the reading of it? He might fall into Jaspar's hands
in the attempt, the precious
document be wrested from him, and thus all his exertions be in vain.
Without the will itself he
could do nothing,—his word or his evidence in court would be of no<pb n="84"/>
avail. No
one would believe the former against Jaspar, and the latter was
inadmissible.</p>
            <p>Should he carry it to Mr. Faxon, or even to Miss Emily herself,
Jaspar might obtain
possession of it by some means.</p>
            <p>His deliberations could suggest no method by which immediate
justice could be done his
mistress; and the conclusion of his reflections was, that he must
place himself in a safe position
before he attempted to expose the villany of others. His mistress, he
knew by the will which he
had heard De Guy read, was to be conveyed to Cincinnati. He must go
to Cincinnati—but
how? This was a hard question for the faithful Hatchie to answer; but
answer it he must. He
would go to New Orleans, and there form his plan.</p>
            <p>After waiting till the lights were extinguished in the library, he
entered the house, and
obtained his money and clothing.</p>
            <p>By the exercise of much caution, he reached New Orleans in safety,
where, by the
disbursement of a small sum of money, he obtained a secure retreat in
the house of a free man,
with whom he had formerly been acquainted. His object was now to
obtain a passage to
Cincinnati,—a matter not easy to accomplish, as the law against
conveying blacks,
unprovided with the necessary permit, was very stringent. He could
not hope, with his limited
means, to offer an acceptable bribe for this service. To attain his
object, therefore, he must resort
to stratagem, for the chances of obtaining a passage by direct means
were too remote and too
perilous to be hoped for. But accident soon afforded him the means of
attaining his end.</p>
            <p>The negro with whom he had obtained a shelter kept a small shop,
and by the grace of the
authorities and his neighbors was permitted to sell liquor, tobacco
and cigars, to the steamboat
cooks, stewards, sailors, and the soldiers who thronged the city on
their return from Mexico. In
the rear of this shop, and connected with it, was a small room in<pb n="85"/>
which the negro lived.
This room afforded a safe retreat, and in it Hatchie had his hiding-place.</p>
            <p>One day a little knot of men, in the faded, dilapidated garments
of the army, entered the
tap-room of Hatchie's protector. They drank deeply, and, as was their
constant practice, they
seated themselves at the broken table, and commenced gambling with
the negro's dirty cards for
the few dollars which remained in their possession. This amusement
terminated, as such
amusements frequently do, in a fight, in which one of the number
seemed to be singled out as an
object of vengeance for the others. This individual was an Irishman;
and, for a time, he held way
manfully against his assailants. But, at last, in spite of the
exertions of the "proprietor" to protect
him, he was likely to get the worst of it, when Hatchie, no longer
able to control his indignation
at the unfairness displayed in the encounter, suddenly interfered in
favor of the now fallen man.
His enormous strength and skill soon cleared the room of the rioters.
Hatchie drew the defeated
Irishman into his hiding-place, and locked the door. This man was Pat
Fegan, who has been
introduced to the reader.</p>
            <p>Pat was filled with gratitude to his protector, and swore he would
stick by him till his dying
day, if he was a "naiger." A mutual friendship was thus established,
which resulted in the
disclosure of their future prospects. The fact that both were seeking
the same destination seemed
to strengthen the bond thus formed. Hatchie, shrewd by nature, read
the true heart of the
Irishman. He felt that he could trust him with his life; but his
ability was quite another thing.</p>
            <p>Pat Fegan was without means, and readily accepted the hospitality
which Hatchie offered to
pay for. In the course of the long conversations with which the two
friends beguiled the weary
day, Pat related his adventures in Mexico, at the close of which he
casually mentioned that the
remains of several officers, who died there, were to be conveyed up the<pb n="86"/>
river.
Hatchie's curiosity prompted many inquiries, which drew from the
talkative Hibernian a full
description of the boxes that contained the coffins, and many
particulars relative to the
transportation of them.</p>
            <p>Pat's description of the boxes suggested to Hatchie the means of
getting to Cincinnati.</p>
            <p>"Could you get me a box like those which contain these coffins?"
asked he.</p>
            <p>"Faix, I can, thin, if I only had the matther of two or three
dollars. But what the divil makes
yous ax sich a question?"</p>
            <p>"I will give you ten dollars, and pay your passage to Cincinnati
besides, if you will get me
the box," said Hatchie, disregarding Pat's query.</p>
            <p>"By me sowl, I'll get yous the box, and ax yous only the price
meself pays for 't," replied Pat,
touched at the idea of a reward, which between friends seemed base
even to his rude mind.</p>
            <p>"And I shall want your help, too."</p>
            <p>"Yous may well count on that, for whin did a Fegan desart his
frind? But tell me, honey,
what yous mane to do wid it."</p>
            <p>"I intend to get to Cincinnati in it."</p>
            <p>"Is it in the box?" exclaimed Pat, astonished beyond measure.
"Sure you will smodther!"</p>
            <p>"But, my friend, I want you to look out for that, and give me
something to eat and drink. You
can pretend that the box contains the body of your captain, who, you
said, died in Mexico."</p>
            <p>"Arrah, me darlint, I see it all!" and Pat shook his sides with
laughter at the idea of the
mulatto's "travelling-carriage," as he styled it.</p>
            <p>Pat had procured the box, and conveyed it to Hatchie's asylum. It
was sufficiently large to
furnish quite a roomy apartment. The covering consisted of short
boards, matched, and screwed
on crossways. To facilitate the introduction of<pb n="87"/>
food and air, and to afford the means of
a speedy exit in case of need, he had taken off half these boards,
and fastened them together with
cleats on the inner side. The ends of the screws were then filed off,
so that this portion of the lid
exactly corresponded with the other portion. A number of hooks were
then procured, so as to
fasten it upon the inner side. By this arrangement, the occupant of
the box would not be
dependent upon exterior aid for egress. When once on board the
steamer, he expected he should
be able to leave his hiding-place in the night, and perhaps at other times.</p>
            <p>Upon the outside the box was similar to the others, and was duly
marked and consigned.</p>
            <p>Hatchie's quarters were near the dépôt from which the
coffins were to be shipped, and Pat,
watching his time, had wheeled his own charge down in season to be
shipped with the others. In
the haste of embarking, the clerk had not noticed that one box more
had been brought on board
than his manifest indicated.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was not aware that Emily and her uncle were passengers on
the same boat till the
moment of the accident. He had before released himself from his
prison-box, and was enjoying
the fresh air, which the closeness of his box rendered particularly
desirable, when he heard the
scream of his mistress. Her voice was familiar, and even in the
scream of terror he recognized it.
It needed not a second thought to convince him of his duty. He had
saved her life, and, forgetful
of the danger of thus exposing his person, he stood by and saw her
conveyed to her state-room.
He heard Jaspar call for her deliverer, and offer a reward. This he
knew, if no one else did, was
gross hypocrisy, and in the indignation of his honest heart he had
stepped forward to confront
him. The sight of Jaspar, and the thought of his own responsibility,
recalled his prudence; and he
hastened to retrieve his error by escaping to his hiding-place in the
box, in which no one thought
of searching for a living man.</p>
            <p>In the excitement and exertion attendant upon the incident,<pb n="88"/>
Henry Carroll had not
recognized Hatchie; and, while Jaspar inquired for her deliverer, he
had been seeking the
surgeon. Henry thought of nothing but her safety.</p>
            <p>Hatchie at once knew the voice of Henry, but, knowing nothing of
the relation between him
and his mistress, he feared to trust him with his secret.</p>

            <p>EMILY DUMONT, while yet insensible, was
conveyed to her state-room, where, by the assiduous attention of the
stewardess and the lady
passengers, she was soon restored to consciousness. An army surgeon,
who was fortunately on
board, prescribed a course of treatment which prevented all evil
consequences, so that on the
following morning she appeared at breakfast as well as usual bodily,
though the terrible fact that
her uncle had attempted her life so agitated her that sleep had been
a stranger to her eyelids. By
whom she had been rescued was yet unknown to her.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll again took his place opposite her at the morning
meal,—a place he had
secured by the exercise of a full hour's patience in occupying it. At
the first convenient
opportunity, he congratulated her upon her safe recovery, and for the
first time she heard the
particulars of her rescue. Jaspar, with an ill grace, expressed his
obligations to him, though at the
same time he wished him at the bottom of the river.</p>
            <p>Henry failed not to notice the blush which came to her cheek, as
she modestly but fervently
expressed her gratitude for the noble service he had rendered her.
Although her accepted lover,
there had been but little intercourse of a <orig>ten-</orig>
               <pb n="90"/>
der nature
between them,—not enough to prevent her heart from fluttering
when he spoke, and
sending its warm blood to her cheek.</p>
            <p>With what indescribable pleasure does the lover recognize the
blush which a word or an act
of his own calls to the face of his new-found love! Like the breaking
clouds which disclose to the
worn mariner the faint outline of the distant land, he hails it as
the omen of future bliss! It is part
of the mystical language of the heart. It is part of the mechanism of
the affections, which the will
cannot conceal. The gentle look, the warm pressure of the hand, the
eloquent language of love,
which modesty at first forbids, are supplied by the timid, uncalled,
beautiful blush! Prudence and
delicacy cannot chain it in the veins.</p>
            <p>Henry read in her blush the warm current of pure love which flowed
from her heart. It told
him how willingly her gratitude coalesced with her love. Their
position at table did not afford the
opportunity of interchanging those feelings of the heart which each
felt swelling within. The
present, so full of joy and hope, it seemed cruel to surround with
circumstances which forbade
them to enjoy it. A crowded steamer is the most uncomfortable place
in the world for a pair of
lovers, and Henry and Emily felt the inconvenience of it.</p>
            <p>But, if the position of the lovers was uncomfortable, Jaspar's was
painful. They had the
consolation of loving and being loved; but he was now writhing under
the weight of an
additional torture. The appearance of Hatchie was the knell of all
his hopes, the precursor of ruin.
To him it was a mystery, and all his endeavors to solve it were unavailing.</p>
            <p>About noon the Chalmetta arrived at Baton Rouge, where, according
to previous
arrangement, and much to the joy of the perplexed uncle, De Guy came
on board. Jaspar greeted
him with more than usual courtesy, and felt, to as great a degree as
guilt can feel it, a relief from
the embarrassments which surrounded him. The first step of the
red-faced attorney, on finding no
state-room unoccupied, was to <orig>dis-</orig>
               <pb n="91"/>
possess two
flat-boatmen of theirs, by the payment of a round bonus. Jaspar
thought this a rather extravagant
move for one apparently so parsimonious; but his mind was too deeply
engrossed with the
difficulties which environed him to comment on extraneous subjects.</p>
            <p>To this state-room Jaspar and his confidant retired, to consider
the condition of their
operations; and while they deliberate we will return to another character.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan was in the full enjoyment of all the satisfaction
which seeing the world affords
to the observing man. He gazed with unceasing wonder upon the Father
of Waters, on whose
mighty bosom he was borne towards the loved scenes of home. He was
edified and amused with
the ever-varying succession of objects which presented themselves, as
the Chalmetta progressed.
Flat-boats and steamers, plantations and cotton-wood groves, islands
and cut-offs, were all
objects of interest. And, when he was tired of these, "Bunyan's
Pilgrim's Progress," which was
his constant travelling companion, afforded him all the excitement
his contented disposition
required. The time promised to be easily disposed of, even if the
passage should be unusually
prolonged. Besides, the number and variety of dispositions on board
afforded him some study,
and some instruction. There were men of all grades of society, and
all degrees of moral
worth,—beginning, of course, at a very moderate standard, and
descending to the vilest of
the vile, which last were in a large majority. There were tipplers,
and gamblers, and profane
swearers, in abundance; and Uncle Nathan felt, at the bottom of his
philanthropic heart, a desire
to lead them from their sins. Not that he was officious and
meddlesome, for he believed in "a
time for everything." In his modest, inoffensive way, no doubt, he
sowed the seeds of future
reformation in some wayward heart.</p>
            <p>Pat Fegan proved an apt disciple, and already had Uncle Nathan
given him the first lesson in
the form of a temperance lecture, which probably had its effect, as he left the<pb n="92"/>
boiler
deck without the dram for which he was supposed to have come up.</p>
            <p>"Now, Partrick," said Uncle Nathan, on the evening after Emily's
rescue, "rum never did any
one any good."</p>
            <p>"'Pon my soul it did, thin,—it makes me happy whin sorra
thing else in the wide world
will comfort me," replied Pat.</p>
            <p>"But that an't nateral happiness; it an't the sort that comes of
doin' good to your
feller-creturs."</p>
            <p>"It sinds throuble away—what else is happiness?"</p>
            <p>"But how do you feel arterwards? That's the pint."</p>
            <p>"Arrah! bad enough, sure. Yous have the betther of me there."</p>
            <p>"Then leave it off, Partrick," responded Uncle Nathan, drawing the
pledge from his pocket.
"Sign the pledge, and you are safe."</p>
            <p>But we need not follow Uncle Nathan in his reformatory
lucubrations. Pat signed the pledge;
but whether he had an appreciating sense of the restraint he imposed
upon his appetite we cannot
say. Uncle Nathan thought him saved from his cups, and rejoiced
accordingly. Perhaps, if he had
looked a little closer, he might have suspected an interested motive
on the part of Pat. He saw
none, and, feeling secure in the present victory, he admonished his
disciple "to stick to it as long
as he lived."</p>
            <p>"'Pon me word, I will, thin," replied Pat. "I see yous are a
gintleman, if yous don't look jist
like one. Now, do you see, Mr. Binson, you are jist the man I am
looking for, this last six hours."</p>
            <p>"Why so, Partrick—what do you mean?" said Uncle Nathan,
mystified by the sudden
change of manner in the new convert.</p>
            <p>"Hould aisy a bit, for I'd like to hould a private correspondence
wid yous. Will ye jist come
to the hurricane deck, till I tells yous all about it?"</p>
            <pb n="93"/>
            <p>"Sartain," replied Uncle Nathan, his curiosity fully excited.</p>
            <p>As soon as they reached a deserted portion of the promenade deck,
Pat, after satisfying
himself there were no listeners near, commenced, with an air of grave
importance, his story.</p>
            <p>"Whisht now, and draw near," said he. "Can yous keep a sacret?"</p>
            <p>"Well, I think I could, if it was an honest one."</p>
            <p>"Faix, thin, it <emph>is</emph> an honest one. Sure yous come
from the North, and don't
belave in keeping the naigers in bondage."</p>
            <p>"To be sure not."</p>
            <p>"Well, then, would yous help a naiger out of throuble, if yous
could as well as not?"</p>
            <p>"I sartainly wish 'em well; but the Scripture says 'Honor the
king,' which means nothin' more
nor less than 'obey the laws.' Arter all, though, perhaps we ought
not to mind wicked laws."</p>
            <p>"Musha bad luck to your raysoning! Sure I'm no docthor, to blarney
over the matther. Will
yous kape the sacret?" asked Pat, a little excited, and somewhat
disappointed to find his auditor
lukewarm in "the cause."</p>
            <p>"Sartain; tell your story, and, if I can't do you any good, I
won't do you any harm."</p>
            <p>"That's the mon for me!" replied Pat, slapping Uncle Nathan
familiarly on the back. "Now,
do you see, there's a naiger on this boat, that wants a frind."</p>
            <p>"A friend!" said Uncle Nathan, with some doubt, as he reflected on
the conflict between the
claims of humanity and the stringent laws of the slave states.</p>
            <p>"To be sure, a <emph>frind!</emph>" replied Pat, with emphasis.</p>
            <p>"I <emph>will</emph> befriend him," replied Uncle Nathan, his
natural inclination
triumphing over his fear of the law.</p>
            <p>"Spoken like a Christian! Sure, that's jist what St. Patrick would
say, if the saint—long
life to him!—were<pb n="94"/>
here," replied Pat, rejoicing that the difficulty was
overcome.</p>
            <p>"Now, dhraw near till I tells yous all about it; and, if iver you
mintion a word of it, may your
sowl never lave purgatory till it is burnt to a cindther! Now, do you
mind, there's a naiger
concayled in the hould of the boat, that wants to correspond with a
faymale in the cabin."</p>
            <p>"But he will expose himself, and she may deliver him up."</p>
            <p>"Divil a bit! Didn't he save her from dhrowning, last night?"
exclaimed Pat, warmly, for this
act of Hatchie excited all his admiration.</p>
            <p>"Good gracious! you don't say so!" and Uncle Nathan understood the
mystery of the previous
night.</p>
            <p>"Sorra a word o' lie in it."</p>
            <p>"But where in natur is the feller?" asked the wonder-struck
Yankee, his curiosity getting the
better of every other consideration.</p>
            <p>"Whisht, now," whispered Pat; "he is in one of those boxes, with
the dead men! Do yous
mind?"</p>
            <p>"Good gracious! how you talk! In a coffin?"</p>
            <p>"Divil a coffin at all. Sure as nate a bit of a box as iver held a
Christian."</p>
            <p>"But why does he wish to speak with the lady?"</p>
            <p>"Sorra know I know," replied Pat, to whom Hatchie had communicated
no more than was
necessary.</p>
            <p>"Does he wish to see her in person?"</p>
            <p>"Not a bit of it. Now, do you mind, I saw you speaking to the
lady, and I tould him of it.
Then the naiger axed me could he trust yous. I tould him yes; and he
tould me to bring yous
down to him, and that's the whole of it. Now, will yous go down the
night and spake to him?"</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan reflected a little; for, though no craven, he was
very prudent, and had no
romance in his composition. After deliberating some time, much to the
detriment of Pat's
patience, he replied in the affirmative.</p>
            <pb n="95"/>
            <p>Pat then instructed him in relation to certain precautions to be
observed in order to
avoid notice, and left him to ponder the strangeness of the
adventure. He had well considered his
course, and, having decided upon it, he was earnest in pursuing it.
He had chosen, he felt, a
dangerous, but his conscience assured him a right path, and nothing
could now deter him from
proceeding in it. He was not fickle, and invoked many a blessing on
the effort he might make for
the salvation of the poor negro. True, his prudence had magnified the
undertaking, which was a
trivial affair, into a great adventure. Imagination often makes bold men.</p>

            <p>JASPAR and De Guy were for a long time
closeted in the state-room. On their reappearance Jaspar felt much
easier. The silky-toned
attorney had used a variety of arguments to convince him that their
schemes were working
excellently well, and that everything, notwithstanding the
resurrection of the negro, would
terminate to his entire satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The process of "wooding-up" on a Mississippi steamer, inasmuch as
it affords the passengers
an opportunity to exercise their locomotive powers on shore, is
regarded as an interesting
incident. This was particularly true on board the Chalmetta, for she
was crowded to nearly
double her complement of cabin-passengers, and the space usually
devoted to exercise was too
much crowded to render it very pleasant.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, the Chalmetta touched at a wood-yard, after
leaving Baton Rouge, the
passengers hurried on shore, to enjoy the novelty of an unconfined
promenade. De Guy, on
pretence of further private conversation, induced Jaspar to forsake
his post as sentinel over
Emily, and join him in a walk. For half an hour the attorney in his
silky tones regaled the ears of
Jaspar with various strange schemes, until the bell of the steamer
announced her near departure.<pb n="97"/>
Even then De Guy seemed in no haste, and assured his companion the
boat would not
start without them. But the second bell admonished them that the
steamer was already getting
under way. The passengers were all on board, and, as they heard in
the distance the tinkling of
the engineer's bell, they started at a run to reach her. By some
accident, De Guy's foot got
between Jaspar's legs, and he fell. The attorney stooped, as if to
assist him up, but, in reality,
struck the fallen man a blow, which rendered him insensible. De Guy
hurried towards the boat,
leaving the watchful uncle to shift for himself. He reached the
landing in season to jump upon the
stem of the boat as it swung in shore. Pushing through the crowd
which had gathered to witness
his exploit of getting on board, he retreated to his state-room, and
locked the door.</p>
            <p>Jaspar was not immediately missed by Emily, and his absence was
too desirable to be the
cause of any solicitude. As the tea-hour approached, and the ladies
were requested to take their
places at table, she was very much surprised to see <emph>Mr.
Maxwell</emph> present himself
as her escort to the table. Since the unhappy disclosure of his love
in the office, she had regarded
him with pity, rather than with the contempt he merited. She could
not but feel that he loved her.
His eloquent language and forlorn aspect had not been in vain, for
they had saved him from her <emph>utter</emph> contempt. A true woman
cannot be conscious of possessing a portion of
the love, even of a dissolute man, without feeling some respect for
him. To love truly and
devotedly is an element of the angelic character; and such love will
purify and ennoble even the
grossest of human beings. Emily unconsciously arrived at this
conclusion; and, discerning some
indications of pure love towards her in his gross and earthly mind,
she felt that he was entitled to
her sympathy. She cherished no affection for him; all that her gentle
heart could contain was
bestowed upon another. A suspicion had more than once entered her
mind that Maxwell was, in
some manner, <orig>con-</orig>
               <pb n="98"/>
nected with the foul plot which had
drawn her into its toils. But, she reasoned, if he loved her, he
would not injure her,—no,
not even in revenge for her refusal. <emph>She</emph> could not, and
her beautiful nature
would not allow her to believe it, even of a man as gross as her
better judgment told her Maxwell
was.</p>
            <p>To her inquiry for her uncle, Maxwell informed her that he had
some conversation with him
since he came on board at Baton Rouge, and that he had requested him
to attend her at tea. He
had not seen him since, but supposed he was forward, or in his state-room.</p>
            <p>Emily readily accepted his arm, for anything was a relief from the
hateful presence of Jaspar.
Maxwell used all the art which politeness could lend to render
himself agreeable. His ready wit,
and the adaptation of his conversation to the unhappy circumstances
of her position, in some
measure dispelled the misery of the hour. Besides, it was plain the
attorney did not believe the
statement of the will; for a high-born Southern gentleman would never
associate in public with a
slave girl. She had, too, a presentiment that he came on some errand
to her. Perhaps the good
minister, Mr. Faxon, had sent him with good news to her. Perhaps
through him the will had been
proved false. Such reflections as these imparted more interest to his
society than she would
otherwise have felt.</p>
            <p>During the tea-hour his assiduous courtesy left scarcely a
particular in which Henry Carroll,
who, as before, occupied a seat opposite to him, could render himself
of use. He could hardly
address a word to her without interrupting her companion. An
introduction, which had before
placed the young captain and the attorney on speaking terms, did not
prevent the latter from
mixing excessively good with excessively bad breeding. He was
apparently unwilling that Henry
should be heard by Emily. Maxwell had some idea of the relation which
subsisted between his
two companions; but, of course, knew nothing of the previous night's
interview,<pb n="99"/>
which
had indissolubly bound their hearts together. He seemed determined to
keep their sympathies as
far apart as possible.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll wondered at the absence of Jaspar and at the sudden
appearance of Maxwell,
for he had not before seen him. His attentions to her he loved
created no jealousy. Emily had
satisfactorily acknowledged her affection for him, and to believe her
pure nature, especially
under the present circumstances, susceptible of coquetry, were
infidelity. A single look beaming
with love had assured him that his star was still in the ascendant.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion, Maxwell, with the same elegant courtesy,
conducted her back to the
ladies' cabin. Emily repeated her acknowledgments for the attentions,
and was about to enter her
state-room, when he addressed her.</p>
            <p>"May I beg the favor of a few moments' private conversation, Miss
Dumont?" said he, in a
more business-like manner than that he had assumed at the tea-table.</p>
            <p>Emily hesitated. Her supposition concerning his mission was partly
verified in this request;
but the remembrance of her last interview with him at his office in
New Orleans came like a
cloud over the bright sky of her hopes. Curiosity and a painful
interest prompted her to risk the
interview. If this interview was likely to be of an unpleasant
nature, she could retire; and, if the
worst she apprehended was likely to be realized, she knew that Henry
Carroll hovered near her,
at all times, like a guardian angel.</p>
            <p>"In your legal capacity, I presume?" said she, with a smile and a
crimson face.</p>
            <p>"Certainly, certainly," replied Maxwell, not a little disconcerted
to discover this troublesome
caution.</p>
            <p>"Will you take a seat, then? I think no one will feel an interest
in our conversation beside
ourselves."</p>
            <p>"Excuse me," replied Maxwell, in his blandest tones, "a few words
of our conversation
overheard might expose persons we wish not to injure."</p>
            <pb n="100"/>
            <p>"Perhaps it had better be deferred to a more convenient opportunity."</p>
            <p>"Delays are dangerous, Miss Dumont. Justice to yourself requires
that my communication be
made at once. Allow me to attend you to the promenade deck, where we
shall be secure from
interruption."</p>
            <p>Emily, with many doubts, accepted his arm, and they proceeded to
the promenade deck.</p>
            <p>"Now, Mr. Maxwell," said Emily, in a very serious tone, for she
wished to awe the profligate
into the most businesslike reserve, "be as speedy as possible, for I
am fearful of the effects of the
night-air upon my health."</p>
            <p>Maxwell was disconcerted at this change in the manner of his
companion, and vexed to
account for it. The remembrance of past events came to his aid, but
afforded no satisfactory
solution. He could not see why Emily should studiously reject his
overtures. His experience of
female society had been of the most flattering character. He was
perfectly aware of his
popularity. His personal attractions always had been a strong
recommendation, and he could not
see why they should not be in this instance. His family was good, his
fortune supposed to be
respectable,—everybody did not know the inroads he had made
upon it; his business was a
pastime—the gate of honor and fame. It was true his character
was dissolute, but she did
not know this.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for him and his prospects, she did know it, and the
fact had all the weight
which a virtuous mind attaches to such a circumstance.</p>
            <p>"I have been fortunate enough to obtain some information which may
be of great value to
you, or I should not thus have intruded upon you," said Maxwell, with
the air of a man upon
whom suspicion rested unjustly.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, Mr. Maxwell!" replied Emily, forgetting both the
night-air and the character of the
man who stood beside her; "pray, tell me all at once!"</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," replied he, coldly, "as the story is <orig>some-</orig>
               <pb n="101"/>
what lengthy, perhaps it might be deferred till to-morrow, if your
health is likely to suffer
from exposure at this hour."</p>
            <p>Emily was confused; but she could not stoop to the weakness of
deception to smooth over
her former coldness. She was burning with impatience to be restored,
even in imagination, to the
position from which she had been degraded by the cruel will. Her
companion's language was not
calculated to remove her doubts of his intentions. If the
communication was of a business
character, why should he be offended at her haste to terminate the
interview? This reflection
strengthened her resolution not to conciliate him. She would trust to
Providence and the justice
of her cause, rather than make an intimate of a man whom she despised.</p>
            <p>"Miss Dumont," said Maxwell, growing desperate at the lady's
silence, "perhaps I have
offended in some manner. If I have, it was unintentional, and I trust
you will forgive me."</p>
            <p>"O, no, sir, not at all!" exclaimed Emily, mollified, in spite of
herself, by the humility of the
attorney. "There is no offence, and no apology is necessary."</p>
            <p>"I am greatly relieved by this assurance, and, with your leave,
will proceed with my
narrative."</p>
            <p>Maxwell now entered into a relation of the history of the will,
but studiously avoided
imparting a single fact with which she was not already acquainted.
All this he had related with a
lawyer's skill, to awaken her curiosity and interest, and to remove
by distance any unpleasant
suspicions which might have been awakened in her mind in regard to
his motives.</p>
            <p>To all he said Emily listened with profound attention, momentarily
expecting the
development of the foul plot. But thus far Jaspar Dumont is as pure
as an angel,—nothing
is disclosed. In this manner half an hour passed away, and Emily was
no wiser than at first.</p>
            <p>Maxwell has now, with an adroitness peculiar to the successful
lawyer, made <emph>himself</emph> the subject of his remarks. He is<pb n="102"/>
careful that she shall know how sagacious
he has been in discovering the facts he has not yet revealed. He
tells her how many weary days
and nights he has spent in searching out the truth; what wonderful
intelligence of his had
converted the shadow of a suspicion into the reality of an
incontrovertible conviction; how a
single word he casually overheard has been followed through weary
days and dismal nights, till
he has arrived, with all the evidence in his hands, at the truth!</p>
            <p>Emily was certainly grateful for the deep interest he had
manifested in her behalf, and she
expressed her gratitude with modest earnestness.</p>
            <p>"But, Miss Dumont," continued Maxwell, "I could not thus have
sacrificed myself for every
client. My health and strength, under ordinary circumstances, would
have given way, and the
case have been lost."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, sir, you may rely on the fullest and most substantial
acknowledgment for the service
you have rendered. My purse shall be entirely at your disposal,"
responded Emily, warmly and
innocently.</p>
            <p>"Money, Miss Dumont, would not have tempted me to make the
sacrifice of health and
comfort which this exertion has required of me. I have done all my
humble talents would permit
from a higher motive. I look for my reward in the consciousness of
having done my duty."</p>
            <p>"I trust, Mr. Maxwell, you will receive the great reward which is
sure to follow every noble
and true action."</p>
            <p>Emily was sadly perplexed to understand this new and singular
phenomenon.</p>
            <p>"The act itself is its own reward," said Maxwell, with an attempt
to counterfeit humility,
which was very awkward, but which deceived Emily, agitated as she was
by hopes and fears.</p>
            <p>"But, as I said," continued he, "I would not have done this for
every client, and I trust you
will pardon me when<pb n="103"/>
I say the only reward I look forward to is your smile of
approval."</p>
            <p>"I certainly cannot but approve of the motives which have actuated
you, and your actions
perhaps I could better appreciate if my knowledge of them was more
extensive," responded
Emily, disappointed and displeased, as her suspicions were reawakened.</p>
            <p>But a faint smile rested upon her beautiful features, as if to
soften the reproof she had
administered, and to conceal her rising emotions. She felt that
Maxwell could assist her, but she
feared every moment that some allusion to the prohibited subject
would compel her to banish
him from her presence.</p>
            <p>"A smile from you were an ample reward for all my trouble and
exertion," said Maxwell,
deceived by the smile of Emily. "To be as sincere as your generous
nature demands, I cannot
conquer the love I have before expressed. I— "</p>
            <p>"Excuse me, sir," indignantly interrupted Emily, "I must retire."</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay, Miss Dumont! I meant no offence. Hear me but for a moment!"</p>
            <p>"Not another instant, sir! You have deceived me."</p>
            <p>"Upon my honor, I have not. I possess the evidence by which your
birthright and possessions
may be restored."</p>
            <p>"No more! I had rather die in poverty, with the stain clinging to
me, than owe the restoration
of my rights to you. You have taken advantage of my unprotected
condition to impose upon me."</p>
            <p>"You wrong me, Miss Dumont; as, if you will remain but a moment, I
will prove to you,"
said Maxwell, pleading like an injured man.</p>
            <p>Maxwell's peculiar tone and penitent air made Emily pause, and
perhaps think she had
spoken too hastily. All the wrong of which she could accuse him was,
that he loved her. She felt
that this was not a crime. The remembrance<pb n="104"/>
of wrongs she knew he had inflicted
upon others, perhaps weak and unprotected like herself, nerved her
resolution, and to a word of
love from him she could not listen. She wished to conciliate him, if
possible, but not at the
expense of her self-respect.</p>
            <p>"Why have you detained me all this time to listen to a story with
which I was before as
familiar as yourself? Why have you used the language of love, which a
refusal to hear now
renders insolent?"</p>
            <p>"I have offended you, Miss Dumont," said he, in the humblest
tones; "can I hope to be
forgiven?"</p>
            <p>"Your future conduct alone can secure my forgiveness."</p>
            <p>"Then I solemnly promise never again to allude to the admiration
with which I have regarded
your matchless beauty, or to mention the love which now consumes my heart."</p>
            <p>"I trust you are sincere," said Emily, not knowing whether to
smile or frown upon this
making and breaking the promise in the same breath. The deep anxiety
she felt for her future fate
made her disposed to forget the past, and in a gentler tone she
expressed her forgiveness.</p>
            <p>Maxwell imagined that, at last, his star was in the ascendant. His
experience of woman-kind
only indicated that he had been too precipitate, and that the
reserve, even the refusal he had
received, were only the accidents of the moment, not the natural
expression of an indifferent
heart. His assurance increased as he reflected. He was led to believe
that he might, now that the
ice-barrier was removed, be more unreserved in his wooing. His
perseverance had now overcome
all obstacles, and the prize was in his grasp.</p>
            <p>"I have a plan to propose," said he, "which will immediately
secure to you all your rights."</p>
            <p>"Pray what is it?" asked Emily, eagerly.</p>
            <p>"As you have forbidden me to speak of love, I am placed in a very
unfortunate position. In
short, you can obtain possession of your estate by returning as my wife."</p>
            <p>This last sentence was said in a whisper, and in a tone of<pb n="105"/>
assurance, as though he
felt she would gladly accept the alternative.</p>
            <p>"Sir!" exclaimed Emily, aghast with astonishment and indignation,
for the abruptness of the
degrading proposition nearly deprived her of the power of speech.</p>
            <p>"Even so, Emily. I have the power to restore your rights, and will
do so on this condition.
The ceremony may be performed at Natchez, where we shall arrive
to-night; or, if you fear I
promise more than I can perform, I will draw up an agreement, which
you shall sign, to the effect
that you will accept my hand on the restoration of your rights. I
will give you two hours to think
of it; and if, at the end of that time, you accept the proposal, I
will at once take the necessary
steps to regain your fortune, and remove the stigma which rests on
your name."</p>
            <p>"Never, sir, never! I will die a beggar before I will owe my
prosperity to such a contract!"
exclaimed Emily, whose indignation now found utterance.</p>
            <p>"I beg madam will reflect before she decides," said Maxwell, in a
satirical tone.</p>
            <p>"Sir, I will die upon the rack, before the hand of a villain shall
lead me to the altar!"
answered Emily, unable to control her feelings.</p>
            <p>"Softly, lady, softly!"</p>
            <p>"Leave me, sir! leave me, or I will call upon my uncle to protect
me from further insult!"</p>
            <p>"Your <emph>uncle</emph>, I fear, was left at the last wood-yard;
so I heard my friend De
Guy say."</p>
            <p>Emily felt herself the victim of a plot, and, rousing all her
energies, she said, "I see it all. The
machinations of a villain—for such you are—shall be foiled."</p>
            <p>"Miss Dumont," said Maxwell, his passions roused by the severity
of her epithet, "do you
forget your condition? You are a <emph>slave!</emph> Your supposed
uncle is not here. You<pb n="106"/>
have no free papers, and are liable to be committed to the next jail."</p>
            <p>"But I am not without a friend who is able to protect me," said
Emily, with spirit, as she saw
Henry Carroll ascend to the deck upon which they stood.</p>
            <p>"Your friend is helpless. Another word, and I will proclaim your
condition," and he rudely
seized her by the arm. "Your friend cannot help you. He has not your
free papers."</p>
            <p>"But he has a strong arm!" shouted Henry Carroll, as with a single
blow he struck the
attorney to the deck.</p>
            <p>"This way, Emily," said he to the weeping girl, who clung
tremblingly to him; "you are safe
now."</p>
            <p>Emily was conducted by the gallant arm which had protected her
from we know not what
indignity. She felt secure in his presence from further molestation,
and his soothing words and
hopeful promises did much to restore her.</p>
            <p>Maxwell soon recovered from the effects of the blow he had
received, and, boiling with
passion, swore vengeance upon the man who had interrupted him. But
his passion was of short
duration, and was succeeded by sober reflections upon the "position
of his case." Emily Dumont
was not of that class of women with whom he was accustomed to deal.
He had found in her an
element with which he had not before been conversant,—of which,
indeed, he had read in
books of poetry, but did not believe it existed in the material world.</p>

            <p>ON board the Chalmetta, Maxwell discovered an
old acquaintance in the person of a notorious gambler,—a class
of persons who congregate
on Mississippi steamers, and practise their arts upon the unwary
traveller. This person, who went
by the name of Vernon, was well known at the faro and roulette boards
in New Orleans. He was
an accomplished swindler. In the winter season, when the city is
crowded with the élite of the
state, and with strangers from all parts of the Union, Vernon found
abundant exercise for his
professional ability at the hells of the city, in the employment of
their proprietors, acting the part
of banker, or anything else that offered him the means of gratifying
his luxurious habits. A
twinge of conscience never prevented him from adopting any means of
emptying the pockets of
his victims, even without the formality of dice or cards.</p>
            <p>In the summer season he beguiled his time on the river, or
migrated with the fashionables to
Pascagoula, or a more northern watering-place,—in fine, to any
sphere which afforded
him a theatre for the exercise of his talents as a blackleg. Wherever
he was, he never passed by
an opportunity to obtain possession of his neighbor's valuables.<pb n="108"/>
If the monied man
would accept a hand at euchre or poker, why, he was so much the
easier cleaned out; if not, false
keys, pick-locks, or sleight-of-hand, soon relieved the unfortunate
victim of his superfluous
possessions.</p>
            <p>Early in his career of fashionable dissipation, Maxwell had made
the acquaintance of this
notorious individual. Indeed, he had sufficient cause to remember
him, for he had made a deep
inroad into his patrimony. Maxwell was too great a rascal himself to
be long duped by a greater
one. A kind of business intimacy had grown up between them, and
continued to exist at the time
of our story. This connection was not, however, publicly acknowledged
by Maxwell; it would
have been the ruin of his fine prospects but he used him whenever a
scheme of profit or revenge
required an unscrupulous confederate. Yet this Vernon was by no means
a dependent creature of
Maxwell's, for he was bold, reckless, and independent to the last
degree. Whether acting as the
paid devil of another, or on his own responsibility, he bowed to no
power but his own will. His
physical courage was well known to be of the most obstinate
character. When the coward dandy
had an enemy to punish, Vernon, for a hundred dollars, would first
insult and then fight the
luckless individual. This had formerly been a lucrative part of his
trade; but latterly his claims to
the distinction of <emph>gentleman</emph> and <emph>man of
honor</emph> had been of
such a questionable character, that the man who refused to meet him
did not lose caste among the
bloods of the city.</p>
            <p>Vernon was now on his way to a wider sphere of action than New
Orleans, with its yellow
fever season at hand, afforded him. As usual, he practised his arts
on board the Chalmetta, which,
however, afforded him but a narrow field, the passengers being mostly
officers, who had left
their pay in the cabarets of Mexico.</p>
            <p>By some means he had ascertained that Henry Carroll was in
possession of a considerable
sum of money. By all the arts in his power he had endeavored to lure him to the<pb n="109"/>
gambling-table, which was constantly spread in the cabin, and
surrounded by unfortunate
victims, vainly striving against the coolness and trickery of
professional blacklegs, to recruit their
exhausted finances, or retrieve the ruin to which an unlucky hour had
enticed them. Henry
obstinately refused to take a hand; but Vernon's heart was set upon
the bag of gold he knew was
in Henry's trunk, and he resolved to possess it,—a feat not
easy to accomplish on board a
crowded steamer.</p>
            <p>After Maxwell had recovered from the blow which had felled him to
the deck, and while
Henry was soothing the distress of Emily, he met Vernon, who was in
the act of reconnoitring
the young officer's state-room. Vernon was just the person to serve
him in this extremity. The
protector of Emily must be removed from his charge, as her uncle had
been by De Guy. He
resolved upon a consultation with the blackleg. Accordingly he
expressed his desire, to which the
gambler replied by requesting him to give notice of the approach of
any one, while he did a little
business in the state-room.</p>
            <p>Maxwell vainly remonstrated, but was obliged to comply with the
wishes of the robber, or
lose his services.</p>
            <p>Vernon, thus protected from intrusion, entered the room, and by
the aid of a pick-lock soon
succeeded in obtaining possession of all poor Henry's earthly wealth.
Beckoning Maxwell to
follow, he descended to the main deck, where, procuring a lantern,
they proceeded aft.</p>
            <p>We must return to Uncle Nathan and Pat Fegan, whom we left on
their way to the fugitive in
the hold of the steamer.</p>
            <p>"Whisht, now," said Pat, in a whisper, as they prepared to jump
down the hatchway; "whisht,
now, and don't spake a loud word, for the life of yous."</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan promised obedience, and followed Pat into the hold.
All was total darkness,
and it was not without a feeling of superstitious dread that Uncle
Nathan heard his<pb n="110"/>
companion tap on the box which contained the mulatto. He heard the
whispered recognition of its
inmate, and stood like a statue while Hatchie freed himself from his
confinement.</p>
            <p>"Whisht, now," said Pat, in a low voice; "give me your hand, Mr.
Binson. Now, there yous
are," and he placed Uncle Nathan's hand in that of Hatchie.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan found the hand was warm, and felt completely relieved
of the sensation of fear
which had come over him.</p>
            <p>"Glad to see you," said he, though an instant afterwards his
conscience asked him if he had
not told a lie, inasmuch as it was so dark he could not see anything.</p>
            <p>"You are a <emph>friend</emph>, I trust," replied Hatchie, who,
although he implicitly
relied on the <emph>faith</emph> of the Irish ally, had not the
fullest confidence in his
judgment. Nothing but what he deemed a stern necessity would have
compelled him to trust the
secret with any one. So many dangers encompassed him, that the duty
he owed to his injured
mistress obliged him to look around for the means of preserving the
valuable document he
possessed. An accident to the steamer, the continuous danger of being
restored to Jaspar, and a
hundred other painful reflections, brought him to the resolution of
depositing the will in the
hands of the most trustworthy person he could find. In this
extremity, he canvassed the characters
of all he knew on board. Henry Carroll, he feared, was too impetuous,
if not actually devoted to
Jaspar. He knew nothing of the interesting relation which the hearts
of the lovers had
recognized,—pity he did not! Uncle Nathan, whom Pat had
described in glowing
colors,—none are more highly esteemed than those who confer the
most solid
benefits,—seemed to him the proper person, especially as Pat
had seen <emph>her</emph> speak to him after the accident. An honest
man is so easily known, that the poor
Irishman's instinctive knowledge of human nature imparted the most
correct information.</p>
            <p>"I <emph>am</emph> your friend, and I trust the Lord will always put<pb n="111"/>
it into my
heart to befriend the unfortunate," said Uncle Nathan, in answer to
Hatchie's remark.</p>
            <p>"It is not on my own account that I need a friend," said Hatchie,
in a melancholy tone, for the
responsibility which rested upon him had solemnized his mind, and
banished all reflections of
self. "It matters little what becomes of <emph>me</emph>. But, sir,
you are a stranger to me,
and I know not that I may trust you."</p>
            <p>"Nor I nuther, till I know what you want of me. If it is an honest
sarvice, one that I can do
without goin' agin my conscience, why, I am ready to do anything to
help a feller-cretur."</p>
            <p>"The service I am about to request," replied Hatchie, his doubts
in a great measure removed
by the apparent sincerity of his auditor, "can be done honestly; and,
if your conscience approves
any act, it will approve this one."</p>
            <p>"Very well, I will act for you to the best of my judgment, and use
all the discretion that natur
gave me, and a little I learned by the way-side. Partrick tells me
you want to talk with the lady
whose life you saved last night."</p>
            <p>"Not exactly to talk <emph>with</emph> her, but about her. I feel
that I can trust you, even
with her destiny. That lady is my mistress. She is an angel of
goodness. I am perfectly willing to
be <emph>her</emph> slave, so that it was not to gain my freedom I
escaped in this box. It was
to save her from a cruel wrong which her uncle would inflict upon her."</p>
            <p>"That old gentleman who is with her?" interrupted Uncle Nathan.</p>
            <p>"The same. He is the most hardened villain in the world,—so
different from my poor
master, who was a good man, and loved even his slaves! This man would
make it appear that my
mistress is not the legitimate child of her father, but the daughter
of a quadroon girl, whom he
formerly owned. He has forged a will to obtain his own purposes, and
deprived poor mistress of
her natural rights. But, on the night when the villany was
perpetrated, I managed to obtain<pb n="112"/>
the true will, and to make my escape,—and a very narrow escape
it was, for I was
shot at and obliged to jump into the river to save my life. They
think the shot killed me; but I
shall yet expose their villany—"</p>
            <p>"Good gracious, I hope so!" exclaimed Uncle Nathan, whose
sympathies were awakened by
the brief narrative of the mulatto.</p>
            <p>"Now, it is scarcely prudent for me to retain possession of this
will. I may be discovered, or
drowned, or shot; and then my poor mistress would never be restored."</p>
            <p>"True," replied Uncle Nathan, appreciating his companion's
reasoning, and admiring his
warm devotion to his mistress.</p>
            <p>"I wish to place the will in the keeping of some trusty person,
who will guard it as his own
life,—who will deem no sacrifice too great to relieve the
distressed, and foil the wicked,"
said Hatchie, earnestly.</p>
            <p>"I will do the best I can."</p>
            <p>"Before I intrust it to you, I must feel that you will not only be
discreet, but that you will
labor to foil this wicked plot."</p>
            <p>"I will do everything I can," replied Uncle Nathan, warmly, for
his heart was touched at the
wrongs of Emily.</p>
            <p>"Then here is the will," said Hatchie, handing him the packet,
which he had taken the
precaution to envelop in oil-cloth. "Remember how much depends upon
your caution and
fidelity. God forgive me, if I have done wrong in giving it to you!"</p>
            <p>"You may depend upon me. I will take good care of the document.
But shan't I say anything
to the lady about it?"</p>
            <p>"Assure her, if you can without exposing yourself, that the will
is safe. It will give joy to her
heart to know that she has the means of restoration to her home and name."</p>
            <p>"I will see everything done about right; and I hope soon to meet
you in the land of liberty."</p>
            <p>"I shall never leave my mistress. I have been near her<pb n="113"/>
from her birth, and, though
only a slave, I feel that I was sent into the world for no other
purpose than to protect and serve
her. Liberty away from her has no charms for me."</p>
            <p>"Goodness!" ejaculated Uncle Nathan; "I never should have thought it!"</p>
            <p>Hatchie's devotion to his mistress, so eloquently expressed,
jostled rather rudely the
Northerner's prejudices concerning the treatment of slaves.</p>
            <p>The conversation was here interrupted by three taps on the deck
above them, produced by the
brogan of Pat Fegan.</p>
            <p>Hatchie recognized the preconcerted signal, and, abruptly
terminating his remarks, he leaped
into the box, drew on the lid, and left Uncle Nathan to find his way
out as best he could.</p>
            <p>"Whisht, now," said Pat, whispering down the hatch. "Jump up, Mr.
Binson!"</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan approached the hatchway, and endeavored to leap out,
an effort which was
assisted by Pat, who, rudely seizing him by the collar, jerked him
out with a violence that
threatened his bones with dissolution.</p>
            <p>"How the divil did yous tumble in there?" screamed Pat, as two
persons approached. "Are
yous hurted?"</p>
            <p>"A little," replied Uncle Nathan, perceiving the ruse of his coadjutor.</p>
            <p>"I fear yous are. Thry are your legs broke?" continued Pat, whose
energy of utterance gave a
fair appearance to the deceit.</p>
            <p>"Are you much hurt?" asked one of the persons who had by their
presence disturbed the
conference.</p>
            <p>"Very little," replied Uncle Nathan, who really felt the
uncomfortable effects of a knock on
the knee he had received in his involuntary ascent from the hold.</p>
            <p>"Bad luck to 't, but 't was a wicked fall!" said Pat, fearful that
his conscientious companion
would expose the deceit.</p>
            <p>"Can I render you any assistance?" asked one of the<pb n="114"/>
intruders, who were none
other than Maxwell and Vernon, whom we left on their way to the main deck.</p>
            <p>"Thank ye, I don't need any," replied Uncle Nathan, hobbling off,
accompanied by Pat.</p>
            <p>"Now, is the coast clear?" said Vernon, who carried a lantern he
had borrowed from the
mate.</p>
            <p>"All clear; but put out that light,—the engineers will
notice us," replied Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"But I can't find my way into the hold without it. There is no
danger of the engineers, They
are all asleep on the forward deck."</p>
            <p>"What do you want in the hold?" asked Maxwell, in an irritable tone.</p>
            <p>"I want to hide this bag of money," replied Vernon, in a whisper.
"As soon as the covey finds
he has been picked, they will search the boat; and my character is
not likely to save me from the
indignity of being obliged to open my trunk, and turn out my pockets."</p>
            <p>"It is bad business, and I wish you had not done this thing. As I
told you before, <emph>I</emph> have nothing to do with it. I feel
myself rather above common robbery."</p>
            <p>"Self-esteem! But you came down on your own business, not on mine.
You can return, and
not trouble yourself any further," growled Vernon.</p>
            <p>"I need your help, and will pay you for it."</p>
            <p>"Very well, then, wait till <emph>this</emph> job is finished."</p>
            <p>"Go on! I will follow," replied Maxwell, finding remonstrance vain.</p>
            <p>After a careful scrutiny of the premises, Vernon concealed his
lantern under his coat, and
leaped into the hold, followed by Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"Now," said Vernon, "I must put this bag into one of these boxes,
to be guarded by the spirits
of the brave men whose bones repose in them."</p>
            <p>"Are you mad, man? Would you open the coffins of the<pb n="115"/>
dead to hide your
ill-gotten gold?" exclaimed Maxwell, alarmed at the purpose of his
confederate.</p>
            <p>"Why not? We need not disturb the bodies,—only open the
outside box."</p>
            <p>"Very well," said Maxwell, who felt how useless it was to oppose
his companion. "But
remember, I have nothing to do with the robbery."</p>
            <p>"Of course not, and nothing to do with sharing the proceeds; but
sit down, if you have
anything to say to me. We are perfectly safe from interruption here;"
and Vernon seated himself
on the box which was occupied by the mulatto.</p>
            <p>"My words need not be many. In the first place, I have been
insulted, and must have
satisfaction; and, in the second, there is a girl in the cabin to
whom I am much attached, and she
will not give me the smallest sign of encouragement. Have her I must,
by fair means or foul. I
would marry her. You understand?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly; but what's the plan?" asked Vernon, indifferently.</p>
            <p>"Rather a difficult one, and may require some nerve to execute
it," replied Maxwell, who
proceeded to develop his schemes, both in respect to Henry Carroll
and to Emily.</p>
            <p>Although the conspirators spoke in a low tone, Hatchie heard and
understood the whole plot.
The voice of Maxwell he recognized, and, although the name of the
lady against whom his
designs were meditated was not mentioned, he comprehended who she was.</p>
            <p>The confederated scoundrels having finished their conference,
Vernon drew from his pocket
a small screw-driver, and proceeded to remove the screws from one of
the boxes, which, to
Hatchie's great relief, was not the one occupied by himself. After
much labor, for the boxes were
carefully constructed, to bear the rough usage of transportation, he
succeeded in removing the lid,
and deposited the bag of money between the coffin and the case which
enclosed it.</p>
            <pb n="116"/>
            <p>Having effected the object which brought them to the hold, the two ascended
again, and made their way to the cabin.</p>
            <p>In addition to the knowledge of the plot, Hatchie was made
acquainted with a fact which
afforded him much pleasure—that Henry Carroll, in defence of
his mistress, had knocked
Maxwell down. This was evidence in his favor. He also heard something
of the preference she
had bestowed upon him, and that on this account, more than for the
blow, he was to be the victim
of Maxwell's vengeance. But he resolved to foil both schemes.</p>

            <p>ON the second night of the Chalmetta's voyage,
as Henry was about to retire, the steward handed him a note. An hour
before he had struck a
"fashionable" man a severe blow, and he conjectured at once that it
had called forth this note. On
opening the billet, his supposition proved to be correct. It was a
challenge from Maxwell.</p>
            <p>We are very much opposed to duels and duelling, and we regret that
faithfulness to the facts
of history compels us to record that Captain Carroll accepted the
challenge. He had moral
courage enough to resist the promptings of that artificial spirit of
honor which encourages duels;
but there was "a lady in the case,"—a lady whom he fondly
loved. He felt that the insult
which she had received was not sufficiently punished. Besides, there
was an audacity about the
man which deserved to be punished, and he resolved to punish it. Poor
human nature! Henry
never reflected that he might be shot himself, and the persecutor of
innocence escape unharmed.
No; he felt that the blow he had struck in defence of innocence was a
just retribution, as far as it
went; and that he should fall, <emph>he</emph> who had espoused the
cause of innocence, why
it was simply impossible!</p>
            <p>He accepted the challenge, and requested a brother officer to act
as his "friend." The two
seconds—Major Brunn on<pb n="118"/>
the part of Henry, and Vernon on the part of
Maxwell—arranged the preliminaries.</p>
            <p>The boat would arrive at Natchez about daylight, and would remain
there long enough to
allow the meeting to take place.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll, though his chivalrous spirit was gratified at the
opportunity to revenge the
insult offered to Emily, was ill at ease. To meet a man of no
character (for such he supposed
Maxwell to be) was not a very ornamental accompaniment to an affair
of honor. He had a
hundred times braved death on the field of battle, but to die in a
duel with such a man seemed to
his now tranquillized mind anything but honorable. Emily had retired,
and he could not bid her
farewell. Perhaps he had seen her for the last time on earth, for the
possibility of being killed
himself tardily came to his mind. He wrote a long letter to Emily,
and another to Uncle Nathan.</p>
            <p>The worthy Northerner had produced a very favorable impression
upon his mind. He knew
his liberal soul, and the design of the letter was to interest him in
her favor,—to induce
him to conduct her to his Northern home.</p>
            <p>Henry returned to his couch with many painful doubts as to the
morality, and even the
expediency, of his course. But the feeling of honor—of false
honor—comforted
him, and, animated by its spirit, he even looked forward with pleasure upon his
revenge,—upon the death of his opponent. This would be in
accordance with the justice of
the case, and he flattered himself that justice, if it did not always
prevail, would triumph in this
instance. With such reflections he closed his eyes, and sunk to his
slumbers.</p>
            <p>The Chalmetta moved lazily on her course. Her lights had all been
extinguished, and the
idlers, who a few hours before had paced the decks, were now
slumbering in their berths, or on
the cabin floor. The clock over the clerk's office indicated the hour
of twelve. On the main deck
forward the sleepy firemen were languidly supplying the furnaces; the
<orig>engi-</orig>
               <pb n="119"/>
neers, less actively employed, had fallen asleep by the cylinders.</p>
            <p>On the after quarter, laying flat upon the deck, were two men
earnestly engaged in
conversation, in which the whispered brogue of Pat Fegan might have
been detected. After the
conversation had continued some time, one of them cautiously raised
his head, as if to penetrate
the gloom that enshrouded them. Satisfied that they were alone, the
two rose, and, without noise,
climbed up one of the posts to the gallery which surrounded the
cabin. Then, with a light step,
they passed on, and stopped before the state-room occupied by Vernon.</p>
            <p>"Are you sure this is his room?" asked Hatchie, in a smothered whisper.</p>
            <p>"Troth, I am, thin," responded his companion; "but be aisy, or you
'll wake him."</p>
            <p>"The worse for him," replied Hatchie, as his teeth ground together.</p>
            <p>Hatchie placed his hand upon the door, and softly opened it. The
sleeper heard him not. The
negro groped about the room until his hand rested upon some pistols
which lay on a trunk by the
side of the berth. These he took, and, handing two of them to Pat,
retained the third in his hand.
Closing the door, they proceeded, as they had come, to the main deck.</p>
            <p>Seating himself behind a heap of merchandise, Hatchie proceeded to
examine the pistols by
the light of a lantern which Pat had <emph>borrowed</emph> from the
sleeping engineers. The
pistols were of the common pattern used in duelling. Two of the three
were mates; and Hatchie
discovered, on examination, that neither of them were loaded with
ball. The third pistol, which
contained two balls, was very similar in form and size to the pair.
Hatchie extracted the balls
from this one, and loaded the pair with one ball each, leaving the
unmatched one blank. They
then carefully conveyed them<pb n="120"/>
to Vernon's state-room, and placed them on the trunk
precisely as they had found them.</p>
            <p>As had been premised, the Chalmetta arrived at Natchez about
daylight. Vernon, well
acquainted with all its localities, led the parties of the duel to a
retired place in the vicinity. The
distance was measured off, and the principals took the stations
assigned them.</p>
            <p>"Now be careful they do not see you do it," said Vernon, in a low,
careless tone.</p>
            <p>The pistols were handed to the principals, the signal was given,
and both fired nearly at the
same instant.</p>
            <p>"Confound it!" exclaimed Maxwell, dropping his pistol, and
grasping the left arm, which had
been hit by Henry's ball. "How does this happen?"</p>
            <p>But Vernon was as much confounded by this unexpected result of the
duel as his principal.
He had only time to protest that he had prepared the pistols as
agreed upon, when Major Brunn
arrived at the spot.</p>
            <p>On examining the wounded man, it was found that the ball had
struck the fleshy part of the
arm. The injury was very trifling. Maxwell was much astonished at
receiving a ball from his
opponent's pistol,—a circumstance which was owing entirely to
Hatchie's precaution on
the previous night. He had overheard the plan by which Maxwell was to
fire a ball at Henry, with
no danger of receiving one in return. Vernon had loaded the pair
without ball, and the single
pistol with two balls. Henry was to select from the pair; the third
was to be concealed upon the
person of Maxwell, who was to use it instead of the blank. Major
Brunn, supposing Vernon to be
a man of honor, had not insisted upon examining the charge in
presence of both seconds, and
thus everything had worked to the satisfaction of the confederates up
to the time of the firing. By
Hatchie's precaution, Henry held one of the two which were loaded
with ball, while Maxwell had
fired the blank.</p>
            <p>Maxwell was, as may be supposed, vexed and disconcerted<pb n="121"/>
at the result of the
duel; and, with an ill grace, he resolved to postpone his revenge to
another time, inasmuch as he
could not hope again to shoot at his foe in perfect safety.</p>
            <p>The party returned to the steamer just in season for her
departure. Maxwell's wound was
examined by the surgeon, and pronounced very slight. Henry was
rejoiced at this intelligence, for
the cold-blooded thoughts which had found a place in his heart had
departed, and his naturally
kind disposition resumed its sway. He was glad that the affair had
terminated without the loss of
life; glad that his conscience was not burdened with the blood of a
fellow-creature; glad, too, that
he had escaped unhurt. This last consideration was not a selfish one.
He felt that all the energy he
possessed he should require in the restoration of her he so tenderly loved.</p>
            <p>His first step, on returning to the steamer, was to destroy the
letters he had written to meet
the worst calamity which might befall him. Having occasion to open
his trunk, he discovered, to
his surprise, that it was unlocked. Further examination showed that
he had been robbed of all his
earthly possessions. This was a severe blow. The money was the
accumulation of two years'
service, and he was now penniless,—without even a sufficient
sum to pay his passage. He
immediately informed the captain of his loss, who gave him the
comfortable assurance that the
robber had probably gone ashore at Natchez. However, he caused a
thorough search of the boat
to be made; but, as may be supposed, the search was vain.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan sympathized with him in his loss,—not with
words alone, but
voluntarily proposed to lend him any amount he required; an offer
which Henry accepted with
gratitude.</p>
            <p>"I see you are acquainted with that lady you saved from drowning,"
said the worthy farmer,
after he had passed the loan to Henry. The duel had before been discussed and<pb n="122"/>
roundly condemned. The cause of the quarrel had introduced the fact
to which the farmer had
alluded.</p>
            <p>"I am. Her father was my best friend. I spent a few weeks with him
a short time before his
death."</p>
            <p>"O, ho!" thought Uncle Nathan, "I guess the black feller didn't
know that, or he would have
given the papers to him;" and he resolved to inform Hatchie of
Henry's presence.</p>
            <p>Descending, he soon discovered Pat Fegan, and, by his help, was
enabled to hold a
conference with Hatchie, who, now that it was daylight, talked
through a crevice in his box.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was anxious to know the result of the duel, which Uncle
Nathan imparted, to whom,
in return, the mulatto related the means he had used to foil the
attorney's purpose, which was
nothing less than murder. He also disclosed the particulars of the
second plot, which was to be
put in execution that night.</p>
            <p>The information the faithful slave had gained in relation to the
character of Henry's efforts
for his mistress made him quite willing to have him admitted into the
confidence of her secret
protectors.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan returned to the cabin, delighted with the idea of
sharing his responsibility with
Henry. But his first wish was to relieve the distress of Emily, who,
he rightly judged, was in
continued suffering, on account of the painful uncertainty which
shrouded her destiny.</p>
            <p>Emily rose on the morning of the duel in blissful ignorance of the
danger which Henry had
incurred on her account. She had passed a sleepless night, in the
most intense agony. Her eyes
were red and swollen with weeping, and her heart yet beat with
violence of her emotions. She felt
in the most intense degree the misery of her situation, to which she
failed not to give all its
weight. She had a friend—a brother—more than
brother—near, in the person
of Henry. That love which she allowed her fond heart to cherish was
like an oasis in the desert of
her misery. She loved him, and in<pb n="123"/>
this thought—in the delightful sensation
which accompanied it—she found her only solace.</p>
            <p>At breakfast she saw him again; again his speaking eyes told how
fondly his heart clung to
her; again his smile fanned her fevered brain, like the zephyr of
summer, into a dream of bliss.
Her heart led her back to the days when they had wandered together
over her father's plantation.
Then, restrained by the coyness of unrevealed love, each enjoyed a
happiness to which the other
was supposed to be a stranger.</p>
            <p>But the anguish of her painful position <emph>would</emph> come to
destroy the dream of
bliss, and dissipate the bright halo her imagination had cast before
her. She retired to her
state-room, to ponder again her unhappy lot. "Thy will be done,"
murmured she, as, throwing
herself into a chair, she resigned herself to the terrible reflection
that she was a slave and an
outcast. The bright dream of love was only a chimera, to make her
feel more deeply the terrible
reality.</p>
            <p>Whilst she was thus venting her anguish, she was roused from her
lethargy of grief by the
chambermaid, who had entered by the inner door.</p>
            <p>"Please, ma'am, a gentleman out in the cabin says he wants to
speak to you."</p>
            <p>"A gentleman wishes to speak to me? Did he send his name?"</p>
            <p>"No, ma'am. He said you wouldn't know him, if he did; so it was no
use to send it."</p>
            <p>"Pray, what looking gentleman is he?"—her mind reverting to
Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"Well, ma'am, he's a very respectable looking gentleman," answered
the girl, to whom Uncle
Nathan (for he was the person alluded to) had given half a dollar.
"I think he is a Yankee, by his
talk."</p>
            <p>"Pray, ask him to send his name."</p>
            <p>"Yes, ma'am," said the chambermaid, retiring.</p>
            <p>Emily was puzzled by the request, and, judging from the<pb n="124"/>
girl's description that it
could not be Maxwell, began to dread a new enemy.</p>
            <p>The chambermaid presently returned, and said the gentleman's name
was Benson.</p>
            <p>Emily's perplexity was not diminished, but she resolved to see the
applicant at the door of the
room, so that, if his errand was from Maxwell, she could easily
retire from his presence.
Accordingly she instructed the girl to show him to the door on the gallery.</p>
            <p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am," said Uncle Nathan, as soon as he
reached the position assigned
him; "you are Miss Dumont, I believe?"</p>
            <p>"The same," said she, as calmly as her fluttering heart would
permit. "May I beg to know
your business with me?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, ma'am." said Uncle Nathan, bluntly; "but don't be scart. I
know something of your
trials; and I trust the Lord will give you strength to endure them
with patience."</p>
            <p>"Really, sir, you astonish me! May I be allowed to ask how you
became acquainted with my
affairs?"</p>
            <p>"All in good time, ma'am; I have in my possession a document,
which, I 'm told, will set
matters all right with you."</p>
            <p>"What is it, sir?"—and Emily was still more astonished at
the singularity of the
adventure.</p>
            <p>"<emph>It is your father's will,</emph> ma'am," replied Uncle
Nathan, disdaining all
preface and preliminary to this important remark.</p>
            <p>"My father's will, sir! Impossible!"</p>
            <p>"Fact, ma'am. I will tell you all about it;" and Uncle Nathan
proceeded, in his own blunt way,
to relate his adventures in the hold.</p>
            <p>Emily listened with surprise and joy to the honest farmer's story.
When he had concluded,
although she did not give way to the joy of her heart, a change from
the depth of despair to the
pinnacle of happiness took place in her silent<pb n="125"/>
heart. How devoutly she thanked the
great Father who had watched over her in her anguish, and now shed a
halo of joy across her
darkened path! How earnest was the silent prayer which arose from the
depths of her heart, for
the safety of the faithful slave, who had perilled his life for her
happiness! How deeply laden
with the incense of gratitude was the song of thanksgiving which rose
from her soul to the Giver
of all good!</p>
            <p>And when Uncle Nathan told the story of the duel, a new song of
thanksgiving arose for
Henry's safety. The joy she felt in his preservation would not be
entirely confined to her heart,
and Uncle Nathan—unromantic bachelor as he was—could not
but discern the deep
interest she felt in him.</p>
            <p>The interview was concluded, and the worthy farmer left the
gallery more rejoiced than if he
had himself been declared heir of Colonel Dumont's millions; and he
looked around, as excited
as a school-boy on the first day of vacation, to find Henry, and
relate the good news.</p>

            <p>THE day of the duel was a day of happiness to
Emily Dumont. The restraint which Jaspar's presence imposed was
removed. Maxwell, from
prudence or some other motive, did not intrude upon her. Her heart
was rejoiced by the glad
tidings which Uncle Nathan had conveyed to her. Henry Carroll was
permitted to enjoy her
society. It was a day of bliss to both; and, though a crowded steamer
could ill afford the privacy
which new-born love ever seeks, yet opportunities of giving
expression to their feelings were not
wanting. All day long they revelled in the delightful emotions which
warmed their hearts. Their
intercourse was now burdened by no painful reflections on the misery
which had so lately
environed Emily. The means of her restoration to home and society
were at hand. The only
difficulty now was to discover the best method of establishing her
rights. Against Jaspar and
Maxwell they cherished no ill-will,—they had no desire to
punish them for their wicked
designs.</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan, too, was in the "full enjoyment of his mind." The
relief he had
"providentially" been able to afford to Emily's mind was the medium
of an abundant satisfaction.
As the darkness began to gather, he found an opportunity of
conversing with Henry, whose entire
devotion to Emily during the day had rendered him a stranger in the
gentlemen's cabin. The plot
which Hatchie had revealed to him had caused him but little anxiety.
Maxwell's wounded arm,<pb n="127"/>
he concluded, would delay its execution. But he gave the particulars
to Henry, who
was not at all satisfied that it would not be undertaken.</p>
            <p>"We must watch to-night," said he.</p>
            <p>"Sartain, we 'll keep a good look-out; but the scamp can't do
anything while he is wounded."</p>
            <p>"But he had confederates."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps he has. But here is another friend," said Uncle Nathan,
as he perceived Pat Fegan,
who had for some time been watching an opportunity to speak to him.</p>
            <p>"Sure, the naiger would like to spake wid yous," said Pat, in a whisper.</p>
            <p>"What 's the matter, Pat?" asked Henry.</p>
            <p>"Nothin', your honor," replied Pat, promptly; "I was only tellin'
this gintleman that a poor
divil was dhrunk on the lower deck, and he'd betther go and praych
timperance to him."</p>
            <p>"No, no, Partrick, that's too bad," interrupted Uncle Nathan,
reprovingly; "I must teach you
to tell the truth."</p>
            <p>Pat opened his eyes with astonishment when he heard Uncle Nathan
explain to Henry the
part he had borne in the drama, and was about to utter in plain Irish
his opinion of a man who
would thus betray a confidence, when Henry explained that he was an
old friend of Hatchie and
the lady.</p>
            <p>"Long life to your honor, if that be true!" exclaimed Pat; "and
you won't blow on the naiger?"</p>
            <p>"I have too strong an interest in him to do anything to his
injury," replied Henry. "But show
me the way to him, Pat."</p>
            <p>"One at a time, if yous plaze," said Pat, as he perceived Uncle
Nathan about to follow them.</p>
            <p>Pat led the way to the after part of the lower deck, to which
Hatchie had ascended, as on the
night of the rescue, to inhale the fresh air. This step was a safe
one in the night, as, if any one
approached (which was seldom), he could easily and speedily regain
his hiding-place.</p>
            <pb n="128"/>
            <p>"Hould aisy," said Pat, as they approached the fugitive; "don't be
afraid,—I
have brought yous a frind."</p>
            <p>"I hope you will not bring me too many friends," replied Hatchie,
a little disconcerted.</p>
            <p>"Don't you know me?" said Henry, as he grasped the hand of
Hatchie; "I have just come
from your mistress, and know your whole story."</p>
            <p>"Not all," replied Hatchie; "you cannot know how much anxiety I
have endured. Miss Emily
is not yet safe."</p>
            <p>"But we can easily foil the villain's future designs."</p>
            <p>"We will, at least, endeavor to do so."</p>
            <p>"I believe I have seen you before; we were companions in the rescue."</p>
            <p>"We were, and God bless you for the noble service you rendered my
mistress!"</p>
            <p>"That service was all your own, my gallant fellow."</p>
            <p>"You undervalue your own efforts. He who gets into the Mississippi
seldom gets out alive.
Without your timely assistance, I tremble to think of what might have
been the end. My
experience of the river enabled me to bring her up; but without your
aid at the moment it came I
do not think I could have saved her. But this is all past. Thank God,
she is yet safe, though
another danger hovers over her."</p>
            <p>"This foul conspiracy,—will they put it in execution to-night?"</p>
            <p>"I heard the villain they call Vernon, an hour ago, engage a deck
hand to help him row the
boat."</p>
            <p>"Then there is indeed danger. I had thought Maxwell's wound would
have prevented it for a
season."</p>
            <p>"A mere scratch. I would your ball had found the villain's heart,
if he has one. But Vernon is
the most dangerous man—a more accomplished villain."</p>
            <p>"Vernon," said Henry, musing; "he was Maxwell's second."</p>
            <p>"Yes. That duel was a plot to murder you."</p>
            <p>"How so?"</p>
            <pb n="129"/>
            <p>Hatchie explained the plan of Vernon, which had been rendered futile by his
precaution.</p>
            <p>"The scoundrel! but how knew you this, and how happens it that I
escaped while he is
wounded?" said Henry.</p>
            <p>"I overheard the plot when I did the other. Vernon is a common
robber. He came into the
hold to conceal a bag of money he had stolen."</p>
            <p>"A bag of money!" interrupted Henry, his thoughts diverted from
the subject.</p>
            <p>"Ay, a bag of money."</p>
            <p>"Do you know where they hid it?"</p>
            <p>"I do; but why do you ask?" and Hatchie was much pained to
discover in Henry what he
mistook for a feeling of rapacity. He wanted and expected the
perfection of an angel in the man
who sustained the relation of lover and protector to his mistress.</p>
            <p>"Because I have been robbed of all I had in the world," replied
Henry, seeing the shade upon
Hatchie's brow.</p>
            <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the mulatto, his doubts removed, and pleased
in being able to restore his
money.</p>
            <p>"The money is undoubtedly mine. Your noble devotion to your
mistress has thus proved a
fortunate thing for me. But about the pistols?"</p>
            <p>Hatchie related the means he had used to derange Maxwell's plan.</p>
            <p>"I shall never be able to repay the debt I owe you," said Henry,
warmly, as the mulatto
finished his story.</p>
            <p>"I aid it for my mistress' sake. I learned that you were her friend."</p>
            <p>"And she will bless you for the act."</p>
            <p>"Now, what shall be done to insure her safety to-night? for they
will attempt her abduction, I
doubt not."</p>
            <p>It was arranged that Henry should watch in the vicinity of Emily's
state-room, while Uncle
Nathan, Hatchie and Pat Fegan, should occupy the lower deck. Emily
was not to be informed of
the danger; it would distress her to no purpose.<pb n="130"/>
They had no doubt of their ability to
protect her. Accustomed as Henry was to danger, perhaps he did not
fully appreciate that which
was now gathering around Emily. He felt that, in knowing the
particulars of the nefarious
scheme, he was abundantly able, even single-handed, to prevent its success.</p>
            <p>Obtaining a screw-driver and a lantern from one of the engineers,
he succeeded in obtaining
possession of his stolen bag of gold. On his return to the cabin, he
observed Vernon standing at
the bar, and the temptation to give his moral faculties a start could
not be resisted. Purchasing a
dozen cigars, he remarked that he had no change, and coolly pulled
the bag of gold from his
pocket. Vernon's astonishment and consternation could not be entirely
concealed, as he
recognized the bag he had securely deposited in the box with the
dead. Henry took no notice of
him, though he heard him say, in a suppressed tone, "The devil is in
this boat!"</p>
            <p>Henry sought his state-room, where he found Uncle Nathan
impatiently waiting to hear the
result of the interview.</p>
            <p>"There is danger," said Henry, "and we must be ready to do our
duty manfully."</p>
            <p>"Good gracious! you don't say so!" exclaimed Uncle Nathan.</p>
            <p>"We must watch to-night, and, if need be, fight!"</p>
            <p>"How you talk! You don't think the feller with the sore arm will
try to do anything to-night?"</p>
            <p>"I fear he will;" and Henry opened his trunk, and took therefrom a
pair of revolvers.</p>
            <p>"Gracious! will there be any need of pistols? Couldn't you reason
with them?" exclaimed
Uncle Nathan, who, as before hinted, had a great repugnance to the
use of deadly weapons.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid they will not listen to reason," said Henry, smiling,
in spite of his anxiety. "If
action is necessary, it must be prompt. I know your heart, my good
friend, and I trust your
non-resistant notions will not interfere with your duty. I must rely
on your aid in this affair."</p>
            <pb n="131"/>
            <p>"Sartain. I will do all I can, if I die for it. But I think I can
get along very well
without one of them 'ere things," said Uncle Nathan, eying the
pistols with distrust.</p>
            <p>"Very well, I shall not urge you, though I think it would be
prudent for you to have one. As
you go to your station, you will oblige me by giving this one to the
mulatto boy."</p>
            <p>"Sartain, cap'n," replied Uncle Nathan, taking the pistol; "I an't
exactly a non-resistance man,
only I hate to use pistols;—not that I'm afeered on 'em; but to
take a feller-cretur's life is a
dreadful thing. You know the New Testament says, 'Resist not evil,'
and——"</p>
            <p>"Yes, I remember; but now is the time to act, and not to preach. I
shall place myself near
Miss Dumont's state-room, and your party will see that the stern-boat
is not disturbed."</p>
            <p>"All right, cap'n, but do be careful about spilling blood!" said
Uncle Nathan, who did not like
the cool, determined air with which Henry handled his pistols.</p>
            <p>"Be assured I will not wantonly take the life of even the most
hardened villain; but in defence
of Miss Dumont I shall consider that the end will justify the means."</p>
            <p>Uncle Nathan went to his post, and Henry, muffling himself in a
large camp-cloak, seated
himself near Emily's door. Accustomed as he was to the perils and
privations of the camp, the
duty before him did not seem difficult or irksome. To his chivalrous
spirit there was a pleasure in
thus watching over an innocent being, while she slept, unconscious of
the danger that menaced
her. Lighting his cigar, he resigned himself to the dream of blissful
anticipations, which relieved
the monotony of the scene.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, in the seclusion of his state-room, had thoroughly
digested the plan for the
abduction of Emily. Vernon had arranged the details, and the lawyer's
reflections suggested no
material alteration. His wounded arm was a hindrance, but time was
too precious to admit of
delay. The Chalmetta was so tardy in her movements that Jaspar must
soon overtake them, and
then the opportunity would be lost.</p>
            <pb n="132"/>
            <p>If he could get Emily into his power, and away from the influences which now
surrounded her, he doubted not he could induce her, by threats or
persuasion, to become his wife;
then he would spring the trap upon Jaspar, and the coveted object of
his existence would be
gained. He had already forged a bill of sale of her person, and, thus
provided with an implement
of coercion, he doubted not that success would crown his efforts.</p>
            <p>As the evening advanced, and the passengers had mostly retired for
the night, Maxwell and
Vernon left the state-room, and went aft to examine more particularly
the means of descent to the
lower deck. As they approached Emily's state-room, they perceived
Henry puffing away at his
second cigar. Had it been any other person, Maxwell would not have
devoted a thought to him. It
was he with whom he had fought the duel,—whom a mysterious
providence seemed to
protect. Was he there by accident or design?</p>
            <p>The two confederates passed round the gallery, and returned to the
cabin. A long hour they
waited, and the cabin clock pointed to the hour of twelve; still
Henry had not changed his
position. His cigar was consumed, but there he sat like a statue,
obstinately obstructing the
completion of Maxwell's designs. The confederates began to fear he
had some knowledge of
their contemplated project. Yet how could this be? The plan had been
arranged in the hold of the
steamer. It was impossible that any one, even the men they had hired
to row the boat, could know
their intentions. Vernon, who had seen the stolen bag of money
miraculously restored to its
owner, who had seen two balls pass harmlessly through him, was
perfectly willing to believe that
Henry Carroll was the devil! But, devil or not, it was all the same to him.</p>
            <p>It was already time to commence operations. Vernon was impatient
to begin; for, as he
averred, he did not like to lose a whole night's sleep in so small an
affair. But nothing could be
done while Henry retained his present position,<pb n="133"/>
unless they silenced him by force; and
he seemed an ugly customer.</p>
            <p>The Chalmetta pursued her way, stemming with difficulty, as it
would seem by her lazy
pace, the current of the mighty river. She had just passed Vicksburg.
The night was dark and
gloomy. Those bright, beautiful moons, with which the
panorama-mongers are wont to gild the
eddying current, and solemnize the scenery with a pale loveliness,
were not in the ascendant.
Even the bright stars were hid by the thick clouds. The darkness cast
a sad gloom over the scene,
which a few hours before had been "leaping in light, and alive with
its own beauty." The yellow
bank rose high on either side of the river, and formed a sombre wall,
which seemed to keep the
sojourner on the tide a prisoner from the world above.</p>
            <p>Yet, deep as was the darkness, and perilous as was the navigation
of the river, the Chalmetta
sluggishly pursued her upward course, shunning sand-bars and snags
which the eye could not
see, and which the stranger knew not of. Now she crept, like a thief
at night, so closely beneath
the high bank that her tall chimneys almost swept the overhanging
branches; then, stealing from
the treacherous shoal, she sped her way through the middle of the
vast waters, as if ashamed of
her former timidity. Here she shot through the narrow cut-off, and
there left her foaming surge in
the centre of the broad expanse.</p>
            <p>On board all was still, save the puffing blasts of steam, which,
at each stroke of the pistons,
echoed through the woods and over the plains. The cabin lights had
long been extinguished, and,
from a distance, nothing could be seen of her but the huge blazing
furnaces, and the red signal
lantern, which was suspended over the boiler deck. The firemen, just
roused from their dream of
comfort, no more passed round the coarse jest, no more whistled
"Boatman, dance," but, like
automata, threw the fuel into the roaring furnaces. Occasionally, the
startling note of the great
bell roused the deck-watch from his slumber, and he sang over<pb n="134"/>
again the monotonous
song that told the pilot how far his keel was from the sands below.
Again the bell pealed a heavy
stroke, which indicated that the steamer was in free water, and the
leadsman settled himself for
another nap.</p>
            <p>The passengers, save those whom we have before noted, were deep in
the arms of Morpheus,
rejoicing, no doubt, in their dreams, over the many tedious hours
they thus annihilated.</p>
            <p>Wakeful and watchful, Henry Carroll still kept his post. Ever
present to his mind was the fair
being over whose safety his vigil was kept. Her image, clothed in all
the gorgeous fancies which
the love-sick brain conjures up, spoke in silver tones to his heart,
and the melody of her voice
thrilled his soul. Descending from the dignity of the man, he built
childish air-castles, wherein he
throned his idol, and in a few fleeting moments squandered years of
happiness by her side. The
perils of the past, the sternness of the present, the
responsibilities of the future, all faded away,
and from their ashes rose the bright empress of his soul.</p>
            <p>This, we know, was all very foolish of him; but then it must be
remembered he was in love,
and men in love can scarcely be called accountable beings.</p>
            <p>Thus he dreamed, and thus he trod the fairy ground of imagination,
nor heeded the creaking
timbers and the increasing rapidity of the puffs from the
escape-pipe. To a man not intoxicated
by the dream of young love these facts would have indicated a great
increase in the speed of the
boat; but he noticed them not.</p>
            <p>By the motions of the Chalmetta it was plain that, though
incapable of accomplishing any
wonderful feat in the attainment of speed, she had a considerable
amount of that commodity
somewhat vulgarly termed "spunk." As she passed the mouth of the
Yazoo river, another
steamer, apparently of her own calibre, rounded gracefully into the
channel, from a wood-yard.
This boat—the Flatfoot, No. 3—seemed, by her straining
and puffing, to throw the
gauntlet to the <orig>Chal-</orig>
               <pb n="135"/>
metta; a challenge, real or
imaginary, which the latter made haste to accept,—or, rather,
her sleepy firemen did, for,
without leave or license, they crammed her furnaces to their utmost
capacity. The effects of this
movement were soon perceptible in every part of the boat, for she
creaked and groaned like a
ship in a gale. But the Flatfoot, No. 3, had the lead, and seemed to
gain upon her rival,—a
circumstance which seemed to rouse the lethargic firemen of the
Chalmetta to the highest pitch
of excitement, for they packed the furnaces more closely still.</p>
            <p>Maxwell saw, with much satisfaction, the prospect of a race; not
that he expected in this
instance to enjoy the excitement which, with "fast men," is
consequent upon such an occasion.
He hoped it might distract the attention of the person who, by
accident or design, opposed the
execution of his purpose. He had sent Vernon to the cabin to watch
the movements of Henry,
while he remained upon the main deck, forward of the furnaces, to
encourage the firemen in their
ambitious project of passing the other boat. Several barrels of hams
which lay upon the deck the
apparently excited attorney ordered the firemen to throw into the
furnaces, promising to screen
them from blame by paying the owner double their value. The firemen,
not blessed with an
undue amount of caution, willingly obeyed the order, and soon the
boilers hissed and groaned
under the extraordinary pressure. The engineers, roused from their
slumbers, and entering at once
into the sport, secured the safety-valve in its place by attaching to
the lever double the usual
weight.</p>
            <p>Still the person whom Maxwell wished to lure from his post
remained immovable. A few
pitch-barrels were now split up, and cast into the furnaces, which so
increased the pressure that
the faithful safety-valve refused longer to endure the curb placed
upon the discharge of its
function. It was again secured, and the reckless firemen, urged on by
Maxwell and the engineers,
still pressed the boat to its destruction.</p>
            <pb n="136"/>
            <p>The boilers, notwithstanding the tremendous pressure to which they were
subjected, still realized the expectations of the confident
engineers, and refused to be the agents
of an "awful calamity." But all exertion was of no avail; the
Flatfoot, No. 3, whose tall chimneys
vomited forth a long trail of flame, showing that she, too, was hard
pressed, was rapidly
increasing her distance. Still the firemen plied the furnaces, and
again the engineers added more
weight to the lever of the safety-valve. The boilers were evidently
pressed to their utmost, the
decks were hot, and her timbers creaked and snapped as though they
would drop out of her.</p>
            <p>Hatchie had placed his party in the hold, one of which was on the
look-out at the hatchway.
He saw the danger of the steamer; but all his friends were in the
safest places the boat afforded. It
was an anxious hour for him; but everybody was in peril, and there
was no remedy.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, whose excitement in the race was feigned, perceived that
the boat was in imminent
danger. He had not intended to carry the excitement quite so far. An
explosion was not exactly
the thing he desired. It would not be sufficiently discriminating in
its choice of victims. But the
firemen were too much excited to listen to reason; therefore he
proceeded, with Vernon, towards
the extreme after part of the boat. Passing round the gallery of the
ladies' cabin, they perceived
that Henry had, at last, left his post. Such was indeed the case.
Roused from his abstraction by
the terrible anticipation of an explosion, he had gone forward to
reason with the pilots on the
recklessness of their course in allowing the boat to be so hard pressed.</p>
            <p>"Now is our time," said Maxwell, in a whisper.</p>
            <p>"Here goes, then!" replied Vernon.</p>
            <p>"Be careful that you do not injure her,—and bring her clothes."</p>
            <p>"Ay, ay! Have the boat ready quick, for, if I mistake not, the
sooner we are out of this boat
the better."</p>
            <pb n="137"/>
            <p>The ruffian approached the door of Emily's state-room and was
about to open it,
when, with a noise louder than the crashing of the thunderbolt, the
starboard boiler exploded, and
the Chalmetta lay a shapeless wreck upon the waters!</p>

and relieve the monotony of
the scenery. These islands are, for the most part, covered with a
luxurious growth of cotton-wood
trees. They have generally been formed by what are technically called
cut-offs, or new channels,
from the main land. The mighty torrent, scorning its own well-beaten
track, ploughs a way
through the country, and returns to its channel miles below, opening
at once a new path for the
voyager upon its tide. The portion of land thus separated from the
main shore is often subdivided
by the action of the waters into several smaller islands. These
islets are, however, oftener seen in
isolated positions, varying in area from a few square rods to several
acres. A remarkable feature
of these islands is their <emph>locomotive</emph> powers,—for,
strange as it may seem,
they annually take a step down stream! Observation has shown a change
of position almost
incredible.</p>
            <p>The river, continually wearing upon the up-river side of the
island, washes the sands and soil
to the lower side. Thus, the situation of the island is actually
changed. The fact is clearly shown
by the singular configuration of the mass of trees growing upon them.
The wood on the
up-stream side of the island is of the largest size; while that on
the down-stream side begins at
the mere shrub, and, by a<pb n="139"/>
regular gradation in height, like a pair of stairs, increases to
the altitude of the full-grown tree. Each successive year places a
new layer of soil upon the lower
side, in which the young tree takes root; and the growth of each year
is distinctly visible to the
traveller as he ascends the river.</p>
            <p>On one of these islands, above Vicksburg, was located a neat
cottage. The island differed in
many respects from others. Its area might have been eight or ten
acres. On one side of it was a
narrow, but deep stream, which, entering from the broad river,
described a semi circle, and
returned its waters on the same side. On three sides, except at the
mouths of the little stream, the
island was rendered inaccessible by the high banks, while on the
fourth side the shrubs grew so
luxuriantly as to be impervious, save to the most resolute visitor.
From the high banks which
walled it in the surface of the island sloped gradually towards a
common centre, through which
rushed the little stream.</p>
            <p>This little island had probably been a part of the main land; the
river had forced its way
through a valley, and, by degrees, had worn down the high land on
either side, till they formed
the precipices which now frowned on the visitor. The little stream
had, perhaps, once been a
meandering rivulet,—part of one which emptied into the river on
the opposite side.</p>
            <p>On one of the sloping sides of the interior was situated the
cottage. It was small in size,
containing but four rooms and an attic, and was neatly painted white.
Its location in the valley
concealed it from the main land, and from the traveller upon the
river. It was accessible only by
means of the stream, which rolled by within a few rods of the door. A
cow grazed in the woods,
which had been partly cleared of underbrush, and had the appearance
of a park grove. Near the
house a plot of land had been reduced to a state of cultivation, upon
which an old negro servant
managed to raise vegetables sufficient for the use of the family.</p>
            <p>The interior of the cottage was neatly furnished, though<pb n="140"/>
with none of the gaudy
trappings of fashion. Everything was plain and useful. On the side
fronting the stream, which
served the inmates as a highway, were two rooms,—a library,
which was also the
sitting-room, and a sleeping apartment. The library was far the most
substantial and
comfortable-looking room in the house, inasmuch as it was abundantly
supplied with modern
and classical lore. In the middle was a large writing-desk, upon
which lay sundry manuscripts,
apparently the last labor of the occupant. The books and papers were
all arranged with
scrupulous neatness and method.</p>
            <p>The two rooms in the rear were the dining-room and another
sleeping apartment, while the
attic was occupied by the old negro and his wife,—the property
of the proprietor, and his
only attendants upon the island. Back of the house, as is the custom
of the South, was a small
building used as a kitchen. Near it was another building,
appropriated to the use of the cow
aforesaid.</p>
            <p>In the stream in front of the cottage, fastened to a tree on the bank, was a
beautifully-modelled sail-boat, which was worthy to rank with the
miniature yachts of our large
cities. She was schooner-rigged, with a small cabin forward. Her
masts, by an ingenious
contrivance, could be lowered down aft, and, by means of a rope
attached to the fore-top, and
running through a block on the bowsprit, could be instantly restored
to their original upright
position. This arrangement the owner found necessary, on account of
the overhanging trees,
which nearly concealed the two openings of the stream into the river.</p>
            <p>On the night of the Chalmetta's terrible disaster, a man wrapped
in a camlet cloak left the
cottage, and approached the landing-place. In one hand he carried a
glass lantern, and in the other
a double-barrelled gun. Descending the steps to the rude pier of
logs, he drew the boat in-shore
and seated himself in the stern-sheets. Unloosing the stern-line,
which alone held her, the boat
was borne on by the rapid<pb n="141"/>
stream. The helm the occupant handled with a masterly
skill, and in a moment the little bark swept through the half-hid
opening into the broad river.
Placing the helm amid-ships, the man went forward, and, pulling the
proper line, brought the
masts to their upright position. He then inserted the iron keys which
kept them in their place, and
hoisted the sails. By this time the boat had drifted to the lower
extremity of the island; so,
bracing her sharp up, he stood away across the river. Tacking before
he reached the swift
channel, which flowed close in shore, he laid the boat's course up
the stream. The wind was
blowing fresh, and, notwithstanding the contending force of the
current, the boat careened to her
task, and made very good progress through the water. While the
gallant little bark pursues her
way, we will introduce her skipper to the reader.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier was about fifty years of age. He was descended from
one of the old French
families of Louisiana; and had been, for nearly thirty years, a
practising physician in the city of
New Orleans, during which time he had accumulated a very handsome
fortune. At the age of
twenty-five he had been married to a lady, whose only recommendations
were her personal
beauty and her fashionable accomplishments. Her vanity had disgusted
him, and her
uncontrollable temper had embittered to its very dregs the cup of his
existence. Being naturally
of a gloomy and melancholy temperament, this unfortunate union had
rendered his life almost
insupportable. Domestic happiness, to which he had looked forward
with high-wrought
anticipations, proved, in his case, to have no foundation.</p>
            <p>He was disappointed. His dream of home and its blessings faded
away, and was supplanted
by a terrible reality. He grew more and more melancholy. But there
was a solace, which saved
him from absolute misery. Two children—a boy and a
girl—blessed his otherwise
unhallowed union. The education of these children was the only joy his home<pb n="142"/>
afforded; but even this to his misanthropic mind could not compensate
for his matrimonial
disappointment.</p>
            <p>Years passed away; the son was sent to college, from which, to the
anguish of his father, he
was expelled for gross misconduct. The young man returned to New
Orleans, and became one of
the most dissolute and abandoned characters of the city. Dr.
Vaudelier disowned him, and sunk
the deeper in his melancholy.</p>
            <p>The death of his wife left him alone with his daughter; and if the
fatal influence of past years
could have been removed, perhaps he might have been a happy man. The
daughter was a
beautiful girl, and promised to realize all the fond expectations of
her father. Her daily education
and method of life, as directed by her father, were better calculated
to fit her for the occupancy of
a nun's cell than for rational society.</p>
            <p>About five years previous to the time of our story, the solemn
quiet of Dr. Vaudelier's
dwelling was disturbed by the arrival of a young French gentleman,
bearing letters of
introduction to the misanthropic physician. This gentleman was
delighted with the daughter of
his host, and she experienced a before unknown pleasure in his
society. The doctor was, to some
extent, obliged to abandon the "pleasures of melancholy," and
accompany the young couple into
the world.</p>
            <p>This intimacy between the young persons rapidly ripened into love.
Dr. Vaudelier's inquiries
into the character and circumstances of the young gentleman were not
satisfactory, and he
refused to sanction the union. Perhaps he was influenced more in this
decision by the dread of
parting with his daughter than by any other motive. The father's
refusal was followed by the
elopement of the young couple,—an act which blasted the only
remaining hope of the
misanthrope. His heart was too sensitive to endure the shock.</p>
            <p>Reduced to the depths of despair, suicide presented itself as the
only effectual remedy for his
misfortunes. But the<pb n="143"/>
church, to whose rites and promises he yielded the most devoted
reverence, doomed the suicide to eternal woe!</p>
            <p>Society, into which for a brief period he had allowed himself to
be enticed, was ten-fold
more distasteful to him than before. He could not endure even that
which the practice of his
profession demanded. The great city seemed a pandemonium, and he
resolved to escape from its
hated scenes.</p>
            <p>He travelled up the river in search of seclusion, and accidentally
had noticed the island upon
which he afterwards fixed his residence.</p>
            <p>His abode upon the island was not entirely unknown to the
inhabitants of his vicinity; yet
they seldom troubled him with their presence. Steamers and flat-boats
continually passed his
little domain; yet the traveller knew not that it was occupied by
human beings.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier's pursuits were of the most simple nature. He read
and wrote nearly the whole
day, and in the evening,—often at the dead of night,—he
would unmoor his yacht,
and stem the tide of the mighty river. His chief happiness was in
communion with nature. His
solitary habits had completely estranged him from society; and he
chose the night for his lonely
excursions on the river, to avoid the presence of man.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier was a benevolent man; and his benevolence was still
his friend. It kept his
heart from corroding, or becoming entirely cold. His professional
services he freely gave to the
poor "squatter," woodman and boatman, whenever he could learn that
they were needed. The old
negro made frequent visits to the shore to procure provisions and
other necessaries, and informed
his master if any of his indigent neighbors needed his aid. Dr.
Vaudelier, as far as he was known,
was regarded with profound respect and affection, and none were
disposed to disturb his privacy
when it was understood that entire seclusion was his desire.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier reclined on the cushions in the stern-sheets of his
boat. With an abstracted
mind he gazed upon the<pb n="144"/>
gloomy outlines of the shore. Nature in this sombre dress
seemed in unison with the gloom of his own soul. Scarcely conscious
of his actions, he managed
the boat with the most consummate skill, avoiding the unseen shoal
and the unfavorable current,
but still never allowing the sails to shiver. Far ahead of him he
descried the blazing chimneys of
a steamer. It was night, and he was secure from the prying gaze or
the rude hail of the voyagers.</p>
            <p>His reflections were gloomy. He reviewed his earlier years. He
thought of his affectionate
daughter, who had promised to be the stay of his declining years,
perhaps at that moment a
wanderer and an outcast. He had heard nothing of her since her
departure. He had made no effort
to ascertain her fate. He considered his whole course of conduct to
her, the nature of the
education he had imparted to her, the example he had set for her
imitation. His reflections were
not altogether satisfactory, and kindled a few compunctious thoughts.
The blame had not been all
on the side of the daughter. His misanthropic character was the
origin of some part of it.</p>
            <p>Thus he mused, and thus dawned upon his mind the first gleams of
repentance. His
melancholy temperament had caused the loss of his daughter; and, for
the time, it grew
repugnant. He felt that he was not living the life his Maker intended
he should live.</p>
            <p>His meditations were suddenly interrupted by a tremendous
explosion, and he was at once
satisfied that it proceeded from the steamer he had before observed.
His supposition was soon
verified by the flames he saw rising from the spot where he had last
seen her. She was, he
judged, at least three miles distant. His benevolent disposition,
stimulated by the reflection, and,
perhaps by some unconscious resolution of the previous hour, prompted
him to hasten to her
relief. Leaving the helm, he took from the little cabin a stay-sail,
and by the light of the lantern
attached it to the lines and hoisted it. The lively little craft,
feeling the <orig>addi-</orig>
               <pb n="145"/>
tional impulse, careened till her gunnel was nearly submerged, and cut
her way with increased velocity through the unfavorable current. Half
an hour elapsed before he
approached near enough to make out the condition of the shattered
steamer. Another steamer lay
as near to her as the flames, which had apparently been partly
subdued, would permit. Men were
busily engaged in throwing on water, and their efforts promised to be
crowned with success, for
the volume of flame was rapidly decreasing. A line was passed from
the bow of the Chalmetta to
the Flatfoot, No. 3 (for these were the steamers), which enabled the
latter to control the drift of
the former. Dr. Vaudelier was too far off, however, to form a very
correct idea of the casualty.</p>
            <p>Portions of the wreck were floating by him, and occasionally his
boat struck against a timber
or cask. While anxiously straining his vision, to ascertain further
particulars of the disaster, he
heard a faint cry close ahead of him. By the light of his lantern,
which he had hung up by the
foremast, to attract the eye of any sufferer who might need aid, he
saw a man clinging to a barrel
floating by him. Hastily letting go the halyards, the fore and main
sails came down, the boat was
put about, and Dr. Vaudelier, with much exertion, succeeded in saving
the almost dying sufferer.
Conveying him to the cabin, which was of sufficient size to contain
two berths, he placed him
upon one of them, and proceeded to ascertain his ailments. These, as
far as he could discover
them, consisted of a broken arm, a severe contusion of the head, and
several severe scalds. The
wounded man's endeavors to aid in his own rescue had been too
violent, and on being placed in
the berth he had fainted. After administering such relief as he was
able, he returned to the
sternsheets, hoisted the sails, and the boat, which had been drifting
down-stream, again
approached the wreck.</p>
            <p>The flames of the Chalmetta were now extinguished. Before the
benevolent physician could
reach her, the Flatfoot had taken her in tow, and both were rapidly
leaving him.<pb n="146"/>
Further pursuit was useless; so, taking in the stay-sail, he put the
boat about, and again turned his
attention to the sufferer.</p>
            <p>The boat's progress, assisted by the current, was very rapid, and
she soon reached the island.
The experienced eye of her manager discerned through the darkness the
narrow opening of the
little stream. Taking in the sails and lowering the masts, the little
craft glided through the rivulet,
and in less time than is taken to relate it was securely moored in
front of the cottage. The old
negro, bewildered by the unseasonable summons, assisted in conveying
the wounded stranger to
the cottage.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier, after a more thorough examination of his patient
than he had been able to
make before, was pleased to find that his wounds, though serious,
were not of a dangerous
character. He set the broken arm, and, by the exercise of the great
skill for which he had been
distinguished, restored him to consciousness, and made sure his
future recovery.</p>
            <p>"Where is she? Is she safe?" murmured the sufferer, as his
returning consciousness afforded a
partial knowledge of his condition. "Where am I?"</p>
            <p>"You are among friends, sir,—among friends. Do not distress
yourself," replied the
doctor, in a soothing tone.</p>
            <p>"Where is she? Great God! what has become of her?" exclaimed the
wounded man, with
startling energy.</p>
            <p>"You must be quiet, sir, or you will injure your arm," said Dr.
Vaudelier, mildly restraining
the excited man.</p>
            <p>"O, Emily, Emily!" groaned the sufferer. "Why did I leave you? Why
did we not perish
together?"</p>
            <p>"Be calm, sir,—be calm! You have lost a friend in this
terrible disaster?"</p>
            <p>"I have. O that I could have died with her!"</p>
            <p>"Are you sure she has perished?"</p>
            <p>"She could scarcely have survived the explosion."</p>
            <p>"Was she not in the ladies' cabin?"</p>
            <pb n="147"/>
            <p>"She was."</p>
            <p>"Then probably she is safe. The ladies' cabin was thrown from its
position; but it appeared to
be comparatively but little shattered. The forward cabin was blown
entirely in pieces."</p>
            <p>"Thank God for this intelligence!" ejaculated Henry
Carroll,—for the reader has
already discovered that it was he whom the doctor had rescued.</p>
            <p>"Another steamer was close at hand, so that probably most of the
ladies were saved, unless,
as is often the case, they jumped overboard in their fright."</p>
            <p>"Heaven protect her!" exclaimed Henry.</p>
            <p>"But, sir, I must insist on perfect quiet. Your condition
imperatively demands it. To-morrow
everything shall be done to relieve your anxiety. We shall then
receive Vicksburg papers, which
will contain the names of all who are lost."</p>
            <p>"I will try to be quiet, but I cannot but be anxious till I know
the whole truth."</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier again applied a soothing balm to the scalded
portions of his body, and gave
him a powerful narcotic, the effects of which were soon visible in a
deep, troubled slumber.</p>

            <p>IN a small log-cabin, a few miles above "Cottage
Island," reposing upon a rude bed, on the morning of the Chalmetta's
disaster, was a young and
beautiful female. She was pale and in tears, evidently suffering the
most excruciating mental
agony. An old woman, from whose bosom her half-civilized mode of life
had not entirely
banished those refined sympathies which belong by intuition to her
sex, was vainly striving to
impart comfort.</p>
            <p>"You ought to be thankful, ma'am, that you wan't blowed up, with
the rest of the poor
people," said she, kindly, attempting to turn the lady's attention
from her absorbing misery.</p>
            <p>"I had rather a thousand times have perished than fallen into the
hands of the villain who
rescued me," replied Emily,—it was she—with a shudder.</p>
            <p>"O, ma'am, they shan't hurt a hair of your head. My old man
wouldn't see such a good cretur
as you hurt, for all the world."</p>
            <p>"Alas! I fear his power will not avail against this hardened villain."</p>
            <p>"Never you fear, ma'am! Two sich popinjays as them couldn't skeer
my Jerry, nohow.
Besides, my son, Jim, will be back in an hour or two."</p>
            <pb n="149"/>
            <p>"I fear they cannot aid me."</p>
            <p>"Yes, they can. My Jerry alone would turn 'em inside out, if they
are sarcy."</p>
            <p>"I can scarcely hope the villains—"</p>
            <p>"Softly, lady, softly! do not be harsh!" said Maxwell, entering
the apartment in which Emily
was, and which was the only one the cabin contained.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Maxwell," said Emily, rising, "if you have any mercy, or pity
for my misfortunes, let
me be left alone."</p>
            <p>"I would not injure you, Miss Dumont," replied Maxwell, in a
gentle tone. "I would see you
in safety at your destination. Mr. Vernon has been two hours absent,
in search of a carriage."</p>
            <p>"A carriage! For what?"</p>
            <p>"To convey you to a steamboat-landing."</p>
            <p>"Bless your heart, sir! you needn't go a step for that. My Jerry
will hail the very next one that
passes the woodyard," suggested the old lady.</p>
            <p>"Silence, old woman!" said Maxwell, sternly, for he feared the
dame would increase Emily's
distrust of him.</p>
            <p>"Don't old-woman me, you puppy! I know what 's what!" responded
the dame, sharply, for
her temper was not exactly angelic; "it 's my opinion you don't mean
this lady any good. Let me
tell you, aforehand, you can't cut any of your didoes here!"</p>
            <p>"Silence, woman! when I need your help I will ask it. I propose,
Miss Dumont, to convey
you to Vicksburg, where you can be comfortably accommodated until a
steamer arrives which
will take you to Cincinnati. It may be several days, you are aware."</p>
            <p>"Several days!" exclaimed the mistress of the cabin; "who ever
heerd of such a thing!
There'll be one along afore the day is out."</p>
            <p>"For Cincinnati?" sneered Maxwell, who found the old woman's
tongue a very formidable
weapon.</p>
            <p>"I dare say there will," responded the dame.</p>
            <pb n="150"/>
            <p>"It is extremely uncertain, Miss Dumont. We came in the last one, and it is
scarcely possible at this season, another followed immediately. But
here is the carriage."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Maxwell, I shall positively refuse to accompany you," said
Emily, in a most decided
tone. "This good woman, I doubt not, will accommodate me."</p>
            <p>"That I will," promptly responded the dame.</p>
            <p>"I am sorry, Miss Dumont, I cannot, in this instance, yield to
your wishes. I must insist on
your company to Vicksburg," said Maxwell, striving, by a supercilious
manner, to keep down his
angry passions.</p>
            <p>"By what right, sir, do you <emph>insist</emph> upon it? I was not
aware that you were
invested with any legal control over me."</p>
            <p>"Then you are mistaken. I act upon undoubted authority."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, sir, are you my guardian?" said Emily, shuddering at the
thought of the will.</p>
            <p>"Not technically a guardian. My authority is a little more definite."</p>
            <p>"I do not understand you, sir."</p>
            <p>"It is immaterial. Perhaps you had better go with me peaceably,
however," said Maxwell,
with a carelessness foreign to his feelings.</p>
            <p>"That, sir, I never will do alive!" replied Emily, surmising the
nature of the attorney's
assumed authority. "Mr. Maxwell, you have taught me to believe that
you are a hardened villain,
and I <emph>command</emph> you, leave my presence!"</p>
            <p>The indignation of Emily was roused, and she spoke with a flashing
eye, and with an
imperativeness which her wrongs alone could have called to her aid.</p>
            <p>"That was very prettily done, lady; but I cannot obey. It is
useless to multiply words. You <emph>must</emph> go with me;" and
Maxwell extended his hand.</p>
            <p>Emily recoiled from the proffered hand; her brow lowered, and her
lips compressed. She
regarded him with a look of<pb n="151"/>
ineffable scorn,—a look before which even
Maxwell, penetrated, as he was, with evil purposes, quailed.</p>
            <p>"Go along, now, about your business, and don't bother the lady any
more!" said the old
woman, taking advantage of the momentary silence.</p>
            <p>"Miss Dumont, I once more ask you to go with me peaceably," said
Maxwell, not heeding
the dame's remark.</p>
            <p>"And once more I answer, <emph>I will not!</emph>"</p>
            <p>"I should be sorry to use compulsion. Do you forget your condition?"</p>
            <p>"I do not," replied Emily, with a tremor, but without the loss of
her self-possession. "I am of
the best blood of Louisiana."</p>
            <p>"But still a <emph>slave!</emph>"</p>
            <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed the hostess.</p>
            <p>"I am <emph>not</emph> a slave! You know this is the plot of a
villain like yourself. The
true will has been found."</p>
            <p>"Indeed! Is it here?" said Maxwell, with a sneer, for while he had
Emily in his power he
feared nothing.</p>
            <p>"No; but it shall be brought forth in due season."</p>
            <p>"Until which time you are a slave; and not only a slave, but
<emph>my</emph> slave,"
replied Maxwell, with perfect coolness, as he drew from his
pocket-book the forged bill of sale.</p>
            <p>"Great God, desert me not in this hour of my afflictions!" groaned
Emily. This last revelation
entirely unnerved her, and exposed in a more terrible light her
appalling position. She doubted
not the paper she saw in Maxwell's hands was a bill of sale of her
person, and that it would
establish his claim; for his present purposes seemed too flagrant to
be pursued without good
authority. Her features, dress and language, she felt, would be no
safeguards. She had seen
slave-girls as fair and white as herself. She had heard of those who,
with scarcely a drop of negro
blood in their veins, were educated to pander to the appetite of
depravity. She had seen them in
the streets of New Orleans, in no manner <orig>differ-</orig>
               <pb n="152"/>
ing in
appearance from the best-born ladies. Her situation, then, was an
awful one.</p>
            <p>"Will you read this paper?" continued Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"No; like the will, it is a forgery!" replied Emily, determined to
die rather than yield herself
to the guidance of the attorney.</p>
            <p>"It gives me an undeniable right to your person, and you must obey
me. The carriage waits in
the road."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Maxwell, if you have a particle of honor left, or if even a
shadow of pity rests in your
heart, leave me, and finish your despicable persecution!" said Emily,
in a pleading tone.</p>
            <p>"I have both honor and pity; but I cannot abandon my purpose. You
refused to trust to my
honor, refused to receive the offered hand, which would lead you back
to the home you have left.
I would fain have averted the calamity you are madly courting; but
you would not. I humbly
prayed to be allowed to step between you and your uncle's avarice;
but you would not. I would
willingly have prevented the accomplishment of your uncle's plans;
but—"</p>
            <p>"Then you own that it is a plot?"</p>
            <p>"I acknowledge nothing."</p>
            <p>"But you know it is a base trick?"</p>
            <p>"It is not for me to say. The law will be satisfied. I have
offered to do all I could for you, and
you have refused. You appeal to my pity. Pity! did you pity me when I
would have been your
willing slave,—when I pleaded for the hope you have ruthlessly
crushed?"</p>
            <p>"I did pity you; but I could not help you. I could not then, and I
cannot now, give my hand
where my heart is uninterested. I feared you then, as I despise you
now. Report said your
character was not entirely free from stain, and you are now striving
to demonstrate the truth of
the rumors," said Emily, whose contempt would not be concealed.</p>
            <p>"Report may have belied me," replied Maxwell, struggling with his
violent passions. "But we
are wasting time.<pb n="153"/>
Proceed with me to Vicksburg, and I pledge you my honor you shall
not be injured or insulted."</p>
            <p>"Your honor!" said Emily, bitterly. "It is but a poor dependence
for an unprotected female."</p>
            <p>"Gently, Miss Dumont! Do not rouse the demon within me by such taunts."</p>
            <p>"I fear the worst demon of your nature is already in the ascendency."</p>
            <p>"Enough! Will you go, or will you not?" said Maxwell, impatiently.</p>
            <p>"I will not!"</p>
            <p>"Then I must claim you as my slave,—do not start!—and
<emph>compel</emph> you."</p>
            <p>"Bond or free, I will not stir from beneath this roof with you,"
replied Emily, with calm
resolution. All hope, if she had cherished any, was gone. Silently
she breathed a prayer for
strength and meekness to endure all; for fortitude to enable her to
struggle till death with the
oppression of her enemy; and for courage to meet any emergency in
which her lot might be cast.</p>
            <p>"It must be done! I will hesitate no longer!" said Maxwell,
seizing Emily by the arm.</p>
            <p>"Look here, you varmint, that won't do here!" exclaimed the
mistress of the house, who,
much against her inclination, had remained silent during the past
fifteen minutes. "It shan't be
said that Jerry Swinger's ruff couldn't protect a stranger."</p>
            <p>"But, woman, she is my property," answered Maxwell, not a little
intimidated by the
ferocious aspect of the matron.</p>
            <p>"Do not believe him, good woman, do not believe him!" exclaimed
Emily, as she saw the
woman was a little staggered by the attorney's claim.</p>
            <p>"No, ma'am, I won't believe him," responded Mrs. Swinger, as her
heart triumphed over the
argument of the lawyer.</p>
            <p>"It matters little whether you believe me or not. Here is<pb n="154"/>
the bill of sale, and, in
the name of the law, I take what is mine."</p>
            <p>The hostess was not a little perplexed by the document, and Emily
observed, with terror, that
she wavered in her purpose.</p>
            <p>"It is a gross forgery!" exclaimed Emily, with a glance of earnest
pleading, which the rough
but kind-hearted woman could not resist.</p>
            <p>"I don't care nothin' about your bill of sale! The gal is safe,"
said Mrs. Swinger, with
emphasis.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, resolving to execute his design, again seized Emily by
the arm, and was on the
point of hurrying her out of the cabin.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Swinger was a stout, masculine woman, brought up in the
woods, and never fainted in
her life, even in presence of an alligator or a panther. So she had
no scruples in seizing Mr.
Maxwell by the nape of the neck, and giving him a kind of double
twist, which sent him reeling
into the corner of the cabin.</p>
            <p>"I'll teach you to put your hands upon an onprotected female, you
varmint, you!" said she,
and, going to the door, she screamed "Jerry" three times, with a
voice that would have done
honor to a Stentor.</p>
            <p>"Now, stranger," said she, elevating her tall form to its full
height, and, with a gesture like a
queen of the Amazons, pointing to the door, "take yourself off, or my
Jerry will tote you down to
the river, and drown you like a kitten!"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Swinger's arm fell like a tragic heroine's, and she stood
proudly contemplating the
object of her wrath, perhaps hoping the attorney would await the
arrival of "her Jerry," in whose
prowess she seemed to place unlimited confidence.</p>
            <p>Vernon, who was waiting near the vehicle he had procured, heard
the loud and angry words
of the excited dame, and now approached the house to ascertain the
cause of the confusion. This
redoubtable worthy had received the reward of his villany, and
considered the deed
accomplished; but he<pb n="155"/>
had no objection to a little excitement. A fight was his element,
and he never let slip an opportunity to join in one.</p>
            <p>The worthy Jerry Swinger, the good woman's beau ideal of a man,
reached the cabin at the
moment Vernon entered.</p>
            <p>Maxwell had now the alternative of abandoning his coveted prize,
or of fighting for it. The
first he would not do; and the second, with the wound he had received
in the duel, was not an
easy matter. The latter, however, he determined upon. Drawing from
his pocket a revolver, he
again approached Emily.</p>
            <p>"What 's all this about?" said Jerry, as he entered the cabin.</p>
            <p>"Save me, sir,—save me from these villains!" exclaimed
Emily, whose piteous accents
penetrated the heart of the honest woodman.</p>
            <p>"That I will, ma'am. Why, you infarnal, sneakin' whelp of an
alligator, whar 's your
conscience? But you've run agin a snag, and you shan't make another
bend, this trip; so sheer off!
Suke, jest fotch out my rifle, thar."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Swinger, before the assailants could prevent it, unhung the
rifle, and was about to
present it to her husband, when Maxwell pointed his pistol at her,
and said, "Move another inch,
woman, and I will fire!"</p>
            <p>"Look here, stranger," said Jerry, approaching the attorney, "if
you touch that trigger, I 'll
pull your heart out!"</p>
            <p>Vernon saw that his time had come, and, grappling with the
woodman, they both fell upon
the mud floor of the cabin.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, his pistol still pointed at the woman, advanced a step,
with the intention of taking
the rifle from her. Mrs. Swinger, perceiving his purpose, elevated
the rifle to her shoulder as
gracefully as the most accomplished Kentuckian would have done, and
fired. But her aim was
bad; the ball passed through the attorney's hat. It came near enough,
however, to rouse his
passion, and, without a moment's deliberation, which might have saved
him the reproach of
shooting<pb n="156"/>
a woman, he fired. His aim, better than his feminine opponent's had been,
sent the ball through her side, and she fell. Emily, filled with
horror by the sanguinary scene,
sprung to Mrs. Swinger's aid, as she fell.</p>
            <p>"Look here, you cussed villain," said Jerry Swinger, who, in the
struggle, had got his
antagonist under him, and had drawn from his pocket a long
clasp-knife, "if you stir an inch, I 'll
put this blood-sucker through your shrivelled-up gizzard!"</p>
            <p>Vernon attempted to rise, bowie-knife in hand, to the conflict.
Jerry Swinger was about to
put his threat in execution, when Maxwell, released, by the fall of
the woman, from danger in
that quarter, struck him a heavy blow upon the head with the pistol
in his hand. The woodman
sunk back, with a groan, and Vernon, rising from his fallen posture,
was about to plunge the
knife to his heart, when a new actor appeared upon the stage. The
blade of Vernon was arrested
in its deadly descent, and a single blow from the fist of the
new-comer laid the black-leg
prostrate by the side of the woodman. Maxwell was thrown off his
guard by the suddenness of
the new assailant's movements, and, before he could raise his
pistol,—his only
dependence,—it was wrested from him. The new-comer threw the
pistol down, and,
seizing the attorney by the neck, and applying a smart blow with the
knee upon his back, he
brought him to the floor. Taking a cord which hung on the cabin wall,
he bound the fallen man
hand and foot, and dragged him out of the cabin. Placing his back
against a tree, he lashed him
firmly to its trunk. Leaving the chop-fallen attorney to mature his
plans, the conqueror returned
to the hut.</p>
            <p>"O, Hatchie, Hatchie! you have again saved me!" exclaimed Emily,
as she saw her deliverer
reënter. "Thank God! I am safe, though at what a terrible sacrifice!"</p>
            <p>She had, in her terror, obtained but a very imperfect idea of the
exciting scene which had
transpired before her. When she saw Vernon fall, and then Maxwell,
she realized that she was<pb n="157"/>
safe. With an effort,—for her excited nerves had taken away her
strength,—she rose from her position on the floor, by the side
of her lifeless hostess. At
this moment Hatchie entered, and, with a heart full of gratitude, she
grasped his hand.</p>
            <p>"O Hatchie! what do I not owe you for this service!"</p>
            <p>"I am so happy to serve you, Miss Emily!" replied Hatchie,
rejoiced to hear again his
mistress' voice.</p>
            <p>"You have been my best friend in this season of adversity. Without
you, I had been lost
forever. But let us do what we may for these poor people, who have, I
fear, sacrificed their lives
in my defence."</p>
            <p>The inanimate form of Mrs. Swinger was placed upon the bed by
Hatchie, and, while Emily
endeavored to ascertain the nature of her wound, the mulatto examined
into Jerry's condition.
The worthy woodman had only been stunned by the blow, and Hatchie's
vigorous application
soon restored him to consciousness. With the assistance of the
mulatto, he rose. Looking wildly
around him, he discovered the form of Vernon upon the floor. This
seemed to recall his
recollection of the events of the hour.</p>
            <p>"Whar 's Suke?" said he.</p>
            <p>Then perceiving her outstretched form upon the bed, he calmly, but
very sorrowfully, asked,
"Is she dead?"</p>
            <p>"No, thank God! she is not dead; but I fear she is badly injured,"
replied Emily, who was still
bending over the sufferer.</p>
            <p>The woodman approached the bed-side, and, oberving the faint
breathing which gently heaved her chest, he seemed comforted.</p>
            <p>"Whar 's the wound?" asked he, in a melancholy tone.</p>
            <p>"In her side," replied Emily; "the bullet seems to have penetrated
the region below the heart."</p>
            <p>"Poor gal! I'm feered it's all up with her. She has been a good
woman to me."</p>
            <p>"I am afraid my visit to your house will prove a sad day to you,
even if she recovers," said
Emily, in a sad tone.</p>
            <pb n="158"/>
            <p>"No, stranger, no! Suke would have died any day to save a neighbor from
misery;" and the woodman's eyes filled with tears at the remembrance
of his humble companion's
virtues.</p>
            <p>"But let us hope for the best. Is there a physician in the vicinity?"</p>
            <p>"Ay, stranger, there is one that sometimes helps the poor folks
about here."</p>
            <p>"Then, Hatchie, you can go for him."</p>
            <p>"Stop a little! The doctor is an oncommon strange man, and lives
on an island down the
bend."</p>
            <p>"I will go for him," said Hatchie.</p>
            <p>"I dar say; but whar you gwine? that's the pint. Nobody can find
the way that warn't there
before. My son, Jim, will soon be here."</p>
            <p>"But we must be as speedy as possible," suggested Emily.</p>
            <p>The arrival of the woodman's son terminated the difficulty. It was
arranged that Hatchie
should go with him, to assist in rowing back.</p>
            <p>As they were about to depart, Vernon showed signs of returning
life, and Hatchie conveyed
him to an out-building till a more convenient season, and then
dismissed the negro and his
vehicle, which had been brought to convey Emily to Vicksburg.</p>

            <p>WE left the Chalmetta in a situation which
demands explanation.</p>
            <p>Emily retired to her state-room on that dreadful night entirely
relieved from the distressing
anticipations which had before oppressed her. Her name and her home
were virtually restored to
her. The foul stain upon the honor of her father had been removed.
Doubt and fear scarcely
disturbed her; the battle yet to be fought seemed but a trifle.
Maxwell had said her uncle was left
at a wood-yard. This was strange. It looked not like an accident, but
the doing of the wily
attorney; and perhaps Jaspar had voluntarily withdrawn; perhaps her
uncle had made <emph>her</emph> the reward of Maxwell's silence. But
these reflections were now robbed of their
bitterness. She felt that in Henry Carroll she had a sufficient protection.</p>
            <p>She retired to her state-room with a light heart, and even
Maxwell's villanous designs were
forgotten as she revelled in the bright hopes before her. She knew
nothing of the foul plot which
had been concocted for her abduction. She knew not that Henry Carroll
was then watching over
her. In blissful ignorance of the danger that hovered near her, she
sunk into the quiet sleep of
innocence.</p>
            <p>After midnight her slumbers were disturbed by the unusual creaking
of the boat, and the
hasty puffs of steam from the<pb n="160"/>
escape-pipes. She awoke, and was at once sensible of
the immense pressure to which the boilers were subjected. Awhile she
lay and listened to the
ominous sounds which indicated the danger of the boat; then, much
alarmed, she rose and
dressed herself. For nearly an hour she sat in the darkness of the
room, during which time the
danger seemed momentarily to increase, until, no longer able to
endure such agonizing suspense,
she was about to leave the room. At this moment Vernon was about to
enter, when the explosion
took place.</p>
            <p>The forward part of the Chalmetta was completely torn in pieces.
The gentlemen's cabin was
lifted from its supports, and torn into fragments. The unfortunate
occupants of berths in this part
of the boat were either instantly killed or severely wounded. The
ladies' cabin, being at a greater
distance from the immediate scene of the explosion, had not suffered
so severely. Although torn
from its position, and shattered by the shock, it had proved fatal to
but a few of its occupants,
who had been crushed by falling timbers. The hull of the boat was not
injured by the explosion,
but before those who had escaped a sudden death could recover their
disordered faculties, the
flames began to ascend from the wreck of the cabin, which had been
precipitated upon the
furnaces.</p>
            <p>The scene surpassed description. The groans of the wounded and
scalded, the shrieks of
those who were on the boat, expecting every moment to be carried down
in her, mingled in wild
confusion on the midnight air. Fortunately the passengers were mostly
soldiers, accustomed to
scenes of horror, who immediately turned their attention to the
extinguishing of the flames. The
Flatfoot, No. 3, approached within a short distance of the wreck, and
a line was passed from her
to the bow of the Chalmetta. Her passengers and crew were humanely
assisting in rescuing those
who had jumped or been thrown overboard in the disaster.</p>
            <p>By the aid of a fire-engine on board of the Flatfoot, which<pb n="161"/>
had approached near
enough to render it available, the flames were extinguished. It was
ascertained that the Chalmetta
had received no serious damage in her hull; and as all the survivors
had been picked up, the
Flatfoot took her in tow, and proceeded up the river.</p>
            <p>Emily had been stunned by the explosion, and ere she could
recover, Vernon, with a strong
arm, bore her to the main deck. The boat was lowered into the water,
and, before the passengers,
or the petrified watch in the hold, could regain their
self-possession, it was impelled by the
strong arm of Vernon, and the ruffian who had been hired for the
purpose, far astern of the
wreck.</p>
            <p>The main deck was enveloped in clouds of steam, so that, when
Vernon had handed Emily
down, the movement could not be seen by Hatchie and his friends in
the hold. In another instant
the wreck of the cabins came tumbling down.</p>
            <p>Hatchie, understanding at once the nature of the calamity, made
his way, as well as he was
able, through the shattered ruins to the stern, where he discovered
that the boat was gone. The
flames from the forward part of the boat now enabled him to discover
the abductors of Emily
rowing down the river. Leaping into the water, he seized a door,
which was floating near him,
and thus enabled to sustain himself with tolerable ease, he swam
after them.</p>
            <p>Emily, on recovering from the shock, found herself reclining on
the shoulder of a man in an
open boat. The first impulse of her pious heart was to return thanks
to the Almighty preserver
that she had been rescued from a terrible death. Her thoughts then
turned to her deliverer, for
such she supposed was the person in the boat with her. Who was he?
Was it Henry Carroll? She
hoped it was. She raised her head from the position in which Maxwell
had placed it, and
endeavored to distinguish his features; but the darkness defeated her wish.</p>
            <p>"Fear nothing, lady; you are safe," said Maxwell.</p>
            <pb n="162"/>
            <p>The voice was like the knell of doom. It grated harshly upon her
ears, and gave
rise to a thousand fears in her timid heart.</p>
            <p>"Thank God, I am safe!" said she, after a pause.</p>
            <p>"And I thank God I have been the means of preserving you," replied
Maxwell, willing to
render the terrible calamity an accessory to his crime.</p>
            <p>"But why do you go this way?" asked Emily, as she saw the Flatfoot
approach the wreck.</p>
            <p>"I only wish to convey you from the scene of danger."</p>
            <p>"Then why not go to that steamer?"</p>
            <p>"Probably she is by this time converted into a hospital for the
sufferers. I would not shock
your delicate nerves with such a scene of woe and misery as will be
on board of her."</p>
            <p>"May we not render some assistance?"</p>
            <p>"No doubt there are more assistants than can labor to advantage now."</p>
            <p>Emily was silent, but not satisfied. Her fears in some measure
subsided, when, about two
miles below the scene of the disaster, Maxwell ordered the boat to be
put in at a wood-yard. The
attorney was all gentleness, and assisted her to the cabin of Jerry
Swinger, the owner of the
wood-yard.</p>
            <p>Hatchie had been able, by severe exertion, to keep within hearing
of the splashing oars. The
current fortunately carried him near the wood-yard, and, aided by the
sounds he heard at the
cabin, and by the boat which he saw, he concluded the party had
landed there. Letting go the
door, a few vigorous strokes brought him to the shore. Approaching
the cabin, he satisfied
himself that his mistress had taken shelter there. Concealing himself
in the woods, he awaited
with much anxiety the next movement of the attorney. In the morning
he heard the noise at the
cabin, and had been the means of saving his mistress from a calamity
far more dreadful than
death itself.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <pb n="163"/>
            <p>On the evening of the day of the explosion, an elderly gentleman
sat in a private
apartment of one of the principal hotels in Vicksburg, attentively
reading an "Extra," in which
the particulars of the disaster were detailed. He read, with little
apparent interest, the account,
until he came to the names of "Saved, Killed, Wounded and Missing."
An expression of the
deepest anxiety settled upon his countenance. He finished reading the
list of survivors, and a
transient feeling of satisfaction was visible on his face. When in
the list of the "missing" he read
the name of "Miss Dumont, Antoine De Guy and Henry Carroll," a smile
as of glutted revenge
and malignant hatred dispelled the cloud of anxiety which had before
brooded over his features.
Throwing down the sheet, he drank off a glass of brandy, which had
been waiting his pleasure on
the table. The potion was not insignificant in quantity or strength,
and the wry face he made did
not add to the amiability of his expression. As the dose permeated
his brain, and produced that
agreeable lightness which is the first phase of intoxication, he
rubbed his hands with childish
delight, and half muttered an expression of pleasure.</p>
            <p>Suddenly his countenance assumed its former lowering aspect, his
brows knit, and his lips
compressed.</p>
            <p>"Missing!" muttered he. "What the devil does <emph>missing</emph>
mean? What can it
mean but dead, defunct, gone to a better world, as the canting
hypocrites say?"</p>
            <p>But we will not attempt to record the muttered soliloquy of the
gentleman,—Jaspar
Dumont, who had reached Vicksburg that day, from the wood-yard where
we left him. It was too
profane, too sacrilegious, to stain our page.</p>
            <p>Grasping the bell-rope with a sudden energy, as though a new
thought had struck him, he
gave it a violent pull, which brought to his presence a black waiter.</p>
            <p>"Has the Dragon returned?" asked Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Yes, sar, jus got in, Massa."</p>
            <p>"Is there any person in the house who went up in her?"</p>
            <pb n="164"/>
            <p>"Yes, massa, one gemman in de office."</p>
            <p>"Who is he?"</p>
            <p>"Massa—massa—" and the darkey scratched his head, to
stimulate his memory,
which act instantly brought the name to his mind. "Massa
<emph>Lousey</emph>."</p>
            <p>"Mister what, you black scoundrel!"</p>
            <p>"Yes, sar,—Massa Lousey; dat's de name."</p>
            <p>"Lousey?" repeated Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Stop bit," said the waiter, a new idea penetrating his cranium.
"Dar Lousey, dat's de name,
for sartin."</p>
            <p>"Dalhousie," responded Jaspar. "Give my compliments to Mr.
Dalhousie, and ask him to
oblige me with a few moments' conversation in this room."</p>
            <p>"Yes, sar;" and the waiter retired, muttering, "Dar Lousey."</p>
            <p>The Dragon was a small steamer, which had been sent, on the
intelligence of a "blow up," to
obtain the particulars for the press, and render assistance to the
survivors. Dalhousie was a
transient visitor at the hotel, and, with many others, had gone in
the Dragon to gratify his
curiosity.</p>
            <p>"Sorry to trouble you, sir," said Jaspar, as the gentleman entered
the apartment; "but I am
much interested in the fate of several persons who were passengers on
board the Chalmetta."</p>
            <p>"No trouble, Mr. Dumont, I am extremely happy to serve you,"
replied Dalhousie, whose
obsequious manners were ample evidence of his sincerity.</p>
            <p>"My niece was on board of her," continued Jaspar, "and I see her
name in the list of missing."</p>
            <p>"Your <emph>niece!</emph>" replied Dalhousie, emphasizing the
latter word. He had a few
days before come from New Orleans, and had there heard of the
startling developments in the
Dumont family.</p>
            <p>"No matter," returned Jaspar, sharply; "she went by the name of
Dumont. Did you find any
bodies?"</p>
            <pb n="165"/>
            <p>"We picked up the remains of six men and two females."</p>
            <p>"Can you describe the females? How were they dressed?" asked
Jaspar, in an excited manner.</p>
            <p>"One was dressed in black. The other had on a common calico."</p>
            <p>"But the one in black,—describe her,—her
hair,—was she tall or short?"
interrupted Jaspar, hurriedly.</p>
            <p>"Her hair was in curls. She was apparently about twenty-six or
seven, and rather short in
stature."</p>
            <p>"Curls," muttered Jaspar; "she has not worn curls since the
colonel died. She may have put
them on again to please that infernal Captain Carroll. Twenty-six
years old, you think?"</p>
            <p>"She may have been younger. Her features were terribly mangled,"
and Mr. Dalhousie cast a
penetrating glance at Jaspar, as though he would read out the
beatings of his black heart.</p>
            <p>Jaspar considered again the description, and, though it did not
correspond to his niece's, his
anxiety had contributed to warp his judgment. He was very willing to
believe the Chalmetta's
fatal disaster had forever removed the only obstacle to the
gratification of his ambition, and the
only source of future insecurity. He paced the room, muttering, in
his abstraction, sundry broken
phrases.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie watched him, and endeavored to obtain the purport of his
disjointed soliloquy. A
stranger, without some strong motive, could scarcely have had so much
interest in him as he
appeared to have.</p>
            <p>"Had she any jewels—ornaments of any kind?" asked Dalhousie,
after the silence had
grown disagreeable to him.</p>
            <p>"She had," replied Jaspar, stopping suddenly in his perambulation
of the room, and speaking
with an eagerness which betrayed his anxiety to obtain more evidence.
"Were any found upon
her person?"</p>
            <p>"You are a man of honor, Mr. Dumont, and, if I disclose to you a
thoughtless indiscretion of
my own, you will not, of<pb n="166"/>
course, expose me?" said Dalhousie, with hesitation, and
apparent want of confidence.</p>
            <p>"Of course not," replied Jaspar, impatiently. "What has this to do
with the matter?"</p>
            <p>"Did your niece wear a ring?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, a mourning ring."</p>
            <p>"Do you know the ring? Could you identify it?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly," replied Jaspar, who remembered having seen an
ornament of this description on
the finger of Emily.</p>
            <p>"Will you describe it to me, if you please?"</p>
            <p>But Jaspar had reckoned without his host. The details of a piece
of jewelry were matters
entirely foreign to his taste. However, he succeeded in giving a
description, which, from its
general terms, might have applied to one mourning ring as well as another.</p>
            <p>"Is this the one?" asked Dalhousie, with an anxiety which he could
scarcely conceal, as he
produced a ring.</p>
            <p>"That <emph>is</emph> it," replied Jaspar, confidently; and the
jewel did bear some
resemblance to that worn by Emily.</p>
            <p>"But where did you obtain this?"</p>
            <p>"I must insist on the most inviolable secrecy."</p>
            <p>"Certainly, certainly," said Jaspar, eagerly.</p>
            <p>"I will disclose the particulars only on the condition that you
pledge yourself never to reveal
my agency in the matter; for it would compromise my character."</p>
            <p>"Very well. I pledge you my honor," replied Jaspar, impatiently.
"You took it from the
corpse of the lady in black."</p>
            <p>"I did, and you must be aware that such an act would subject me to
inconvenience, if
known."</p>
            <p>"Don't be alarmed; your secret is safe."</p>
            <p>"But are you sure this is the ring worn by your niece?"</p>
            <p>"It looks like it;" but Jaspar was perplexed with a doubt. He
bethought himself that it was
only in a casual glance he had observed Emily's ring. He had never
examined it, and, after all,
this might not be the one. There was certainly<pb n="167"/>
nothing strange in any lady dressed in
black wearing a mourning ring. Again he turned the ring over and
over, and scrutinized it
closely. His finger touched a spring, and the plate flew up,
disclosing a small lock of gray hair,
twined around the single letter D.</p>
            <p>"I will swear to it now," exclaimed Jaspar, in a tone which
betrayed the malicious joy he felt
at the discovery. He was perfectly satisfied now of the identity of
the ring. It never occurred to
him that D stood for any other name than Dumont.</p>
            <p>"This appears to be decisive evidence," replied Dalhousie. "Your
<emph>niece</emph>,
then, must be the person brought down by the Dragon."</p>
            <p>"Without doubt."</p>
            <p>"As this matter, then, is settled to your satisfaction—"</p>
            <p>"Sir!" exclaimed Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"I beg your pardon," resumed Dalhousie, with a supercilious air;
"I only meant that your
mind was satisfied—relieved from a painful anxiety."</p>
            <p>"A very painful anxiety," replied Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"I understand, sir, you own a large plantation."</p>
            <p>"Well."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you need an overseer?"</p>
            <p>Jaspar acknowledged that he did need an overseer.</p>
            <p>"I should be happy to make an engagement with you," said the
other, in complaisant tones.</p>
            <p>"I don't think you would suit me. You are too genteel, by half."
returned Jaspar, bluntly.</p>
            <p>"I have been in a better position, it is true. I was born in
France, but I understand the
business."</p>
            <p>"Did you ever manage a gang of niggers?"</p>
            <p>After a little hesitation, Dalhousie replied that he had.</p>
            <p>"We will talk of it some other time," said Jaspar, satisfied, from
the air and manner of the
other, that his statement was false.</p>
            <pb n="168"/>
            <p>Dalhousie put on his hat, and, taking the mourning ring from the
table, was about
to enfold it in a bit of paper.</p>
            <p>"What are you about, sir?" exclaimed Jaspar, as he witnessed the act.</p>
            <p>"The ring is my property, is it not?" said Dalhousie.</p>
            <p>"Put it down, or, by heavens, I will expose your rascality in
taking it!"</p>
            <p>"Do not be hasty, sir. I have not studied your looks, the last
hour, without profiting by them."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean by that?" said Jaspar, a little startled.</p>
            <p>"I mean that the death of your niece does not seem to be received
with that degree of sorrow
which an uncle would naturally feel."</p>
            <p>"Fool! she was not my niece!"</p>
            <p>"Why are you so anxious to establish her decease?"</p>
            <p>"Was I anxious?" said Jaspar, not knowing how far he might have
betrayed himself.</p>
            <p>"Quite enough so to convince even the most indifferent observer
that you were extremely
rejoiced at the event," replied Dalhousie, willing to make out a
strong case.</p>
            <p>Jaspar did not reply, and it was plain Dalhousie's remarks had had
their effect.</p>
            <p>"But, Mr. Dumont, I flatter myself I am a man of discretion. As
you were saying, you need
an overseer," said Dalhousie, with a glance at Jaspar, which conveyed
more meaning than his
words.</p>
            <p>The glance was irresistible, and Jaspar engaged him at a liberal
salary, as well as his wife,
who was to be the housekeeper at Bellevue. Dalhousie was a needy man.
His fortunes were on
the descending scale. Born in France, he had emigrated to this
country, with the chimerical hope
of speedily making a fortune. He could not build up the coveted
temple stone by stone, but
wished it to rise like a fairy castle. With such views, he had
wandered about the country with his
wife (whom he had married since his arrival), in search<pb n="169"/>
of the philosopher's stone. He
had several times engaged in subordinate capacities, but his
impatient hopes would not brook the
distance between him and the goal. He had been to New Orleans, but
the city was almost
deserted. On his arrival at Vicksburg, Jaspar had been pointed out to
him as a person who could
probably favor his wishes, and he had obtained an introduction to him.</p>
            <p>Jaspar's thoughts and feelings he read. He discovered the nature
of the relations between the
uncle and niece,—which required but little sagacity, under the
circumstances. Determined
to profit by the knowledge he had obtained, his first step was to
satisfy Jaspar of the death of
Emily, of whom, in reality, he knew nothing. The initial letter of
his wife's name in the ring had
suggested the means, and he had convinced Jaspar as related. How
Dalhousie's sense of moral
rectitude would allow him to use the deception, we will not say; but
he seemed to tolerate the
idea that the great purpose he had in view would justify any little
peccadilloes he might commit
in obtaining it.</p>
            <p>He had gained his end, and taken the first step in the great road
to fortune; and he doubted
not his future relations with Jaspar would suggest a second.</p>
            <p>The body of the deceased lady was claimed by Dalhousie, in behalf
of Jaspar, and interred in
Vicksburg.</p>
            <p>In company with the new overseer and his wife, Jaspar returned the
next day to Bellevue.</p>

            <p>THE morning advanced, and Henry
Carroll, under the influence of the powerful opiate, still slept. By
his side sat the misanthropic
physician, who seemed to have learned a lesson of the dealing of the
Creator with the creature
such as he had never before acquired. He had rescued a
fellow-creature from sure death, and the
act seemed a part of the great duties of life which he had so long
neglected. He reflected upon the
numerous opportunities of doing good to his fellow-men from which his
hermit-life debarred
him. Again he thought of his daughter. Her image rose before him in
the darkened chamber of
the sick man, and seemed to reproach him for his want of faithfulness
to her. The incident and
reflections of the previous night had strangely influenced his mind,
and changed the whole
current of his impulses and hopes. The solitude of his lonely island
no longer seemed desirable.
The world, with all its vanities and vexations, was the true sphere
of life.</p>
            <p>The arrival of Jim now summoned him to the relief of Mrs. Swinger.
Calling in the old
negro, he gave him some directions in case the patient should awake,
and, taking his case of
surgical instruments, he proceeded to the landing. Unmooring the
sail-boat, he took the two
messengers on board,<pb n="171"/>
with their boat in tow. The wind was still fresh, and the yacht,
with all her sails spread, bore the doctor rapidly on his errand of
mercy. A strange impulse
seemed to animate him,—an impulse of genuine, heart-felt
sympathy towards the whole
human family,—a feeling to which he had before been a stranger.
His profession seemed
to him now a boon of mercy to the suffering, and he saw how poorly he
had performed his
mission to the world. He felt a pleasure he had never before
experienced, in being able to relieve
the distressed, to heal the wounded heart, as well as the bruised limb.</p>
            <p>Under the skilful pilotage of Dr. Vaudelier the more rapid
currents were avoided, the boat
pressed to her utmost speed; and in a short time the party landed at
the wood-yard of Jerry
Swinger.</p>
            <p>During the absence of the messengers Emily, by the most assiduous
attentions, had
succeeded in restoring the wounded woman to a state of partial
consciousness. The arrival of the
doctor increased her hopes of a speedy restoration. The rough
woodman, who had patiently
watched Emily as she labored over his beloved partner, was melted
into tears of joy when he
heard her faintly articulate his name.</p>
            <p>After a thorough examination of the wound, the doctor announced
the gratifying intelligence
that the woman was not dangerously wounded. The severe operation of
extracting the ball was
performed, and the patient left to the quiet her situation demanded.</p>
            <p>On the passage from Cottage Island Hatchie had related the
particulars of the affray, so that
on his arrival Dr. Vaudelier was in possession of all the facts.</p>
            <p>"You have had a severe fight here, madam," said he to Emily, who
had followed him out to
inquire more particularly into the situation of her hostess.</p>
            <p>"We have, indeed; but I trust no lives will be lost," replied Emily.</p>
            <p>"No; the woman will do very well. The wound is a<pb n="172"/>
severe one, but not
dangerous. Her strong constitution will resist all fatal consequences."</p>
            <p>"I trust it may, for this has been a day of disaster, without the
loss of more life."</p>
            <p>"You were a passenger in the Chalmetta?"</p>
            <p>"I was."</p>
            <p>"Then you have had a narrow escape."</p>
            <p>"But a more narrow one since the explosion. Thank Heaven, I have
been preserved from both
calamities!"</p>
            <p>"Had you no friends on board?"</p>
            <p>"I had—one friend;" and she hesitated. "I fear he has perished."</p>
            <p>"Hope for the best!" replied the doctor, kindly.</p>
            <p>The blush, and then the change to the paleness of death, as Emily
thought of Henry, first as
the lover, and then as a mangled corse, had not escaped the notice of
Dr. Vaudelier. He read in
her varying color the relation they had sustained to each other.</p>
            <p>"I have no alternative but hope," said Emily; "but it seems like
hoping against the certainty
of evil."</p>
            <p>"I saved the life of a gentleman this morning who must shortly
have perished without aid.
He, too, had lost a dear friend."</p>
            <p>"Indeed!" said Emily, with interest.</p>
            <p>"Yes; but he was much injured, and will require the most diligent care."</p>
            <p>"I trust your merciful endeavors will be crowned with success. Do
you know the
gentleman?"</p>
            <p>"I do not. He has not yet been able to converse much. He was
dressed in the uniform of an
officer."</p>
            <p>"An officer! Perhaps it is he!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier was much interested in the adventure, and the pale,
anxious features of Emily
excited his sympathy for her.</p>
            <p>"As I dressed his wounds," said he, "I noticed the initials upon
his linen. Perhaps these may
afford some clue."</p>
            <pb n="173"/>
            <p>"What were they?" exclaimed Emily, scarcely able to articulate, in
the intensity of
her feelings.</p>
            <p>"H. C."</p>
            <p>"It is he! It is he! And you say he is wounded?"</p>
            <p>"I am sorry to say he is."</p>
            <p>"Can I go to him?" said Emily, grasping the doctor's arm.</p>
            <p>"I fear your presence will excite him. Are you a relative?"</p>
            <p>"No, not a relative," replied Emily, blushing; "but I know he
would like to see me."</p>
            <p>"I do not doubt it," said the doctor, with a smile,—a luxury
in which he rarely
indulged. "I am afraid your presence will agitate him."</p>
            <p>"Let me watch over him while he sleeps. He need not know I am near."</p>
            <p>"Rather difficult to manage, but you shall see him. Will you
return with me?"</p>
            <p>"Thank you, I will. But poor Mrs. Swinger!" and a shade of anxiety
crossed her features, as
she thought of leaving her kind hostess in affliction.</p>
            <p>"Her husband is a good nurse, and understands her case better than
you do. If I mistake not,
your services will be full as acceptable at my cottage."</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier tried to smile at this sally; but the effort was too
much for him, and he sank
under it.</p>
            <p>Emily, though sorry to leave her protectress, was drawn by the
irresistible magnetism of
affection to Cottage Island. She compromised between the opposing
demands of duty by
promising herself that she would again visit the wood-yard.</p>
            <p>She embarked with Dr. Vaudelier, and they were soon gliding down
the mighty river on their
way to Cottage Island. Emily had wished Hatchie to accompany her, as
much for his safety as for
her own; but the faithful fellow desired to stay at the wood-yard.
They had before had an
interview in relation to the will. Uncle Nathan, who had been made the<pb n="174"/>
custodian of
it, had not been seen or heard from, and her case again seemed to be
desperate. Hatchie assured
her of his safety, and of his good faith. He had left him in the
hold, and, with common prudence,
the worthy farmer might have made his escape unharmed. Emily, who now
regarded her devoted
servant in the light of a guardian angel, had entire confidence in
his reasoning and conclusions.
Of Hatchie's motive in remaining at the wood-yard she had no
conception. If she had had, she
would probably have insisted on his attendance.</p>
            <p>After the departure of Dr. Vaudelier and Emily, Hatchie went to
the cabin, and took
therefrom a carpet-bag belonging to Maxwell,—an article which,
even in the hurry of his
exit from the steamer, he had not omitted to take. With this in his
hand, he proceeded to the
out-building, to satisfy himself of the security of his prisoners;
but Vernon had fled,—the
wooden door of the shed had not been proof against his art. Hatchie
was not disconcerted by this
incident. Vernon, he was aware, was only a subordinate, who did his
evil deeds for hire, and
against him he bore no ill will. But it immediately occurred to him
that the ruffian might have
liberated Maxwell, and this would have utterly deranged his present
plans. Taking from the shed
a long rope, he proceeded to the other side of the cabin, where he
had secured the attorney to the
tree. To his great satisfaction he found the prisoner secure. Vernon
did not see him, or was too
intent on his own safety to bestow a thought upon his late employer.</p>
            <p>Hatchie reached the scene of Maxwell's humiliation. Coolly seating
himself on a log near the
discomfited lawyer, and regarding him with a look of contempt, he
proceeded to examine the
fastenings of the carpet-bag. Maxwell spoke not; his pride was still
"above par," and he returned
Hatchie's contemptuous glances with a scowl of scorn and hatred. The
attorney was in sore
tribulation at the unexpected turn affairs had taken, and the future
did not present<pb n="175"/>
a very encouraging aspect. Of the mulatto's present intentions he could
gain no idea. The long rope
he had brought with him looked ominous, and a shudder passed through
his frame as he
considered the uses to which it might be applied. As he regarded the
cool proceedings of his
jailer, the worst anticipations crowded upon him. The mulatto looked
like a demon of the
inquisition to his guilty soul. But, tortured as he was by the most
terrible forebodings, he still
preserved his dignified scowl, and watched the operations of Hatchie
with apparent coolness.</p>
            <p>Hatchie examined the lock upon the carpet-bag, and found that it
entirely secured the
contents from observation.</p>
            <p>"I will trouble you for the key of this bag," said he, politely,
as he rose and approached the
attorney.</p>
            <p>"What mean you, fellow? Would you rob me?" exclaimed Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"Not at all, sir; do not alarm yourself. The key, if you please.
In which pocket is it?"</p>
            <p>Hatchie approached, with the intention of searching his prisoner.</p>
            <p>"Stand off, villain!" cried Maxwell, as he gave the mulatto a
hearty kick in the neighborhood
of the knee.</p>
            <p>"Very well, sir," said Hatchie, not at all disconcerted by the blow.</p>
            <p>Taking the rope he had brought, he dexterously passed it round the
legs of the attorney, and
made it fast to the tree.</p>
            <p>"Now, sir, if you will tell which pocket contains the key, you
will save yourself the indignity
of being searched."</p>
            <p>"Miserable villain! if you wish to commit violence upon me, you
must do it without my
consent."</p>
            <p>"Sorry to disoblige you, sir," said Hatchie, with an affectation
of civility; "but I must have
the key."</p>
            <p>"I have not the key; it is lost. If I had, you should struggle for it."</p>
            <pb n="176"/>
            <p>"You will pardon me for doubting your word. I must satisfy myself."</p>
            <p>"Help! help!" shouted the attorney, as his tormentor proceeded to
put his threat in execution.</p>
            <p>This was a contingency for which Hatchie was not prepared. To the
little operation he was
about to perform he desired no witnesses at present, and a slight
rustling in the bushes near him
not a little disconcerted him. Stuffing a handkerchief into the
attorney's mouth, he waited for the
intruder upon his pastime; but no one came, and he proceeded to
search the pockets of the
lawyer. To his great disappointment, the key could not be found.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was persuaded that this carpet-bag must contain some
evidence which would be of
service to his mistress, in case Uncle Nathan and the will should not
come to light. There were
two acts to the drama he intended to perform on the present occasion;
the first, alone with the
attorney,—and the last, in the presence of witnesses.
Deferring, therefore, the opening of
the bag to the second act, he proceeded with the first.</p>
            <p>"Now, Mr. Maxwell," said he, "as you have given me encouragement
that you <emph>can</emph> tell the truth, I have a few questions to
put to you."</p>
            <p>"I will answer no questions," replied Maxwell, sullenly.</p>
            <p>He saw that the mulatto would have it all his own way; and he felt
a desire to conciliate him,
but his pride forbade. He felt very much as a lion would feel in the
power of a mouse, if such a
thing could be.</p>
            <p>"Please to consider, sir. You are entirely in my power."</p>
            <p>"No matter; do with me as you please,—I will answer no questions."</p>
            <p>"Think of it; and be assured I will do my best to
<emph>compel</emph> an answer. If I do
not succeed, you will be food for the buzzards before yonder sun sets."</p>
            <p>"What, fellow! would you murder me?" exclaimed Maxwell, in alarm.</p>
            <pb n="177"/>
            <p>"I would not; if you compel me to use violence, the consequences
be upon your
own head. Will you answer me?"</p>
            <p>Maxwell hesitated. The dreadful thought of being murdered in cold
blood presented itself on
the one hand, and the scarcely less disagreeable thought of exposing
his crimes, on the other. The
loss of reputation, his prospective fall in society, were not less
terrible than death itself.
Resolving to trust in his good fortune for the result, he firmly
refused to answer.</p>
            <p>Hatchie now took the rope, and having cut off a portion from one
end, with which he
fastened together the legs of his prisoner, he ascended the tree with
an end in his hand. Passing
the rope over a smooth branch about fifteen feet from the ground, he
descended and made a
slip-noose in one end. Heedless of the remonstrances of the victim,
he fastened it securely to his
neck.</p>
            <p>Seating himself again on the log, with the other end of the rope
in his hand, he looked sternly
upon the attorney, and said,</p>
            <p>"Now, sir, I put the question again. Will you answer me?"</p>
            <p>"Never!" said Maxwell, in desperation.</p>
            <p>"Very well, then; if you have any prayers to say, say them now;
your time is short."</p>
            <p>"Fool! villain! murderer! I have no prayers to say. I am not a
drivelling idiot, or fanatic; I can
die like a man."</p>
            <p>"You had better reconsider your determination."</p>
            <p>"No, craven! woolly-headed coward! I will not flinch. Do you think
to <emph>drive</emph>
a gentleman into submission?"</p>
            <p>"Be calm, Mr. Maxwell; do not waste your last moments in idle
invectives. The time were
better spent in penitence and prayer."</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! go on, if you dare, with your murderous work!"</p>
            <p>Hatchie now unloosed the cords which secured the attorney<pb n="178"/>
to the tree, and he
stood bound hand and foot beneath the branch over which the line was
passed. Seizing the end of
the rope, the mulatto pulled it gently at first, but gradually
increasing the pressure upon the
prisoner's throat, as if to give him a satisfactory foretaste of the
hanging sensation. This slow
torture was too much for the attorney's fortitude; and, as his
respiration grew painful, he called to
his executioner to stop. Hatchie promptly loosened the rope.</p>
            <p>After giving the victim time to recover from the choking
sensation, the mulatto repeated his
question.</p>
            <p>The fear of an ignominious death, of dying under such revolting
circumstances, had a cooling
effect upon the bravado spirit of the lawyer. His pride had received
a most salutary shock, and he
felt disposed to treat for his life, even with the despised slave of
Miss Dumont. Had his tormentor
been any other than one of that detested race, he could easily have
regarded him as a man, and
conceded something for the boon of life. Reduced to the last
extremity by the relentless energy of
his victor, he had no choice but to yield the point or die.</p>
            <p>"Will you answer my questions?" repeated Hatchie, sternly.</p>
            <p>"What would you have me answer?" replied Maxwell, doggedly.</p>
            <p>"Did you forge the will by which my mistress is deprived of her rights?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"Do you know who did?"</p>
            <p>Maxwell hesitated, and Hatchie again pulled the rope till his face
was crimson.</p>
            <p>"Who forged the will?" repeated Hatchie, slackening the rope.</p>
            <p>"I did not," replied Maxwell, as soon as he could regain breath
enough to speak.</p>
            <p>"Who did?"</p>
            <p>"I know not."</p>

            <p>Hatchie pulled the rope again.</p>
            <p>"Your master—"</p>
            <p>"I have no master. Miss Emily is my mistress."</p>
            <p>"I have been told his name was De Guy."</p>
            <p>"Who is De Guy?"</p>
            <p>"A lawyer of New Orleans."</p>
            <p>"And what agency had you in the affair?"</p>
            <p>"None whatever."</p>
            <p>"Then Mr. Dumont and De Guy are the only persons concerned in the
transaction."</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"You are positive?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"Then, how comes it, Mr. Maxwell, that they have intrusted you
with their secret? How
came you by this knowledge?" said Hatchie, fiercely, as he prepared,
apparently, to swing up the
attorney.</p>
            <p>Maxwell was staggered by this question, and Hatchie perceived his
discomfiture. That
Maxwell had any agency in the transaction he only suspected;
certainly it was not he whom he
had seen with Jaspar on the night of his escape from Bellevue. There
was much evidence for and
much against him.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, unwilling to criminate himself, was in a sad dilemma; his
ready wits alone could
save him. But his hesitation procured him another instant of suffocation.</p>
            <p>"I obtained the knowledge from De Guy," said he, at last.</p>
            <p>"How! did he voluntarily betray the confidence of his employer?"</p>
            <p>"No, from his inquiries concerning the affairs of the family, I
suspected something; when the
will was read my impressions were confirmed. I charged him with the crime."</p>
            <p>"Did he acknowledge it?"</p>
            <p>"He did."</p>
            <p>"Then why did you not expose the plot?"</p>
            <pb n="180"/>
            <p>"It did not suit my purpose."</p>
            <p>"What was your purpose?"</p>
            <p>"To marry Miss Dumont."</p>
            <p>The attorney's answers seemed plausible. His actions were in
conformity with his avowed
purpose. If he wished to marry his mistress, he would not have joined
in the plot. But the bill of
sale, which Emily had mentioned to him, was against him. Poor Hatchie
was no lawyer, and was
sadly perplexed by the conflicting testimony.</p>
            <p>"Where did you get that bill of sale?" said he.</p>
            <p>Again the attorney hesitated, and again Hatchie pulled the rope
till he was ready to answer.</p>
            <p>"Is it a forgery?" said Hatchie, slackening the rope.</p>
            <p>"Probably it is," replied Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"Who wrote it?"</p>
            <p>"De Guy."</p>
            <p>"This De Guy is a most consummate villain, and shall yet be
brought to justice. But how
came it in your possession?"</p>
            <p>"I received it from De Guy, as the agent of Mr. Dumont. In fine, I
<emph>bought</emph>
the girl," said Maxwell, maliciously.</p>
            <p>Hatchie's temper had nearly got the better of him, for he made a
spring on the rope, which
threatened death to the attorney. But his judgment overcame his
passion, and he again turned his
attention to the great object before him.</p>
            <p>"Now, Mr. Maxwell, as you are a lawyer," said Hatchie, "you are
aware of the disadvantages
I shall labor under in making the evidence you have furnished me
available."</p>
            <p>"I am," replied the attorney. "Do you think I would have yielded
to you, if I had not known
it?"</p>
            <p>"Have you told me the truth in these statements?" asked Hatchie.</p>
            <p>The attorney hesitated; but a sharp twinge at the neck compelled
him to say that he had.</p>
            <p>"Then I shall be obliged to trouble you to repeat some of your
revelations. Now, mark me,
Mr. Maxwell; I am going<pb n="181"/>
to procure the woodman and his son, to witness your
statements."</p>
            <p>"Fool! what avail will they be, extorted with a rope about my neck?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps we may be able to show you some law such as you never
read in your books. If, as
I suspect, this carpetbag contains papers, I doubt not we shall find
something to confirm your
evidence."</p>
            <p>The face of the lawyer grew a shade paler; but he spoke not.</p>
            <p>"Before I go, let me charge you, at your peril, not to be
obstinate; for here I solemnly assure
you that you shall swing by the branch above you, if you refuse to
answer," said Hatchie, going
towards the cabin.</p>
            <p>The scene of this exploit was at some distance from the log-cabin
of the woodman, and the
mulatto had scarcely got out of sight before Vernon appeared. He had
been at a little distance
from the parties during the whole scene, but he had too much respect
for the prowess of his late
conqueror to venture on a rescue. He had once been tempted to do so,
and had made the noise
which had disturbed Hatchie. The blackleg, without much sympathy for
his confederate, had
rather regarded the whole scene as a good joke than as a serious
affair; and, as he approached the
lawyer, his merriment and keen satire were not relished by the victim.</p>
            <p>"But how is it, Maxwell, about this will? You have never told me
about it," said Vernon,
who, ruffian as he was, believed in fair play.</p>
            <p>"I will tell you another time; cut these ropes, and let us be off."</p>
            <p>"But let me tell you, my fine fellow, that though I can rob a man
who has enough, I would
not be concerned in such a dirty game as this," said Vernon, as he
severed the ropes which bound
the attorney. "If you have been helping old Dumont to wrong his
niece, may I be hanged, as that
nigger would have served you, if I don't blow the whole affair!"</p>
            <pb n="182"/>
            <p>"You know nothing about it; but, let me tell you, I am not
concerned in the affair.
The girl, I have no doubt, is a slave."</p>
            <p>The confederates now made all haste to depart from their proximity
to such dangers as both
had incurred, and, by a circuitous way, reached the river, where,
taking a boat, they rowed under
the banks down stream.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was disappointed, on his return, to find his prisoner had
escaped. A diligent search,
by the precaution of the confederates, was rendered fruitless.</p>

            <p>JASPAR DUMONT sat in the library at Bellevue. It
was the evening after his return from Vicksburg. Near him, engaged in
examining a heap of
papers, was his new overseer, Dalhousie.</p>
            <p>Jaspar was musing over the late turn his affairs had taken; and,
while he congratulated
himself on his present triumphant position, he could but regard with
apprehension the future,
which seemed to smile only to lure him on to certain destruction. The
trite saying, "There is no
peace for the wicked," is literally and universally true. The
lowering brow, the threatening scowl,
the suspicious glance, of the wicked uncle, were as reliable
evidences of his misery as his naked
soul, torn with doubt and anguish, could have been. Every new paper
the overseer turned over
produced a start of apprehension, lest it might contain evidence of
his villany. His nerves had
suffered terribly beneath the vision of guilt and punishment that
constantly haunted him. His new
overseer, whom he had partially admitted to his bosom as a confidant,
had secured a strong hold
upon his fears. His presence seemed necessary to cheer him in his
lonely hours, to chase away
the phantoms of vengeance that pursued him. Harassed by doubts and
fears, his constitution was,
in some<pb n="184"/>
degree, impaired, and his mind, losing the pillar upon which it rested, was
prone to yield also.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie examined with minuteness the papers to which his
attention had been directed.
Before him was a heap of documents of various kinds, all in
confusion,—bills and bonds,
letters and deeds, were thrown promiscuously together. His purpose
was to sort and file them
away for future reference. This confusion among the papers was not
the work of Colonel
Dumont; he had been strictly methodical and accurate in all his
business affairs. This fact was
attested by the occasional strips of pasteboard, on which were marked
various descriptions of
papers, as well as by bits of red tape that had secured the bundles.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie perceived that the labyrinth he was engaged in exploring
had not been the labor of
the former owner of Bellevue, and he was perplexed to understand why
Jaspar had taken such
apparent pains to disarrange them. But Jaspar did have a motive; he
had produced the disorder in
his careless search for any paper which might be evidence against
him. So heedlessly, however,
had he ransacked the drawers, that, if any such were there, they must
have escaped his notice. He
was too much excited to do the work with the attention his own safety
demanded.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie continued to examine the papers, and Jaspar still
trembled lest something might
turn up which would give the overseer a confirmation of the opinions
he had expressed at
Vicksburg. Still Jaspar had not the courage to undertake the task
himself. He allowed the
overseer to perform it, in the very face of the danger he wished to escape.</p>
            <p>The overseer seemed to Jaspar's troubled vision perfectly
indifferent. He could discover no
anxiety in his features, to indicate that he had any other purpose
than to do his employer's
bidding. A more close inspection would have developed a slight
twinkle, as of anticipation, in
the marble face of Dalhousie.</p>
            <p>As he turned paper after paper, his eye rested upon a<pb n="185"/>
packet enclosed in a blank
envelope. His curiosity was aroused, and, glancing indifferently at
Jaspar, he saw that his
piercing eye regarded him with intense scrutiny. Continuing his labor
without disturbing the
mysterious packet, he waited until the sharp eye of his companion was
removed from him.</p>
            <p>On the table by the side of Jaspar was a bottle of brandy, at
which, at short intervals, the
miserable man paid his devoir. Dalhousie did not, therefore, have to
wait long before the keen
watcher left his chair, and, with his back to him, took a long
draught of the exciting beverage.
The overseer, seizing the favorable opportunity, slipped the packet
into his pocket. As
indifferently as before, he completed the task, and Jaspar was
relieved when he saw the papers
again filed away.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie sought his room, and, scarcely heeding the salutation of
his wife, he seated
himself, and drew forth the packet. Removing the blank envelope, he
found it was a letter,
directed to "Emily Dumont," with a request to Mr. Faxon that it might
be delivered to her after
the writer's decease. This seemed to imply that the writer had
intended the clergyman as the
keeper of the letter; but with this surmise the overseer did not
trouble himself. He turned the
letter over and over, examined the seal of Colonel Dumont, which was
upon it, and, at last, as
though he had satisfied the warning voice of conscience, he snapped
the wax, and opened it. The
letter was quite a lengthy one, yet, without raising his eyes, he
completed the reading of it. A
faint smile of satisfaction played upon his lips, as he re-folded the
paper, and returned it to the
envelope.</p>
            <p>"You have a letter, Francois?" said his wife, who had watched him
in silence as he read, and
who noticed the complacent smile its contents had produced.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Delia, and our fortune is at last come," replied Dalhousie,
rising, and bestowing a kiss
upon the fair cheek of the lady.</p>
            <pb n="186"/>
            <p>"Is it from France?"</p>
            <p>"No, dear; it is from the land of spirits!" answered Dalhousie,
with a good-natured laugh.</p>
            <p>"Indeed! I was not aware that you had a correspondent there."</p>
            <p>"But I have; and I am exceedingly obliged to him for putting me in
possession of such useful
information as this letter contains."</p>
            <p>"Pray, who is your ghostly correspondent?"</p>
            <p>"Colonel Dumont,—a deceased brother of the worthy Jaspar, in
whose employ we
now are."</p>
            <p>"Do not jest, Francois!" said the lady, as a feeling akin to
superstition rose in her mind.</p>
            <p>"Jest or not, the letter was written by him," continued her
husband, still retaining his playful
smile.</p>
            <p>"To you?"</p>
            <p>"Not exactly; but I presume he meant it for me, or it would not
have slipped so easily
through Mr. Dumont's fingers into mine."</p>
            <p>"To whom is it directed, Francois?"</p>
            <p>"You grow inquisitive, Delia. I will tell you all about it in a
few days. I must go now and see
that the hands are all in their quarters;" and Dalhousie, to avoid
unpleasant interrogatories, left
the room.</p>
            <p>The overseer went the rounds of the quarters, more as a matter of
form than of any interest he
felt in his occupation. A gentleman by birth and education, these
duties were extremely
distasteful to him,—embraced because necessity compelled him.
His mind seemed far
away from his business, for a party of negroes passed him on his
return, upon whom he did not
bestow the usual benediction the boys receive when found out after hours.</p>
            <p>"Strike while the iron is hot," muttered he, as he entered the
house, and gave his lantern to a
servant. "If I don't do it to-night, it may be too late another time.
The letter is<pb n="187"/>
in safe
hands; and, as to the other traps, I must get them if I can. At any
rate, I will try."</p>
            <p>Approaching the door of the library, he knocked, and was requested
to enter. Under pretence
of receiving directions for his next day's operations upon the
plantation, he entered; and opened a
conversation with Jaspar. Walking carelessly up and down the room
while his employer issued
his commands, he occasionally cast a furtive glance at the secretary.
Then, narrowing down his
walk, he approached nearer and nearer to it, until his swinging arm
could touch it as he passed.
Finally he stopped, and leaned against the secretary, with his hands
behind him. He appeared
very thoughtful and attentive, while Jaspar, glad to find a theme he
could converse upon,
expatiated upon his favorite methods of managing stock and crops. The
overseer listened
patiently to all he said, occasionally interrupting with a word of
approbation. The enthusiastic
planter, suspecting nothing of the overseer, labored diligently in
his argument, and did not notice
that, when the attentive listener carelessly put his hands into his
pockets, he conveyed with them
the key of one of the drawers.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie, having effected the object which brought him to the
library, soon grew tired of
the planter's arguments, and edged towards the door, through which he
rather rudely made his
exit.</p>
            <p>Jaspar again relapsed into the moody melancholy from which the
presence of the overseer
had roused him. Sinking back into his chair, he again was a prey to
the armed fears that
continually goaded him. Occasionally he roused from his stupor, and,
driven by the startling
apparition of future retribution, paced the room in the most intense
nervous excitement. Frequent
were the stops he made at the brandy-bottle on the table; but, for a
time, even the brandy-fiend
refused to comfort him,—refused to excite his brain, or pour a
healing balm upon his
consuming misery. Again he sunk into his chair, overcome by the
torture of his emotions, and<pb n="188"/>
again the gnawing worm forced him to the bottle, until, at last,
nearly stupefied by the
liquor, he slumbered uneasily in his chair. But the terrible
apparition, which seldom left him
when awake, was constant in his dreams; and, just as he was about to
plunge into the awful abyss
that always yawned before him, he awoke, and staggered to the bottle
again. A gleam of
consciousness now visited his inebriated mind, and he bethought
himself of retiring. With a dim
sense of his usual precaution, he reeled to the secretary, and
attempted to lock the drawers. He
discovered that one key was missing; but, too much intoxicated to
reason upon the circumstance,
he took another draught of brandy, and ambled towards his
sleeping-room. He was too far gone
to effect a landing at the head of the stairs, and fell full-length
upon the floor when he released
his hold of the banister.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie was still up, and his knowledge of Jaspar's habits
enabled him to judge the
occasion of the noise he heard, and he immediately hastened to the
rescue. "Lucky!" muttered he,
as he lifted the fallen man. "He must have been intoxicated when he
examined those papers, or
he would have seen that letter."</p>
            <p>Jaspar, who had not entirely lost his senses, muttered something
about an accident, and clung
closely to his companion, who soon deposited him on his bed.</p>
            <p>The overseer, instead of returning to his room, descended to the
library, where the light was
still burning. Locking the door, he seated himself in the large
stuffed chair, and drew from his
pocket the letter he had purloined from the secretary. Opening it, he
proceeded to a re-perusal of
it. The letter was as follows:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <div type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>"MY DEAR CHILD:—When you
read this letter, your father will be
no more. The last act of affection will have been performed, and the ground
closed over your only earthly protector. I am aware that you will be exposed to
many trials and temptations. The latter you are, I trust, prepared to<pb n="189"/>
resist; the former must come to all. I feel that I have done my duty
to you, not
only in bestowing an abundance of this world's goods, but that I have
not entirely
failed to implant in your mind the treasure 'which neither moth nor rust can
corrupt.' I have done all that I could do, and in a short time I must
lay my body in
the grave, and leave you an orphan. But you are in the hands, and under the
protection, of a Father who is infinitely more able to take care of
you than I have
been. Into His hands, with my ransomed spirit, I undoubtingly commit
you.</p>
                     <p>"As I write this letter, I feel the hand of death upon me.
In a few short days, it
may be only hours, I must go. I am the less ready to bid you the
everlasting adieu
when I think of the dangers that may surround you. In my last hours I am doomed
to the torments of suspicion. I pray God they may be groundless.
Perhaps they are
only idle fancies, the dotings of an over-anxious father. I feel, as
the sands of life
are fast ebbing out, that some great calamity is lowering over you. I
know not that
a remark I accidentally overheard should thus haunt me; but it has roused my
suspicions, and the presage of calamity will not depart from me. I
cannot, with the
warning voice ever ringing in my mind, help taking steps to guard you
against the
worst that may befall you.</p>
                     <p>"My dear child, if I should disclose
my suspicions, and they should prove
unreasonable, I shall have done a grievous wrong to him I suspect. Although you
cannot save me from the misery of doubting in my last hour, you can save me
from injuring another in your good opinion. If I have wronged him,
let the injury
die with me. If my suspicions are not groundless, I offer you the
means of saving
yourself from the calamity that impends.</p>
                     <p>"Should any event
occur after my death which deprives you of any of your
inheritance, follow the directions I now give you.</p>
                     <p>"In the back
of the lower drawer of the secretary you will<pb n="190"/>
find a secret aperture. The back of the drawer is a thick board, upon which
is screwed,
on the lower side, a thin slat. Take out the screws and remove the piece they
secure, and the aperture will be seen. It contains a sealed packet,
the contents of
which require no explanation.</p>
                     <p>"If nothing happens after my
decease, and you peaceably obtain all your
rights, burn the packet without opening it. My unjust suspicions, then, cannot
influence you, or injure the person to whom they refer.</p>
                     <p>"This
letter you will receive from Mr. Faxon, to whom I recommend you for
counsel and consolation in every trial.</p>
                     <p>"And now, my child, I
must bid you farewell. I feel my end approaching. May
God forever bless and preserve you!</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>Dalhousie perused and re-perused this letter, until its contents
were fixed in his mind. He had
many doubts and scruples, both prudential and conscientious, in
regard to the step he was about
to take: but the chimera of fortune prompted him to risk all in the
great project he had matured.
Taking from his pocket a small screw-driver, with which he had
prepared himself, he opened the
drawer designated in the letter, the key of which he had secured.
Emptying the drawer of its
contents, he turned it over, and, to his great delight, perceived the
slat as described in the letter.
Removing the screws, he soon had the satisfaction of holding in his
hand the packet which, he
doubted not, would restore the heiress of Bellevue to her home and
her estates, if she were still
alive; or which would give him a hold upon Jaspar, by means of which
he could make his
fortune.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie was not a natural-born villain. It was the pressure of
necessity, the almost
unconscious yielding of a weak resolution, which had led him thus far
in his present illegal and
dishonorable course. Of the heiress he knew nothing; and the thought
of restoring her had never
entered<pb n="191"/>
his head, much more his heart. The great purpose of his life was to make his
fortune, and it was this idea alone which influenced him in the
present instance. He had entered
upon his duties at Bellevue only the day before; but so impatient was
he to realize the hope
which had brought him there, that every hour seemed burdened with the
weight of weeks.</p>
            <p>Carefully depositing its contents as he had found them, he locked
the drawer, and put the key
upon the floor.</p>

            <p>HATCHIE was chagrined at the loss of his prisoner. His diligent
search was of
no avail. The Chalmetta's boat, which lay at the wood-yard in the
morning, was gone; so he had
no doubt Maxwell had made his escape in it. Having no further motive
in remaining at the
wood-yard, he procured a small canoe, with the intention of joining
his mistress at Cottage
Island.</p>
            <p>Seated in the stern of the canoe, Hatchie propelled it with only
sufficient force to avoid the
eddies which would have whirled his frail bark in every direction.
His thoughts wandered over
the events of the past few days. He moralized upon the conduct of the
attorney and the uncle, and
nursed his indignation over them. Hatchie was a moralist in his own
way, but not a moralist only.
The great virtue of his philosophy, unlike much of a more scholastic
origin, was its practical
utility. From the past, with its conquered trials, he turned to the
future, to inquire for its dangers,
to ask what snares it had spread to entangle the fair being whom he
worshipped with all a lover's
fondness, without the lover's sentiment.</p>
            <p>We will not follow him in his peregrinations through the mazes of
the misty future, for they
were interrupted by the appearance on the water of a distant object,
which excited<pb n="193"/>
his
attention. A searching and anxious scrutiny convinced him that it was
the boat in which Maxwell
had made his escape. Though at a great distance from him, he could
see that it contained two
men. Guardian as he was of his mistress' honor and safety, the sight
awakened all his fears and
called up all his energy. Did they know that his mistress had gone to
Cottage Island? It was
possible that Vernon had obtained a knowledge of her movements. The
faithful fellow was
almost maddened at the thought.</p>
            <p>The boat approached Cottage Island, and Hatchie observed them pull
in under the high bank.
This movement was ominous of evil, and all the mulatto's fears were
confirmed, when, as they
passed the mouth of the little stream, he saw one of them rise in the
boat and point it out.
Satisfied that his canoe was yet unnoticed by his enemies, and
dreading no immediate danger, he
paddled across the river so as to bring the island between them. When
he had gained a position
which hid him from their view, he used all his immense strength in
propelling the canoe towards
the island. A few minutes sufficed to bring him up with the western
shore of the islet, his
enemies being upon the opposite side. Keeping close to the high bank,
he paddled down-stream
to the lower extremity of the island, where the sound of voices
caused him suddenly to check his
progress, and gain a landing. Drawing the canoe out of reach of the
current, he climbed up the
bank, which, being near the down-stream end of the island, sloped
gradually down, till it
terminated in the low, sandy beach.</p>
            <p>He reached the high bank without attracting the attention of the
party of whose motions he
wished to obtain a knowledge. He could now distinctly hear their
conversation, though they were
still at a considerable distance from him. Cautiously he climbed a
thick cotton-wood tree, whose
foliage completely screened him from observation, and there awaited
the nearer approach of
Maxwell and his confederate.</p>
            <pb n="194"/>
            <p>"Are you sure this is the island?" said Maxwell, when they had come within
hearing of Hatchie.</p>
            <p>"This must be the one," replied Vernon. "We shall soon see whether
it is inhabited or not."</p>
            <p>"With whom did the girl leave the wood-yard?"</p>
            <p>"With a doctor who lives like a hermit on this island. I saw them
from a distance get into the
sail-boat, and I asked a boatman for the particulars."</p>
            <p>"Who is the doctor?"</p>
            <p>"Don't know. The boatman said it was an outlandish name, and he
had forgotten it. You
mean to have the girl, do you?"</p>
            <p>"I do, if possible."</p>
            <p>"O, it's quite possible—nothing easier. You say the girl
belongs to you?"</p>
            <p>"I do; did I not show you the bill of sale?"</p>
            <p>"That might be a trick of your own, you know. It 's a devilish
queer story."</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! man, are you crazy? This thing has startled your
conscience more than all the crimes
of a lifetime. What has gotten into you, Vernon? I never knew you to
moralize before."</p>
            <p>"Look here, my boy, I can do almost anything; but I would not
wrong a woman,—no,
not a <emph>woman</emph>,—I am above that," said Vernon, with
much emphasis.</p>
            <p>"But, man, she is my slave—a quadroon."</p>
            <p>"Property's property; but since I met the girl in the boat, I am
half inclined to believe she is
no quadroon. Maxwell, I had a sister once, and may my body be rent
into a thousand pieces but I
would tear out the heart of the man who would serve her as you do
this girl. If she is your <emph>property</emph>, why, that alters the
case."</p>
            <p>"Certainly it does; so, end your sermon, and tell me how to gain
possession of my <emph>property</emph>."</p>
            <p>"We can storm the island."</p>
            <p>"What! two of us?"</p>
            <pb n="195"/>
            <p>"I can get plenty of soldiers, if you will pay them."</p>
            <p>"I will give a thousand dollars for her; and, if I get her again,
by heavens, she shall not
escape me! I will put a pair of ruffles on her wrists such as the
dainty girl never got of her
milliner. How many persons are on the island?"</p>
            <p>"That I don't know—perhaps half a dozen. Your hangman will
be there," and Vernon
chuckled at the thought of the scene he had witnessed near the wood-yard.</p>
            <p>Maxwell's teeth grated, and Hatchie distinctly heard the
malediction he bestowed upon him.
Fears for his personal safety did not, for a moment, disturb him.
Prudence alone prevented him
from rushing upon the villains, and thwarting in its embryo stage
their design upon his mistress.</p>
            <p>"You mean," said Maxwell, "to take the girl from the house by force?"</p>
            <p>"There is no other way."</p>
            <p>"Then we had better examine the island, or it will not be an easy
matter to land in a dark
night."</p>
            <p>"How does the owner land?"</p>
            <p>"Probably by the little stream we saw above."</p>
            <p>"Rather difficult navigation for a stranger. We had better land in
this part of the island. Let us
walk through the thicket and find the house."</p>
            <p>Hatchie saw them attempt to pass through the thick brush; but the
task was not an easy one.
By the aid of a bowie-knife, with which they cut away some of the
bushes, they penetrated to the
larger growth of trees, where the under-brush no longer impeded their
progress. They passed
beyond the hearing of the mulatto, though from his elevated position
he occasionally obtained a
view of them, as they approached the cottage. Anxiously he waited
their return, in the hope of
getting more definite ideas of the time and method of the proposed
attack upon the island. After a
careful survey of the premises, Maxwell and Vernon returned to their
former position.</p>
            <p>"Quite an easy job," said Vernon; "the only difficulty is<pb n="196"/>
this thick brush, which
can be easily removed. I will cut away a part now."</p>
            <p>"Very well," responded Maxwell, as his associate proceeded to cut
away the bushes, and
form a pathway through the thicket. "When shall the thing be done?"</p>
            <p>"As to that I can hardly say. When we get to Vicksburg we can
decide. Better let the girl rest
a week or so; for it may take that time to get things ready. You
can't hire men to do such work as
easily as you can to cut wood and dig ditches. It takes skill and caution."</p>
            <p>"Very well, I am in no haste."</p>
            <p>For nearly an hour Vernon labored at his task, and completed a
path through which the party
could easily pass to the cottage.</p>
            <p>The object of their visit accomplished, Hatchie saw them return to
their boat, and row down
the river. After they had disappeared round a bend, he descended from
the tree, and examined the
labors of Vernon. He found the bushes which had been cut down were
nicely placed at each end
of the path in an upright position, so as to conceal it from the eyes
of the passer. For a long time
the mulatto reflected upon the conversation he had heard, and
considered the means of defeating
the diabolical plot. Against a band of ruffians, such as Vernon would
enlist for the service, he
could not contend single-handed. To remove his mistress from the
island, while Henry Carroll
lay helpless there, would not be an acceptable proposition to her.
Resolving to lay the
information he had gained before Dr. Vaudelier, he returned to his
canoe, and, having rounded
the island, reached the cottage by the usual passage.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>Henry Carroll still slept. For six hours he had lain under the
influence of the powerful opiate.
Emily entered his chamber in company with the doctor, on their return
from the wood-yard. The
sight of Henry, pale and worn as he <orig>ap-</orig>
               <pb n="197"/>
peared, excited
all her sympathy. His right arm, which was uninjured, lay extended on
the bed; she gently
grasped it, and, bending over him, imprinted upon his pallid lips a
kiss, that was unknown and
unappreciated by its recipient. Only a few days before she had
listened to the eloquent confession
of him who now lay insensible of her presence. She was a true woman,
and the presence of Dr.
Vaudelier did not restrain the expression of her woman's heart. It
was visible in her pale cheek, in
her heaving breast, and in her sparkling eye, from which oozed the
gentle tear of affectionate
sympathy.</p>
            <p>She held his hand; unconsciously, at the silent bidding of her
warm heart, she gently pressed
it. As though the magnetism of love had communicated itself to the
sleeper, he sighed heavily,
and uttered a groan of half-subdued anguish. His eyelids fluttered;
he was apparently shaking off
the heaviness of slumber. His lips quivered, and Emily heard them
faintly articulate her name.</p>
            <p>At the request of the good physician, she reluctantly withdrew
from the apartment.</p>
            <p>The sufferer endeavored to turn in the bed; the effort drew from
him a groan of agony,
which, in a more wakeful state, a proud superiority over every
weakness would not have
permitted him to utter. His eyes opened, and he stared vacantly about
the darkened chamber. The
doctor took his hand, and examined his pulse.</p>
            <p>"How do you feel, captain? Does your head ache?" asked he.</p>
            <p>"Slightly; I am better, I think," replied the invalid, faintly.</p>
            <p>"And you are better," said the doctor, with evident satisfaction.
"The scalds are doing very
well, and the wound on your head is not at all serious."</p>
            <p>"Now, sir, will you tell me where I am?"</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier imparted the information.</p>
            <p>"Emily! Emily! Won but lost again!" murmured<pb n="198"/>
Henry. "Would that we had sunk
together beneath the dark tide!"</p>
            <p>"Do not distress yourself, my dear captain. We must be careful of
this fever."</p>
            <p>"Distress myself!" returned Henry, not a little provoked at the
coolness of the doctor. "You
know not the loss I have sustained."</p>
            <p>"But you must keep calm."</p>
            <p>"Doctor, did you ever love?" asked Henry, abruptly, as he gazed
rather wildly at his host.</p>
            <p>This was a severe question to a man whose matrimonial experience
was of such a
disagreeable nature. But he remembered the day before
marriage,—the sunny dreams
which had beguiled many a weary hour,—and he sympathized with
the unhappy man.</p>
            <p>"I have," replied the doctor, solemnly, so solemnly that it
chilled the ardent blood of the
listener. "I have loved, and can understand your present state of feeling."</p>
            <p>"Then you know, if I do not regain her whom I have lost, I had
better die now than endure
the misery before me."</p>
            <p>The doctor was not quite so sure of this, but he did not express
the thought.</p>
            <p>"You will regain her," said he.</p>
            <p>"Alas! I fear not. The boat was almost a total wreck. I saw scores
of dead and dying as I
clung to my frail support."</p>
            <p>"Fear not. Believe me, captain, I am a prophet; she shall be
restored to your arms again."</p>
            <p>"I thank you for the assurance; but I fear you are not an
infallible prophet."</p>
            <p>"In this instance, I am."</p>
            <p>Henry looked at the doctor, and saw the smile of satisfaction that
played upon his usually
stern features. It augured hope—more than hope; and, as the
wrecked mariner clings to the
disjointed spar, his mind fastened upon that<pb n="199"/>
smile as the forerunner of a blissful
reunion with her his soul cherished.</p>
            <p>"Be calm, sir, be calm; she is safe," continued Dr. Vaudelier.</p>
            <p>"Do you know it?" almost shouted Henry, attempting to rise.</p>
            <p>"Be quiet, sir," said the doctor, in a voice approaching to
sternness; "be quiet, or I shall regret
that I gave you reason to hope."</p>
            <p>"Where is she?" asked Henry, sinking back at the doctor's reproof,
and heeding not the
darting pain his attempt to rise had produced.</p>
            <p>"She is safe; let this suffice. I see you cannot bear more now."</p>
            <p>"I can bear anything, sir, anything. I will be as gentle as a
lamb, if you will tell me all you
know of her."</p>
            <p>"If you keep entirely quiet, we will, in a few days, let her speak
for herself."</p>
            <p>"Then she is safe; she has escaped every danger?"</p>
            <p>"She has."</p>
            <p>"And was not injured?"</p>
            <p>"No; she was taken, it seems, from the wreck by a villain. Thank
God, she has escaped his
wiles!"</p>
            <p>Henry's indignation could scarcely be controlled, even by the
reflection that Maxwell's
wicked intentions had been turned, by an overruling Providence, into
the means of her safety.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier related to his patient the incident of the
wood-yard; not, however, without the
necessity of frequently reproving his auditor, whose exasperation
threatened serious
consequences. When, at the conclusion of the narration, he told Henry
that the loved one was at
that moment beneath his roof, he could scarcely restrain his
immoderate joy within the bounds of
that quiet which his physician demanded.</p>
            <p>"May I not see her?" said he.</p>
            <p>"That must depend entirely upon your own behavior.<pb n="200"/>
You have not shown
yourself a very tractable patient thus far."</p>
            <p>"I will be perfectly docile," pleaded Henry.</p>
            <p>"I fear I cannot trust you. You are so excitable, that you explode
like a magazine of
gunpowder."</p>
            <p>"No, no; I solemnly promise to keep perfectly quiet. She will, I
know, be glad to see me,
wounded and stricken though I am."</p>
            <p>"She has already seen you."</p>
            <p>"Indeed!"</p>
            <p>"Yes; and not content with <emph>seeing</emph> you merely, your
lips are not yet cold
from the kiss she imprinted upon them;" and a smile, not altogether
stoical, lit up the doctor's
cold expression. "You shall see her, but the instant I perceive that
the interview is prejudicial to
your nerves, I shall remove her."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, doctor!" said Henry, fervently.</p>
            <p>"O, it is part of my treatment. It may do you more good than all
my physic. I have known
such cases."</p>
            <p>"I am sure it will," returned the patient.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier retired, and after a serious charge to Emily, he
reentered, leading the Hygeia
who was to restore the sick man.</p>
            <p>"Be careful," was the doctor's monition, as he elevated his
fore-finger, in the attitude of
caution; "be careful."</p>
            <p>"O, Emily!" exclaimed Henry, more gently than the nature of the
interview would seem to
allow, as he extended his hand to her.</p>
            <p>Emily silently took the hand, and while a tell-tale tear started
from her eye, she pressed it
gently; but the pressure startled the sick man's blood, and sent it
thrilling with joy through its
lazy channels. The invalid, as much as the pressure of the hand
warmed his heart, seemed not to
be satisfied with the hand alone; for he continued to draw her
towards himself, until her form
bent over him, and their lips met. It was the first time when both
were conscious of the<pb n="201"/>
act. We will not go into ecstasies over the unutterable bliss of that
moment. We will not
deck our page with any unseemly extravagances. If the experience of
the reader has led him
through the hallowed mystery of the first kiss of love, he needs not
another's fancy to revive the
beatific vision. If not, why, thousands of coy and blushing damsels,
equally in the dark, are
waiting, from whom he may select one to assist him in solving the
mystery. Besides, it is not
always wise to penetrate the secrets of the heart, even in a novel;
for there is a sacredness about
them, a kind of natural free-masonry, which must not be made too common.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier, when he saw that the patient was disposed to behave
himself in a reasonable
manner, withdrew from the room, and left them to the undisturbed
enjoyment of their happy
reunion. In an hour he returned, and peremptorily forbade all further
conversation. He permitted
Emily to remain in the room, however, on the promise to allow the
invalid to use no further
exertion in talking.</p>
            <p>All day, like a ministering angel, she moved about his couch, and
laved his fevered brow. All
his art could not lure her into any conversation beyond the necessary
replies to his questions
concerning his physical condition. Henry was too thankful for being
permitted to enjoy her
presence to forfeit the boon by any untractableness, and, for one of
his excitable temperament, he
was exceedingly docile.</p>

            <p>IT was midnight at Cottage Island,—the
third night after the events of the preceding chapter. Henry Carroll,
by the skilful treatment of his
host, was in a great degree relieved from his severe pain, and had
now sunk into a natural and
quiet slumber. By his bedside sat Dr. Vaudelier. Emily had, an hour
before, retired to the rest
which her exhausted frame demanded. For the past three days she had
watched patiently and
lovingly by the invalid. And now she had only been induced to retire
by the promise of the
doctor to call her, if any unfavorable symptom appeared.</p>
            <p>The threatened assault upon the island had been thoroughly
considered, and for the past two
nights the island wore the appearance of a garrisoned fortress,
rather than the secluded abode of a
hermit. Emily knew of the peril which now menaced her, but the ample
means at hand for
protection rendered it insignificant. All thought, even of her own
security, was merged in her
generous interest in the comfort of the sufferer.</p>
            <p>The good physician was uneasy and disturbed, as he sat by the
bedside of his patient. The
circumstances which surrounded him were novel in the extreme.
Accustomed as he had been to
the quiet which always reigned in his domain, to find himself, as it
were, the inmate of a fortress,
in<pb n="203"/>
momentary expectation of an attack, was so singularly odd, that his natural
indifference deserted him. He had collected quite a large force of
his humble neighbors to assist
him in his present emergency, and they were now making their final
arrangements to meet the
assault.</p>
            <p>The doctor was restless; but it was not on account of any fear of
his personal
safety,—he was above that. The lonely and innocent being whom
he had undertaken to
protect had filled his mind with a sense of responsibility. A single
day had been long enough for
Emily to win a way to his affections, and he had grown to regard her
with the tender care of a
father. Occasionally he left his place at the bedside, and went to
the window, as if to assure
himself that the attack had not already commenced.</p>
            <p>In front of the cottage a different sentiment prevailed among the
motley group there
assembled. There were twenty men, including Hatchie, all armed with
rifle and bowie-knife, and
every one anxious for the fight to commence. Besides their arms, each
man was provided with a
small cord, and a torch of pitch-wood, the end of which had been
plentifully besprinkled with
turpentine.</p>
            <p>The party was composed mostly of woodmen and boatmen, who had
promptly and willingly
obeyed the doctor's summons. Like most men of their class in that
locality, they were hardy and
reckless; they had not that healthy horror of a mortal combat which
the moralist would gladly
see. Dr. Vaudelier had always been their friend; had always promptly
and kindly aided them in
their necessities, whether moral, physical, or pecuniary. As he had
laved the fevered brows of
their wives and children, so had he said prayers over their dead, in
the absence of a clergyman.
He had exhorted the intemperate and the dishonest, and with his purse
relieved the needy in their
distress. They were not ungrateful; they appreciated his many
kindnesses, and rejoiced in an
opportunity to serve him. These men, notwithstanding their rude
speech, their rough exteriors,
and their<pb n="204"/>
reckless dispositions, were true-hearted men. They reciprocated the offering
of a true friendship, not by smooth speeches and unmeaning smiles,
but by actions of manly
kindness. The philosopher in ethics may say what he pleases of the
refinements of sympathy; we
would not give a single such heart as those gathered on Cottage
Island for a whole army of
puling, sentimental, hair-splitting moralizers. They were men of
action, not of words; and,
though they hesitated not, in what they deemed a good cause, to close
with their man in deadly
combat, they were true as steel to a friend in the hour of his need.</p>
            <p>With these men the exploits of Hatchie, which had been related,
and perhaps exaggerated, by
Jerry Swinger, who was a leading spirit of the party, had been much
applauded, and he had, in
spite of the odium of his social position, obtained a powerful
influence over them. They heard
him with attention, and deferred to his skill and judgment. By his
advice, and to remove the
confusion of the affray from the vicinity of the cottage, it was
determined to receive the invaders
near the beach where he had overheard Vernon propose to land. Jerry
Swinger, whom natural
talent and the wish of the party seemed to indicate as leader,
marched the expedition towards the
avenue which had been made in the bushes by the ruffians.</p>
            <p>For so many men, excited as they were by the anticipation of a
conflict, they were
remarkably quiet and orderly. Dr. Vaudelier had cautioned them to
avoid all noise, and not to fire
a rifle unless absolutely necessary. He had also instructed them to
make prisoners of the
assailants, if possible, without injuring them.</p>
            <p>Jerry Swinger stationed his party near the avenue, ready to spring
upon and overpower the
foe, when the favorable moment should arrive.</p>
            <p>An hour passed by, and the impatience of the ambushed woodmen
seemed likely to give
their faithful leader some trouble, when the careful dip of oars near
the shore saluted<pb n="205"/>
their ears. In a whisper Jerry gave the oft-repeated caution for
silence, and charged them to be
prompt when the moment came.</p>
            <p>The assaulting party approached the shore. There were two boats,
the foremost of which
contained eight men, under the direction of Maxwell, and the other
six, led by Vernon. The latter
had reconnoitred the island several times, and had somewhat modified
the plan of the attack, on
discovering that the cottage, for the past two nights, had been
occupied by more than its usual
occupants. Several men had been seen to land there; but, as his
preparations on the lower part of
the island were undisturbed, it never occurred to him that his
purpose would be anticipated.</p>
            <p>Vernon had procured the services of fourteen men, chicken-thieves,
and others of desperate
fortunes, to engage in the enterprise, by holding out to them the
hope of plunder, of which the
cottage, he assured them, would afford an abundant harvest. The real
purpose of the expedition
was, therefore, unknown to any of the party, except the leaders. The
prospect of a sharp fight had
not in the least dampened the ardor of their hopes. With men of their
craft it was a dull season,
and the prospect of "cracking a crib" plentifully stored with
valuables was quite a pleasant
anticipation.</p>
            <p>It was arranged that Maxwell, with the larger portion of the
desperadoes, should land at the
lower part of the island, and, if any defenders appeared, commence
hostilities, and draw them
away from the house, while Vernon, with the most experienced of the
"cracks-men," should
assault the house, and effect the purpose of the enterprise. In the
person of one of the
chicken-thieves a pilot for the creek was discovered; and, to make
assurance doubly sure, it was
decided that Vernon should approach the cottage by the usual channel.</p>
            <p>Maxwell's boat was beached, while that of Vernon proceeded up the
river to the little stream.
The skill of his pilot, of whom Vernon had felt many doubts, soon brought<pb n="206"/>
him to the
creek. The current, he found, was quite rapid, and he feared it would
carry him into the midst of
the "enemy's camp" before Maxwell should have made his demonstration.
As the boat was
whirled along towards the centre of the island, for the oars could
not be used, on account of their
noise, his position seemed to grow desperate. Vernon was on the point
of risking the noise, and
taking to the oars, when he discovered an overhanging branch, which
he seized as the boat
passed under it. Fortunately for him, a bend in the stream turned the
current from the middle of
the creek, or its violence would have drawn him into the water. By
the aid of his companions, he
succeeded in making the boat fast to the branch. He listened; but all
was still. There were no
indications of the approach of the other party.</p>
            <p>Seating himself in the stern-sheets of the boat, he again
considered the operations in which
he was soon to engage; but, as these were necessarily to be directed
by the circumstances of the
moment, his deliberations soon gave way to that impatience which the
perpetrator of crime
experiences at an unexpected delay. His eager spirit was, however,
soon gratified by sounds of
conflict, which proceeded from the part of the island where Maxwell
had landed. Awhile he
listened, and the sounds grew more and more distinct. Loosing the
boat from its aerial moorings,
it was again driven by the current towards the landing in front of
the cottage. Preparations were
now made to effect the grand object, and, landing by the side of the
doctor's yacht, Vernon found
no one to oppose his progress, though the sounds from the lower
extremity of the island indicated
that the affray was growing hotter and more violent. At the head of
his party, Vernon was about
to enter the house, when the approach of a body of men from the scene
of action caused him to
pause, and await their approach.</p>
            <p>Maxwell had landed on the beach, and, not suspecting the proximity
of the ambush which
waited to receive him, had proceeded towards the avenue made at his
first visit to the<pb n="207"/>
island. Removing the loose bushes, they attempted to pass through;
but no sooner were they
fairly involved among the young trees than Jerry Swinger shouted his
first order, to light the
torches, and, in an instant, the woods were illuminated, and the
position of both parties disclosed.
This was, undoubtedly, a masterly stroke of preparation on the part
of Jerry. The torches, on the
application of the match, emitted a broad sheet of flame, which
glared upon the invaders like a
sudden flash of lightning, and utterly confounded them. It seemed
like the bolt of Omnipotence
thrown across their path in the hour of their great transgression.</p>
            <p>Maxwell was unprepared for an immediate attack. He had calculated
on effecting a junction
with Vernon in the vicinity of the cottage. Before his party had time
to recover from the panic,
they were surrounded by the resolute woodmen. The attorney, who was
as brave and active as he
was unprincipled and cunning, was not a man to be defeated without a
stout resistance.
Encouraging his party by shouts, and by his own example, a general
engagement ensued.</p>
            <p>Hatchie no sooner saw the foe of his mistress' peace, than,
stepping between him and Jerry
Swinger, who also had an account to settle with him, he knocked down
the pistol which was
levelled at his head, and grasped him by the throat. In the hands of
Hatchie the attorney was as
nothing. The stalwart mulatto cast him upon the ground, and, with his
cord, bound him hand and
foot. The leader vanquished, it was the work of but a few moments to
secure the rest of the
assailants.</p>
            <p>Jerry Swinger learned, from sundry exclamations of the defeated
party, that another portion
of the expedition was to land at the creek. Leaving a few of his men
in charge of the prisoners, he
made all haste, with the remainder, towards the cottage.</p>
            <p>The affray had occupied but a few moments. The sturdy woodmen,
accustomed to such
scenes, and animated by a high motive, had done their duty promptly
and efficiently, as the<pb n="208"/>
woful appearance of the disconcerted ruffians testified. Some hard
blows had been
dealt; some few upon both sides were severely wounded; but,
considering the desperate character
of the invaders, the masterly tact of Jerry Swinger had evidently
saved much bloodshed.</p>
            <p>Hatchie, as soon as he had secured his prisoner, hastened,
somewhat in advance of Jerry's
party, towards the cottage.</p>
            <p>Vernon waited the approach of the party in front of the cottage.
While it was yet at some
distance, he discovered Hatchie, whom he recognized by the light of
his torch, running in front of
it. The appearance of the mulatto, alone, he interpreted as the
signal of victory to the party in
conjunction with him, who, he imagined, were pursuing him. Resolving,
therefore, to lose no
more time, he advanced towards the house, ordering two of his
followers to secure Hatchie.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier had heard the sounds of the distant encounter, and
occasionally sought the
window to assure himself the invaders did not approach the cottage.
The glaring torch of
Hatchie, who was running towards the house, gave him some misgivings,
and, seizing the pistols
which lay upon the table, he went to the door, on opening which he
was confronted by Vernon.</p>
            <p>"Come on, boys! come on!" shouted the ruffian, as he pushed by the
doctor. "The way is
clear; let us make quick work."</p>
            <p>The pistol of Dr. Vaudelier had been raised to shoot down the
assailant; but his hand dropped
at the sound of his voice, he staggered back and let the weapon fall
from his hand, and uttered an
exclamation of intense feeling.</p>
            <p>"This way, men! this way!" shouted Vernon, as he pressed on.</p>
            <p>Entering the room at the right of the entry, in which a bed had
been temporarily placed for
the use of Emily, he found the affrighted girl, who had been aroused from her<pb n="209"/>
transient slumber by the noise of the attack. Rising from the bed
upon which she had merely
thrown herself, she was confounded by the appearance of her former
persecutor.</p>
            <p>"Ah, my pretty bird, you are again in my power, and I shall take
care that no weak
indulgence again deprives me of your society," said Vernon, as he
seized her arm, and attempted
to hurry her from the room.</p>
            <p>"Unhand me, villain!" exclaimed she, roused to desperation by the
sudden and painful
change which had overtaken her.</p>
            <p>"Do not pout, my pretty dove! there is no chance to escape this
time. Your valuable assistant,
that bull-headed nigger, cannot help you; so I advise you to come
quietly with me."</p>
            <p>"Never, villain! I never will leave this house alive!"—and
she struggled to free herself
from the ruffian's grasp.</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay, lady! do not be unreasonable."</p>
            <p>"Help! help!" shouted Emily, with the energy of desperation.</p>
            <p>"No use, my pretty quadroon; I put your man, Hatchie, into the
hands of two stout fellows;
he cannot come, even at your bidding."</p>
            <p>The ruffian had hardly finished the sentence before a heavy blow
on the back of the head laid
him prostrate upon the floor.</p>
            <p>"You are a false prophet," said Hatchie, quietly, as he assisted
his mistress to a sofa, while
Jerry Swinger, who had followed him, examined the condition of the
fallen man.</p>
            <p>"Thank God!" continued Hatchie, "we have beaten them off."</p>
            <p>"Heaven is kinder to me than I deserve," murmured Emily, bursting
into tears, as the terrible
scene through which she had just passed was fully realized. "But
where is Henry—Captain
Carroll—is he safe?"</p>
            <p>"All safe, ma'am; the catamounts have not been in his<pb n="210"/>
room," replied Jerry
Swinger. "Cheer up, ma'am; it mought have been worse."</p>
            <p>"Let us carry this carrion from the house," said Hatchie, seizing
the prostrate Vernon in no
gentle gripe. "Let us fasten him to a tree, and I will not take my
eye from him or the lawyer till
both are hung."</p>
            <p>"Stay, stay, Hatchie!" exclaimed Dr. Vaudelier, who at that moment
entered. "<emph>He is
my son!</emph>"</p>
            <p>"Good heavens!" said Emily, rising from her recumbent posture on
the sofa.</p>
            <p>"It is indeed true," replied the doctor, in a melancholy tone. "I
would that he had died in the
innocency of his childhood. I recognized him as he entered the house,
and had nearly lost my
consciousness, as the terrible reality stared me in the face, that my
son, he whose childhood I had
watched over, who once called me by the endearing name of father, is
a common midnight
assassin!"</p>
            <p>"Is he your persecutor?" continued the doctor, relieved by an
abundant shower of tears which
the terrible truth had called to his eyes. "Is he the person who has
caused you so much trouble?"</p>
            <p>"No, no, sir!" responded Emily, eager to afford the slightest
comfort to the bereaved heart of
the father; "he only acted for Maxwell."</p>
            <p>"A hired villain! without even the paltry excuse of an interested
motive to palliate the
offence. O God! that I should be brought so low!"—and the
doctor wrung his hands in
anguish.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps, sir," said Emily, "he is not so bad as you think; let us
hear before we condemn
him."</p>
            <p>Her resentment, if her gentle nature had for a moment harbored
such a feeling, had all given
way to the abundant sympathy she felt for the doctor in his deep
distress. Forgiving as the spirit
of mercy, she now applied restoratives to the man who had so lately
attempted to wrong her; and<pb n="211"/>
Dr. Vaudelier, with a sad heart, assisted her in her merciful duty.</p>
            <p>Hatchie, on his approach to the cottage, had been assailed by the
men whom Vernon had sent
to secure him. A severe encounter had ensued, and although Hatchie's
great muscular power and
skill had enabled him to keep his assailants at bay, he would
eventually have had the worst of it;
but Jerry Swinger came to his aid in season for him to save his
mistress from injury. Vernon's
party, like that of Maxwell, were all secured.</p>
            <p>The noise caused by the entrance of Vernon had awakened Henry
Carroll from his slumbers.
He listened, but could not make out the occasion of it; for, in
consideration of his feeble
condition, he had not been informed of the meditated attack. The cry
for help uttered by Emily
convinced him of the nature of the disturbance. His first impulse was
to rise and rush to her
assistance; but of his inability to do this he was painfully reminded
in his attempt to rise. The
heavy fall of Vernon on the floor, and the voice of Hatchie, assured
him that, whatever the affair
might be, it had assumed a new phase. His painful apprehensions were
quieted by the appearance
of Hatchie, who in a concise manner related the events of the night.</p>
            <p>The last lingering doubt of the suspicious invalid was removed by
the entrance of Emily
herself.</p>
            <p>"You are safe, dear Emily!" exclaimed he.</p>
            <p>"I am, thank God!"</p>
            <p>"And I could not assist in your defence!"</p>
            <p>"Heaven will protect me, Henry. It seems as if a veritable angel
hovered over my path to
shield me from the thousand perils that assail me."</p>
            <p>"The angels do hover around you, Emily; you are so pure, and good,
and true, that they are
ever near you, even in your own heart. Angels always minister to the
good,—to those who
resist the temptations of the world."</p>
            <pb n="212"/>
            <p>"You speak too well of me. But you have been excited by this
tumult, Henry."</p>
            <p>"I was a little disturbed; but, unable to help myself, I could do
nothing for
others,—not even for you, dearest."</p>
            <p>"I know what you would have done, if you had been able. I know
your heart, and I feel just
as grateful as though your strong arm had rescued me."</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier, who had succeeded in restoring Vernon—or, by
his true name, Jerome
Vaudelier—to consciousness, now entered the room. He appeared
more melancholy and
harassed in mind than Emily had before seen him. His soul seemed to
be crushed by the terrible
realization that <emph>his son</emph> was a common felon—worse
than felon, the
persecutor of innocence. A soul as sensitive as his to the
distinctions of right and wrong could
hardly endure the misery of that hour.</p>
            <p>With an absent manner, he inquired into the condition of the
patient, and took the necessary
steps to soothe him to slumber again.</p>
            <p>Hatchie, having satisfied himself that the prisoners were all
safe, left them under guard of the
woodmen, and returned to the chamber of the sick man; and, at the
doctor's urgent request, Emily
left Henry to his care.</p>

            <p>ON the morning following the defeat of Maxwell
and Vernon, it became necessary to make some disposition of the
prisoners, so that the
conquerors could attend to their daily duties. Their number was too
large to be left upon the
island in the absence of its defenders. A consultation between Dr.
Vaudelier and the principals of
the party took place. There were so many difficulties in the way of
bringing the invaders to
justice, that it was finally decided to release them all. The burden
of the evidence was against the
physician's son. The doctor, however much he deprecated the deed, was
anxious to save his son
from the publicity of a trial. His friends, seeing the melancholy
truth, relieved his mind by
suggesting that all of them be released, which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>Vernon had entirely recovered from the effects of Hatchie's blow,
and was seated at the
window of his apartment, contemplating the means of escape. At his
father's request, two men
had sat by him during the night, as much to prevent his escape as to
minister to his wants. The
watchers were still in the room. Vernon was not yet informed of the
relation he sustained to the
proprietor of the mansion in which he now involuntarily abode. He
thought that, considering the
unequivocal circumstances under which he had been made a prisoner, he
was treated with a great
deal of gentleness; but to him the reason was not apparent. He had been<pb n="214"/>
an alien from
his father's house for a long period, and was not acquainted with the
history of the past three or
four years of the doctor's life.</p>
            <p>His mind was now occupied in devising the means of escape; and
just as he had struck upon
a feasible project, he was interrupted by the entrance of Jerry
Swinger, who had been sent by Dr.
Vaudelier to ascertain the present frame of his son's mind, and
broach to him the tidings that he
was beneath his father's roof,—a circumstance of which his
watchers were also ignorant.</p>
            <p>"Well, stranger, how do you feel yourself, this morning?" asked Jerry.</p>
            <p>"Better. That was a cursed hard rap which some one gave me, last
night," replied
Vernon,—as, from the force of habit, we must still call him.</p>
            <p>"That are a fack, stranger; the man that gin you that blow has a
moughty hard fist; and I
advoise you to keep clear of him, or he will beat you into mince-meat."</p>
            <p>"I will try to do so."</p>
            <p>"You will larn to, if he mought have one more chance at that head
of yours."</p>
            <p>"Who is he?"</p>
            <p>"He's an oncommon fine fellow, and made your cake dough once before."</p>
            <p>"Ah, was it Miss Dumont's—that is, the quadroon's servant."</p>
            <p>"Quadroon, man!—that's all humbug. But he's the boy, and is
bound to fotch his
missus out straight, in the end."</p>
            <p>"Well, if she is his mistress, I hope he may. I wish her no harm,
however much appearances
belie me."</p>
            <p>"Is that a fack, stranger?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly; she never did me any harm."</p>
            <p>"Then what mought be the reason you were so onmerciful to her?"</p>
            <p>"I never used her hardly. My friend said she was his<pb n="215"/>
slave, and all I wished was
to have him obtain his own. In short, I was paid for my services."</p>
            <p>"No doubt of it, stranger. But I can't see how the tenth part of a
man could hunt down such a
gal as that,—it's onnateral. Besides, you didn't believe she
was a slave."</p>
            <p>"'Pon my honor I did, or I would not have lifted a finger. But I
see you have released the rest
of your prisoners,—I hope you will be as generous towards me."</p>
            <p>"Don't flatter yourself, stranger!"</p>
            <p>"I have a mortal aversion to courts of justice."</p>
            <p>"Quite likely," returned Jerry, pleased with the man's frankness.</p>
            <p>"Besides, I belong to a respectable family, who will not mind
paying something handsome to
avoid exposure."</p>
            <p>"Can't be bought, stranger; besides, respectable villains arn't
any better nor others."</p>
            <p>"True; but, you know, their friends, who are educated, are more
sensitive in such matters
than others."</p>
            <p>"That mought be true, for's aught I know; but it's mighty strange
you never thought of that
sarcumstance before."</p>
            <p>"Never was in limbo before."</p>
            <p>"That's the go, is't? Look-a-here, stranger, is it the darbies, or
the crime, which brings the
disgrace upon the family? Accordin' to my notion,—and I believe
I've got something
besides nits and lice in my head,—it 's the deed, and not the
punishment, that fotches the
disgrace. But whar does your family live?"</p>
            <p>"In New Orleans," replied Vernon, who knew nothing to the
contrary, though we are not sure
that, if he had, it would have made any difference in his reply.</p>
            <p>"And your name is Vernon?"</p>
            <p>"It is."</p>
            <p>"Is that your family name, or only a borried one?"</p>
            <p>"It is my real name," replied Vernon, not a little perplexed by
the coolness and method of the
woodman's queries.</p>
            <p>"I rather guess not," suggested Jerry, mildly.</p>
            <pb n="216"/>
            <p>"'Pon my honor—"</p>
            <p>"Think again,—maybe you mought fotch the real one to your mind."</p>
            <p>Vernon, whose temper was not particularly gentle under
contradiction, was nettled, and
disposed to be angry.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you know best," said he, conquering his passion, and
assuming one of those
peculiarly convincing smiles, which must be an hereditary possession
in the family of the "father
of lies."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps I do," replied Jerry. "If you don't know any better than
that, why, then, I do know
best. It arn't Vernon."</p>
            <p>"It is not manly, captain, to insult a prisoner," replied Vernon,
with an air of dignity, which
came from the same source as the liar's smile.</p>
            <p>"I don't mean to insult you, stranger; but facts is facts, all
over the world," said Jerry,
untouched by the other's rebuke.</p>
            <p>"What mean you?"</p>
            <p>"Nothin', stranger, only I know you. Your mother arn't livin'."</p>
            <p>"No," returned Vernon, with a start; for, with all his vices and
his crimes, a sense of respect
for the name and honor of his family had outlived the good principles
imbibed upon a mother's
knee. Although a villain in almost every sense of the word, there
were many redeeming traits in
his character, which the reader will be willing to believe, on
recalling his expressions of
conscientiousness uttered to Maxwell. Family pride is often
hereditary, and the reverses and
degradations of a lifetime cannot extinguish it. It was so with
Vernon. His real name was
unknown, even among his most intimate associates. He had early taken the
precaution—not in deference to the feelings of his
father—to assume a name; it was
from pride of birth, which shuddered more at the thought of a stain
upon the family escutcheon
than at all the crimes which may canker and corrode the heart.</p>
            <pb n="217"/>
            <p>"My mother is not living," continued he; "but how know you this?"</p>
            <p>"It don't matter, stranger. Have you seen your father lately?"</p>
            <p>"Not for many years. I am an outcast from his presence," replied
Vernon, with some
appearance of feeling.</p>
            <p>"That's onfortunate; does he know what sort of a lark you are?"</p>
            <p>"I hope not," replied Vernon, with a sickly smile.</p>
            <p>"But he does; he knows all about this ongodly scrape you got into
last night."</p>
            <p>"What mean you?" said the ruffian, sternly.</p>
            <p>"Mean? Why, just exactly what I say, Mr. Vaudelier! Don't start! I
know you as well as you
know yourself."</p>
            <p>Vernon bit his lips; he was confounded at hearing his name
uttered,—a name which
had not greeted his ears for many years. His passion was disarmed
before the rude but cutting
speech of the woodman, whose knowledge of human nature, bred in the
woods as he had been,
was remarkable. There are men in the world, supposed to be entirely
intractable, who, when
rightly approached, prove as gentle as lambs. There is no evil
without its antidote, however
deeply it may be hid from the knowledge of man; and there is no man
so vile that he cannot be
reformed. The image of God, marred and disfigured as it may be,
exists in every man, at the
faultless statue exists in the rough block of marble; from which,
when the fashioning hand, aided
by the magic of genius, touches it, the image of beauty shall come
forth. So, when man, in whom
always exists the elements of the highest character, shall be
approached by the true
reformer,—the highest and truest genius,—the bright ideal
shall assume the actual
form.</p>
            <p>The woodman had touched a chord in the heart of the gambler which
vibrated at his touch. It
was not the words, but the genuine sympathy, with which they were
laden, that overcame the
indifference of the vicious man.<pb n="218"/>
Perceiving his advantage, the woodman followed it
up, repeatedly disarming the bolt of passion, which was poised in the
mind of his auditor.</p>
            <p>"Your father," said Jerry, "is a good man, and you mought go round
the world without
finding a better."</p>
            <p>"Very true!" replied Vernon, moved to a degree he was unwilling to
acknowledge.</p>
            <p>"Now, if you jest turn over a new leaf in the book of life, and
try to fotch out right in the end,
I believe the old man would cry quits on the old score."</p>
            <p>"Send those men away, captain! I will not attempt to escape."</p>
            <p>Jerry complied, and the watchers took their departure.</p>
            <p>"Where is my father?"</p>
            <p>"Close by, stranger. May be you 'd like to see him?"</p>
            <p>"On no account!"</p>
            <p>"That 's a good sign, anyhow," muttered Jerry. "You will have to
see him, I am afraid. You
are under his ruff."</p>
            <p>Vernon, completely overcome, staggered to a chair, and covered his
face with his hands.</p>
            <p>"Not so bad a boy as one mought suppose," soliloquized Jerry, as
he went to the door, and
requested the servant to summon Dr. Vaudelier. "The fellow has fed on
husks long enough, and,
as the scripter says, he is goin' to rise and go to his dad."</p>
            <p>"Do not let my father see me,—anything, rather than that!"
exclaimed Vernon, rising,
and grasping the woodman's arm. "I am a great villain!"</p>
            <p>"That's very true, stranger; but you have got into the scrape, and
the best thing you can do is
to get out on't."</p>
            <p>"How can I?"</p>
            <p>"Be an honest man."</p>
            <p>"I fear I never can be that."</p>
            <p>"Try it! There is something left of you."</p>
            <p>At this moment Dr. Vaudelier entered the room. His<pb n="219"/>
aspect was stern and
forbidding, and the son buried his face in his hands after the first
glance at him.</p>
            <p>"Jerome," said he, "you will bring my gray hairs with sorrow down
to the grave."</p>
            <p>"Easy with him, doctor, easy! He is a little touched, and, if you
manage him right, you can
fotch him over. He is under conviction now. Don't let on yet!"</p>
            <p>"Jerome, this is a sorry visit you have made me," continued the
doctor. "Are you entirely lost
to all shame, that you could thus enter my house with a band of
ruffians behind you?"</p>
            <p>"Father," said the convicted Vernon, "I did not know it was your
house, or I could never have
done it."</p>
            <p>"Alas, that a son of mine should have become a midnight assassin!"
and Dr. Vaudelier
covered his face with his hands, and sobbed like a child.</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, father!" exclaimed the repentant son. "Forgive me!"</p>
            <p>"God and your country alone can forgive crimes like yours!"</p>
            <p>"Easy with him, doctor!" interposed Jerry, fearful lest the son's
repentance should be
dissipated before the father's sternness.</p>
            <p>"I will atone for all, to the best of my ability."</p>
            <p>"Would that you might do so!"</p>
            <p>"I will! Heaven witness my sincerity!"</p>
            <p>"Your first act of atonement must be to the lady you have so
deeply injured."</p>
            <p>"I would be her slave for life!"</p>
            <p>"If you are sincere, you will disclose all you know of the wrongs
which have been inflicted
upon her."</p>
            <p>"I fear, for her sake, that my knowledge is too limited to avail
anything to her. Maxwell
assured me she was his slave, and showed me the bill of sale. I
believed him, or he could never
have had my help."</p>
            <pb n="220"/>
            <p>"You were too willing to believe him," said the doctor, sternly.</p>
            <p>"I told him, at the outset, that I would expose all I knew (which
is but little), if I discovered
she was not a slave. I will tell you all."</p>
            <p>"Let Miss Dumont be called, Jerry."</p>
            <p>Emily came at the summons, and Dr. Vaudelier informed her of the
position of the matter.</p>
            <p>"Can you forgive me, Miss Dumont, for the wrong I have done?"</p>
            <p>"Freely, sir; and may God enable you to persevere in the course
you have taken!"</p>
            <p>"Thank you! With an angel's prayer, I shall begin the new life
with the strength your good
wishes impart."</p>
            <p>Vernon now related all he knew of the machinations of the
attorney, concealing no part of his
own or his confederate's villany. Of the will he knew nothing, his
operations having been
confined to the attempts to obtain possession of her person. Dr.
Vaudelier was satisfied that his
son had told the whole truth. It was a source of much satisfaction to
him that he had chosen the
better part. His fervent prayer ascended that the penitent might be
faithful to his good resolutions.</p>
            <p>All the circumstances relating to the will were unknown to Vernon,
which was the occasion
of much congratulation both to his father and to Emily. It seemed to
relieve him from some
portion of the guilt which the subsequent transactions fastened upon
him; and, when these
circumstances were related to him, a burst of generous indignation
testified that he, the blackleg,
the robber, was above such villany. However depraved in some
respects, that vice which is
commonly called <emph>meanness</emph> had no place within him. He
was, or rather had
been, of that class of operators who "rob the rich to pay the poor;"
who have no innate love of
vice, only a desire to be free from wholesome restraint, and have at
hand, without toil or
sacrifice, the means of enjoying life to the utmost.</p>
            <pb n="221"/>
            <p>"Jerome," said Dr. Vaudelier, "this Maxwell must be watched, and,
if you are true
to yourself, no one can do this duty as well as you."</p>
            <p>"Trust me, sir! I am strong in this lady's service."</p>
            <p>"I shall not doubt you, my son, until I have occasion to do so. I
am satisfied, if Miss Dumont
is."</p>
            <p>"I feel perfectly confident in the good faith of your son, and am
indebted to him for the zeal
he manifests in my cause."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, Miss Dumont," said Vernon. "You are too generous; but,
be assured, your
confidence shall not be abused."</p>
            <p>It was determined that Vernon should immediately depart for
Vicksburg, whither Maxwell
had gone.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT was the afternoon of the same day, as Dr.
Vaudelier was reclining, upon a rustic seat near the landing, he was
surprised by the appearance
of a canoe coming down the creek. The canoe contained an elderly
gentleman, and a negro, who,
after several unsuccessful attempts, succeeded in landing the
passenger upon the little pier. He
was about fifty years of age, apparently. His hair and whiskers were
a mixture of gray and black;
his countenance was full, and his complexion florid, which contrasted
oddly with the green
spectacles that rested upon his nose.</p>
            <p>"Do I have the honor of addressing Dr. Vaudelier?" said the
stranger, in a tone so soft and
silky that the doctor could hardly persuade himself it did not
proceed from a woman.</p>
            <p>"That is my name, sir; and to whom am I indebted for this
unexpected pleasure?"</p>
            <p>"De Guy, sir,—Antoine De Guy, at your service," squeaked the
visitor, with whom the
reader is already acquainted.</p>
            <p>"Well, sir, may I inquire the object of your visit?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly, sir. I am informed there is a lady at present residing
with you, one of the
unfortunate persons who were on board the Chalmetta at the time of
her late disaster. A Miss
Dumont."</p>
            <p>"Who informed you, sir?"</p>
            <p>De Guy hesitated a little, and then said he heard a number<pb n="223"/>
of gentlemen discuss
the late disaster at the hotel in Vicksburg; that one of them had
mentioned this fact—he
really could not tell the gentleman's name.</p>
            <p>"What is your business with the lady?" asked the doctor, to whom
the idea of a new enemy
of Emily had already presented itself.</p>
            <p>"That, sir, I can best disclose to the lady in person," squeaked
the street-lawyer, with a low
bow.</p>
            <p>"This way then," and the doctor led him to the library, into which
he soon after conducted
Emily.</p>
            <p>"Miss Dumont?" said De Guy, rising and making a profound obeisance
as she entered. "My
name is De Guy."</p>
            <p>Emily bowed slightly, but made no reply.</p>
            <p>"May I beg that our interview may be private?" said the attorney,
glancing at Dr. Vaudelier.</p>
            <p>"This gentleman is my friend and confidant; it is not necessary
that he should retire," replied
Emily, as Dr. Vaudelier was moving towards the door.</p>
            <p>"Very well, madam; though I think, from the nature of my business,
you would wish it to be
confidential."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps I had better withdraw," suggested the physician.</p>
            <p>"By no means, my dear sir; if this gentleman's visit relates to
business matters, I must beg the
favor of your counsel."</p>
            <p>"As you please, Miss Dumont; I come charged with a message from
your uncle, my
respected client, Mr. Dumont."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, sir!" replied Emily, a slight tremor creeping through her
frame; "pray deliver it at
once."</p>
            <p>"It is simply to say your immediate presence at your late
residence is necessary."</p>
            <p>"Where did you see my uncle?" asked she.</p>
            <p>"At Bellevue, madam, yesterday morning. I arrived at eleven
o'clock to-day."</p>
            <p>"When did Mr. Dumont return from his journey up the river?" asked
Dr. Vaudelier.</p>
            <pb n="224"/>
            <p>De Guy reflected a moment; from the shade of displeasure on his
countenance, it
was evident he disliked the interference of the doctor.</p>
            <p>"About four days ago."</p>
            <p>"When did you last see your uncle, Miss Dumont?" asked the doctor.</p>
            <p>"I have not seen him since the second day of our
journey,"—which was the time that
Jaspar had been left at the wood-yard.</p>
            <p>"Probably, then, he has returned to Bellevue. It is singular that,
under the instructions of the
will, he should leave you in this unceremonious manner."</p>
            <p>"Not at all," interrupted De Guy.</p>
            <p>"You speak as though you were familiar with his motions," said Dr.
Vaudelier, with a
penetrating glance at the attorney.</p>
            <p>"To some extent, I am," replied the silky-toned lawyer, with a
smile which was intended to
declare his own innocence in any of the plots of Jaspar. "He has
voluntarily acquainted me with
some of the particulars of this unfortunate affair."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, sir!"</p>
            <p>"Such is the fact," continued the attorney, with professional
ease; "he has sent for Miss
Dumont in order to effect a compromise."</p>
            <p>"A compromise!" exclaimed Emily, with disdain; "there can be no
compromise, short of
restoring, absolutely, my rights!"</p>
            <p>"It is very probable he is quite ready to do so," replied the
accommodating attorney.</p>
            <p>"May I ask what has produced this singular and sudden change in
the purpose of my uncle?"</p>
            <p>"Well, madam, it would be difficult to explain the precise
reasons. His mind seemed
troubled; I advised him to unburden to me, which he did. The
conclusion of the whole<pb n="225"/>
matter is, he has taken this step by my advice," said De Guy, with an
air of the deepest
humility.</p>
            <p>Emily was somewhat moved, by the revelation of the attorney, from
the stern reserve she had
manifested, and said,</p>
            <p>"I am grateful for your interest in my behalf."</p>
            <p>"Do not mention it, madam. There is a pleasure in doing one's
duty, which is superior to
every other gratification."</p>
            <p>"May I ask what prompted you to give such advice?" asked Dr.
Vaudelier, incredulously.</p>
            <p>"The consciousness that my duty to this lady demanded it. It was
not exactly in keeping with
the profession, I am aware; but I felt obliged to sacrifice
professional consistency to the call of
justice," said the attorney, in such a way as to leave it doubtful
whether he was perpetrating a jest
or a moral axiom.</p>
            <p>"Humph!" said the doctor, with a doubtful sneer.</p>
            <p>"Principle before professional advantage, is my motto, sir,"
continued De Guy.</p>
            <p>"Pray, what gave you the first intimation that all was not right
between this lady and her
uncle?"</p>
            <p>"The voluntary confession of Mr. Dumont," replied De Guy, readily.</p>
            <p>"You do not believe Mr. Dumont would have abandoned his purpose,
just as it was in the
very act of being consummated, without a strong motive."</p>
            <p>"True; I understand that the body-servant of the late Colonel
Dumont is upon this island. He
must have informed the lady, by this time, of his share in the
transaction."</p>
            <p>"Well."</p>
            <p>"And Mr. Dumont saw the boy the night before he left the steamer."</p>
            <p>"True."</p>
            <p>"Was not the reappearance, the rising from the dead,<pb n="226"/>
of this man, quite enough to
convince him that all his plans had failed?"</p>
            <p>"Why so?"</p>
            <p>"The boy had the will!"</p>
            <p>"It is all plain to me," said Emily, more disposed to trust De Guy
than Dr. Vaudelier was.</p>
            <p>"Perfectly plain, madam; it is not at all strange that he should
adopt this course. He must trust
to his niece's good-nature to save him from exposure."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps this is only a plan to get the lady into his power
again," suggested Dr. Vaudelier.</p>
            <p>"I assure you it is not. He is sorely troubled in mind, even now,
at the guilt which is fastened
upon him. His conscience is awakened."</p>
            <p>"And well it might be," said the doctor.</p>
            <p>"True," responded the silky attorney, with an appearance of honest
indignation; "but when
we see a man disposed to repent, we should be ready to assist him."</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier involuntarily turned his thoughts to the incidents of the
morning,—called to mind the feelings which had been awakened in
the presence of his
penitent son, and he felt the full force of De Guy's argument.</p>
            <p>"If Mr. Dumont is disposed to repent of the injury he has done his
niece, and make
atonement for it, I should, by all means, advise her to follow the
course which, I am sure, her
gentle nature suggests. 'To err is human; to forgive, divine.' The
lady is a Christian, and will act
in the true spirit of Christianity."</p>
            <p>"I trust she will," responded De Guy, meekly; "I trust she will,
and, with all convenient haste,
try to mitigate his distress."</p>
            <p>"I will! I will!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you will accompany me, as your uncle suggests,"
insinuated De Guy.</p>
            <p>"There is certainly no need of such haste as this," said the doctor.</p>
            <pb n="227"/>
            <p>"Her uncle may change his mind."</p>
            <p>"Then his penitence is not sincere, and he cannot be trusted."</p>
            <p>"I should scarcely call it penitence, sir, since it is only the
fear of discovery which has driven
him to this step," said the attorney, branching off into a new school
of ethics.</p>
            <p>"I can go in a few days," said Emily. "Captain Carroll, you think,
is out of danger now?"</p>
            <p>De Guy started, and a scowl of the deepest malignity overshadowed
his countenance, which
had before been that of a meek and truthful man. The change was so
sudden that he seemed to be
a man within a man, and the two creatures of an opposite character.
Neither the doctor nor Emily
noticed the start, or the sudden change of expression; and the
attorney, seemingly aware of the
danger of wearing two faces, restored the former aspect.</p>
            <p>"I think he is entirely out of danger," replied Dr. Vaudelier, in
reply to Emily's question.
"Perhaps he will be able to accompany you in a few days."</p>
            <p>Emily blushed, but made no reply, other than a sweet smile,
betokening the happiness such
an event would give her.</p>
            <p>"I fear, madam, the delay will be dangerous," suggested De Guy,
who did not relish the
proposition of the doctor.</p>
            <p>"Why dangerous? If Mr. Dumont changes his mind, we have the means
of proving that that
miserable will is false."</p>
            <p>"You forget, sir, that Mr. Benson may be lost, and with him the
will," interposed Emily,
whose love of truth did not enable her to conceal the weakness of her case.</p>
            <p>"Indeed! Is the will in the hands of a third party?" said the
attorney, with apparent
indifference, while, in reality, he was inwardly chuckling with delight.</p>
            <p>"It matters not," replied the doctor; "the lady's case is safe.
You can inform Mr. Dumont that
his niece will present herself in a week or ten days."</p>
            <pb n="228"/>
            <p>"But, my dear sir, the delay will be fatal, both to the lady and
her uncle," said the
attorney, with alarm.</p>
            <p>"It cannot be helped," said the doctor.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Dumont's health, I fear, will render it unsafe to wait so
long. Miss Dumont does not
wish her uncle to die unforgiven."</p>
            <p>"I will go, sir; I will go at once," exclaimed Emily, shocked at
the condition of Jaspar, and
anxious, as was her nature, to relieve the sufferings he must endure
in her absence. She forgot
how basely he had wronged her—how he had attempted her life;
the divine sentiment,
"Love your enemies," prevailed over every other consideration.</p>
            <p>"Die unforgiven," muttered the doctor. "Is he sick?"</p>
            <p>"He is, sir, and near his end."</p>
            <p>"Why have you not mentioned this circumstance before? It seems of
sufficient importance to
merit a passing word."</p>
            <p>"I wished not to distress the lady. I think I hinted that he was
in great distress."</p>
            <p>"I fear some evil, Miss Dumont."</p>
            <p>"Be assured, sir, if Mr. Dumont meditates any further wrong, he
has not the power of putting
it into effect. He is prostrate upon his bed, and if his niece does
not see him soon, it will be too
late, if it is not so already. The stricken man must soon stand for
judgment in another world,"
said De Guy, solemnly.</p>
            <p>"This alters the case," said the doctor, musing.</p>
            <p>"But, sir," continued the attorney, "I was aware that, after what
has happened, my mission
would be attended with many difficulties, and I have not come
unprepared to overcome them. I
do not wonder that you have no confidence,—I confess I should
not have, under like
circumstances. You know Dr. Le Verier?" and the attorney drew from
his pocket a bundle of
papers, and opening one, he glanced at the signature upon it, as he
pronounced the name.</p>
            <p>"I do, very well," replied the doctor.</p>
            <p>"Our family physician!" exclaimed Emily.</p>
            <pb n="229"/>
            <p>"Here, madam, is his certificate of your uncle's physical
condition," said De Guy,
handing her the paper.</p>
            <p>Emily read the paper, and handed it to the doctor.</p>
            <p>"Very satisfactory," said he; "you will pardon me for doubting
your word—"</p>
            <p>"Don't mention it, sir," replied De Guy, blandly. "I fully
appreciate your motive, and honor
you for it. And you know Mr. Faxon?"</p>
            <p>"O yes; what of him," said Emily, eagerly.</p>
            <p>"A letter from him," replied De Guy, giving her the missive.</p>
            <p>Emily hastily broke the seal, and, as she examined its contents,
the attorney appeared uneasy,
and watched her with a solicitude such as attorneys seldom manifest
in their clients, especially if
the pockets of the latter be empty.</p>
            <p>"I will go immediately!" exclaimed Emily, as she finished reading
the letter. "Mr. Faxon says
my Uncle Jaspar is quite a different man, and is ready to restore all
my rights."</p>
            <p>"Finally," said De Guy, "here is your uncle's own signature. This
letter I wrote by his
dictation, but he, with much difficulty, signed his name."</p>
            <p>Emily perused the paper, which was a promise that Jaspar would
restore all, and concluded
with an earnest request for her to return to Bellevue with all
possible haste. Emily recognized the
signature, though it was apparently written by the trembling hand of
a dying man.</p>
            <p>"The papers are quite satisfactory," said Dr. Vaudelier, as he
completed the reading of the
note from Jaspar. "If you had presented them at first, I should have
been spared my uncourteous
suspicions. But you will pardon them, and consider that the lady's
case requires the utmost
caution."</p>
            <p>"It was only in deference to the lady's nerves that I broke the
intelligence gradually. I was
quite willing to sacrifice myself, for the moment, in your good
opinion, for her sake. I trust you
will appreciate and regard my motives, as I do yours."</p>
            <pb n="230"/>
            <p>Henry Carroll, as may be supposed, was much against the plan of Emily's
returning to Bellevue with De Guy. But a death-bed scene was a
difficult thing to reason against,
and he was obliged to yield the point before the earnest eloquence of
Emily, and more calm
persuasions of Dr. Vaudelier.</p>
            <p>It was arranged that Hatchie should accompany her, and that the
party should take the
morning boat from Vicksburg.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was immediately summoned to receive instructions in
relation to their departure.</p>
            <p>At the mention of Hatchie's name, the attorney grew marvellously
uneasy, and suddenly
recollected that the negro who had conveyed him to the island was
waiting for him. He therefore
proposed that Dr. Vaudelier should escort Emily to Vicksburg in the
morning, which was readily
agreed to, and De Guy made a precipitate retreat, without confronting
the mulatto.</p>

            <p>AGREEABLY to the arrangement of the previous
night, Emily was on board of the "Montezuma," prepared to commence
her journey to Bellevue.
While De Guy conducted Emily to the ladies' cabin, Hatchie was
getting her few articles of
baggage on board, and the boat was fairly under weigh without the
faithful mulatto's having had
a sight of the new protector of Emily. The attorney congratulated
himself on this circumstance;
his mind had thus been released from the pressure of a most painful
anxiety. His plan was now
accomplished.</p>
            <p>But the meeting could not be much longer deferred. De Guy,
however, now that they were
free from the friends of Emily, no longer dreaded it.</p>
            <p>The dinner hour arrived, and Hatchie was standing by the side of
his mistress on the gallery,
when De Guy approached and announced the fact. His voice startled
Hatchie. It was the same
squeaking tone he had heard at Bellevue on the night of his escape.
He turned to look upon the
speaker, and was confounded to behold the very person who had plotted
with Jaspar on that
memorable night! With a presence of mind which never deserted him, he
held his peace, resolved
not to frighten his mistress by exposing the fact.</p>
            <pb n="232"/>
            <p>Hatchie stood lost in thought on the gallery long after De Guy had
conducted his
mistress to the dinner-table. The mulatto was in a quandary,—a
worse quandary than the
congressional hero of Kentucky has described in any of his thousand
relations of hair-breadth
escapes. His mistress was fairly committed to her new destiny, and
how could he extricate her?</p>
            <p>He resolved to do the only thing he possibly could do,—to
watch unceasingly, to be
ever ready to defend his mistress in case of necessity. The papers
which De Guy had brought
from Bellevue, and which he heard described by the doctor, did much
to assure him that no evil
was intended towards her; but the man who had been a villain once
was, in his opinion,
exceedingly apt to be so again.</p>
            <p>Emily was ill at ease during the passage; not that she felt
unsafe, or dreaded treachery, but
something seemed to whisper that evil <emph>might</emph> be near her.
An undefined
sensation of doubt seemed to beset her path, and urge upon her the
unpleasant necessity of
extreme caution. She was conscious of being engaged in a good work.
She had forgiven her great
enemy, and was now on her way to smooth his dying pillow. There was
something lofty and
beautiful in the thought, and she derived much consolation from it.</p>
            <p>De Guy rarely intruded himself upon her notice during the passage.
At meal-hours he was
scrupulously polite and attentive, but he was as cold and formal as
she could desire. She never
ventured upon the promenade deck, unless her faithful Hatchie was near.</p>
            <p>The mulatto, with all his watchfulness, was unable to discover any
indications of treachery
on the part of De Guy, though an apparently confidential conversation
with the captain of the
steamer, on the night before their arrival at New Orleans, had rather
an unfavorable appearance.</p>
            <p>It was late at night when the Montezuma arrived at New Orleans.
The steamer quietly took
her berth at the levee, so that few of the passengers took any notice
of their arrival,<pb n="233"/>
and contentedly turned over in their berths to wait the advent of the
coming day.</p>
            <p>Hatchie, who occupied a room near the boiler deck, had been
awakened by the confusion of
making fast the steamer. His watchful vigil over the safety of his
mistress did not permit him to
slumber while the possibility of danger existed. He had, therefore,
risen; but scarcely had he
completed his dress, when the door of his room was suddenly opened,
and himself violently
seized by two stout men. The attack had been so sudden, and the
movements of the assailants so
well directed, that resistance was hopeless. Before he fully realized
the presence of his foes, his
hands were pinioned behind him. In this condition, without knowing
why or by whom he was
assailed, he was hurried away to the calaboose.</p>
            <p>At an early hour in the morning carriages and drays began to
assemble on the levee, and all
the noise and bustle of landing passengers, baggage and freight, commenced.</p>
            <p>Emily Dumont, as soon as it was fairly light, rose from her couch,
and made her preparations
to leave the steamer. Fully equipped for her journey to Bellevue, she
entered the cabin, where De
Guy soon presented himself.</p>
            <p>"Where is Hatchie?" was the first question she asked; for Hatchie
had always been on the
spot whenever and wherever she needed his services.</p>
            <p>"I have taken the liberty to send him up to the St. Charles with
your luggage. You will, of
course, breakfast there," said the attorney, blandly.</p>
            <p>"Such was not my intention," replied she, as a cold
tremor—she knew not
why—agitated her.</p>
            <p>"I am sorry to have mistaken your purpose; the ride to Bellevue is
a long one to take without
any refreshment."</p>
            <p>"I mind it not; my haste is too great to admit of any delay."</p>
            <p>"I sent by your servant to order an early breakfast, and a
carriage at seven o'clock."</p>
            <pb n="234"/>
            <p>"Very well, I will conform to the arrangement you have made," replied Emily,
with a dissatisfied air.</p>
            <p>A carriage was called from the mass which had congregated, whose
drivers were not a whit
behind those of the metropolitan city in earnest perseverance; and De
Guy assisted her into it,
seating himself at a respectful distance on the forward seat.</p>
            <p>Now, the act of engaging a cab or a carriage is of itself quite an
easy matter; but we question
whether passengers are generally as well suited as in the present
instance. Without troubling the
worthy Mr. De Guy with any foolish queries as to where he should
drive them, the Jehu mounted
his box, and conducted his team apparently to the entire satisfaction
of his fare. It may be that the
intelligent driver had a way of divining the wishes of his customers;
or it may be that De Guy, in
deference to any supposed repugnance to business matters on the part
of his companion, had
previously discussed this topic. Without any design of prejudicing
the reader's mind in favor of
the latter supposition, we confess our inclination to accept it as correct.</p>
            <p>Emily vainly attempted to assure herself that her companion was
conducting her in good
faith to the home of her early years. An undefined feeling of
insecurity was painfully besetting
her, whichever way she turned. She considered and reconsidered the
evidences he had brought to
Cottage Island of the truth of his own statements, and of his own
trustworthiness. It was all in
vain. Could those papers have been forgeries? It was a terrible
thought to her.</p>
            <p>The carriage stopped, and the attorney invited her to alight.
Change—anything, was a
relief to the painful sensations which had almost overpowered her,
and without reflection she did
so. Her faculties were so confused she did not notice that it was not
the private entrance of the St.
Charles. She took everything for granted, and accepted the offered
arm of De Guy. She crossed
the broad side-walk, and, raising her eyes, was overwhelmed by seeing
at the side<pb n="235"/>
of the door she was about to enter the sign of "<hi>Anthony Maxwell,
Attorney and Counsellor at
Law.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"Please to walk up stairs," squeaked the attorney, drawing her
after him to the inside of the
door, which he immediately closed and bolted.</p>
            <p>"Not a step further, sir!" said she, with as much firmness as she
could command. "What
means this? Am I again betrayed?"</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay, madam, walk up quietly," said De Guy, in a soothing
tone, as he applied a little
gentle force to the arm he held.</p>
            <p>"Unhand me, sir!" screamed Emily, as loud as her agitated
condition would permit.</p>
            <p>But De Guy heeded her not; and, without condescending to utter
another word, he took her
up like a child, and bore her up the stairs to Maxwell's office.
Turning the key to prevent
interruption, he opened the lawyer's private apartment in the rear,
and placed the fainting girl
upon the bed, and retired.</p>
            <p>Unlocking the office door, he was confronted by an old negress,
who had charge of the
sweeping and cleaning department of the building.</p>
            <p>"Sar! what's all dis about?" screamed she, in no gentle tone; for
the colored lady had
witnessed De Guy's achievement from the stair-case above.</p>
            <p>"Hush, Dido—"</p>
            <p>"Sar! who are you dat come inter Massa Maxwell's room widout no leave?"</p>
            <p>"Never mind who I am, Dido. There is a lady in the bedroom, by
whom Mr. Maxwell sets his
life—do you hear?—sets his life. She has fainted, and you
must take care of
her,"—and De Guy slipped a half-eagle into the negress' hands.</p>
            <p>"Dat alters de case," said the black lady, eying the money with
much satisfaction. "Massa
Maxwell's a sly dog. I take good care ob de lady—not de fus
time, nuder."</p>
            <pb n="236"/>
            <p>"Don't let her get away; take good care of her, and you shall have
half a dozen just
such pieces."</p>
            <p>"Never fear, Massa, I's use to de business."</p>
            <p>De Guy left the building, satisfied, it would seem, of the
negress' fidelity.</p>

            <p>CONNECTED with the estate at Bellevue,
of which Jaspar Dumont was now in actual possession, was a small
slave jail. It had been
constructed under the immediate direction of Jaspar, to afford a
place of confinement for the
runaway or refractory negroes of the plantation. It was located at
some distance from the
proprietary mansion, and from the quarters of the negroes. Jaspar's
taste in matters of this kind
was of the most refined character, and he had caused it to be
constructed on a plan and in a
manner that would seem to bid defiance to the skill of a Baron
Trenck, or a Stephen Burroughs.
The material was granite, brought at no trifling expense from the
North. There were no windows
upon the sides, and only one entrance, which was secured by double
iron doors. Light and air
were supplied, in meagre quantities, by means of a skylight in the
roof, which was regulated by a
cord passing down upon the outside.</p>
            <p>This jail, either by accident or design, was so constructed that
any noise inside was not
transmitted to the outside. Whether this was because of the
reflecting properties of the walls,
which might have sent the sound echoing out at<pb n="238"/>
the skylight on the apex of the
four-sided roof, or because of some other natural causes, we shall
not take up the reader's time in
discussing. Its inmates might startle Heaven with their cries, but
certainly every ear on earth
below must be deaf to their wail. This circumstance seemed typical of
the actual fact of
oppression; but we are sure that Jaspar never meant to typify the
groans, by man unheeded, of the
victims of tyranny ascending to be heard above.</p>
            <p>It was the day after the events related in the last chapter, and
the negro jail was tenanted; but
not by a refractory or a runaway slave. It was now devoted to a more
dignified purpose, being
occupied by a white man and his wife, the victims of Jaspar Dumont's
hatred and fears. They had
already been prisoners for the past forty-eight hours. No sound from
the wide, wide world
without had reached them; and, though the man had shouted himself
hoarse in endeavors to arrest
the attention of any casual passer-by, the sound of his voice had
risen to Heaven, but had not
been heard by any mortal ear.</p>
            <p>On a heap of dirty straw, in one corner, lay a female. She was
feeble and helpless. By her
side, gazing sadly upon her, was her companion, pale and haggard, and
apparently conquered in
spirit. The sufferings of the frail being by his side seemed to
pierce him to the soul. He felt not
for himself; his thoughts, his feelings, all were devoted to her,
whom he had loved and respected
through many vicissitudes, whose kindly sympathy had cheered his
heart in many of the severest
of earth's trials. They had passed through peril and poverty
together, and now the cup of
tribulation seemed full to the brim. They were doomed to
death,—not to the death of the
malefactor, but as victims of private interest. No friendly jailer
had been near, to bring them even
a cup of cold water to assuage their consuming thirst. Not a morsel
of food had they tasted since
their incarceration! The terrible doom to which they were consigned
was too apparent; there was
nothing to foreshadow even the slightest hope of<pb n="239"/>
redemption. A few days' intercourse
with their inhuman persecutor had demonstrated too plainly that he
was equal to any crime which
his own safety demanded.</p>
            <p>The female turned uneasily upon her rude and filthy bed. Her
companion bent over her, and,
as a flood of tears poured from his sunken eyes, he imprinted a kiss
upon her pale cheek.</p>
            <p>"Do you feel no better, Delia?" asked he, tenderly.</p>
            <p>"Alas, no! The sands of life are fast ebbing out. O, for a single
drop of cold water!"</p>
            <p>"God in heaven! must I see her die, with no power to save?" exclaimed
Dalhousie,—for it was he,—striking his hands violently
upon his forehead.</p>
            <p>"Do not let me distress you, Francois! Let me die!—I am
ready to die," said she,
faintly.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie could make no reply. His emotions were too powerful to
permit his utterance.
Maddened by despair, into which the terrible situation of his
cherished wife had plunged him, he
paced the jail with long strides, gazing about him, as if to seek
some desperate remedy for his
woes. Escape had scarcely presented itself to his mind. He had not
the energy of character which
rises superior to every ill, and had bent himself supinely to the
fate which awaited him. To work
through the solid walls of the jail seemed to him an impossibility,
even if provided with the
necessary implements. The scheme was too vast for his mind,
unaccustomed, as it was, to
contend with great difficulties.</p>
            <p>Despair seemed to create, at this moment, a new man within him,
armed with energy to break
through every obstacle which might oppose him. His feeble, suffering
companion demanded an
effort for her relief, and such a demand even his supine nature could
not resist.</p>
            <p>Near one side of the jail was a shallow pit, which had,
apparently, been quite recently
excavated. In it lay the shovel with which the earth had been thrown out.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie fixed his eyes upon the pit. A new thought<pb n="240"/>
animated him. "I began to
dig that pit for gold; I will continue it for water," muttered he, as
he seized the shovel, and
commenced digging. Awhile he labored with the energy of desperation;
but, enfeebled by long
fasting, and unused to such severe toil, he soon felt his strength
give way. It appeared to be his
only hope, the only ministration of comfort to the loved one beside
him, and he strove manfully
against the weakness which beset him. An hour he labored; but not a
drop of moisture rewarded
his toil. Overcome by his exertions, he seated himself upon the brink
of the pit, and gave way to
the agonizing emotions which filled his soul. A sigh from his wife
roused him to a new effort,
and, partially invigorated by the few moments' rest, he again applied
himself to his task. The
ground was of a moist character, and he had every encouragement of
soon finding the coveted
treasure. Animated by this hope, he redoubled his efforts, and for
another hour despair nerved his
arm, and strengthened his sinking frame. Still the buried treasure
eluded his search. Exhausted by
his exertions, he sunk heavily upon the side of the pit, and the big
tears coursed down his hollow
cheeks. Deserted by man, he felt that there was no God in heaven; and
no divinely-born
sentiment came to cheer him in the hour of his despondency. He felt
that the hand of death must
soon take him and his loved wife into its cold embrace. With much
effort he drew himself to her
side, and endeavored to compose his mind for the struggle with the
destroyer.</p>
            <p>Two hours he lay by her side; but his time had not yet come.
Rested from the severe fatigue
he had undergone, he felt a new vigor stealing through his frame.
Something like hope again
flitted before his desponding mind, and, partially raising himself
from his recumbent posture, he
gazed about the apartment. The pit he had dug was yawning near him. A
shudder convulsed his
frame, as it reminded him of the open grave that gaped to receive
him. Had he not dug this grave
for himself?</p>
            <pb n="241"/>
            <p>The instinct of self-preservation drew him to his feet. Seizing
the shovel, he
advanced to the pit, when, to his unspeakable delight, he perceived
that the bottom of it was
covered with black, dirty water. The sight roused his dormant
energies, and he saw before him
years of life and happiness. Leaping into the pit, he drank from the
putrid pool, using the palms
of his hands for a drinking vessel.</p>
            <p>Tearing off the top of his glazed cap, he succeeded in making a
very tolerable cup of it, with
which he conveyed some of the precious liquid to the parched lips of
his sinking wife. The act
roused her from the absent mood to which she had abandoned herself.
She took a long draught of
the discolored beverage, and, had it been the pure mountain spring,
its effect could scarcely have
been more magical. It not only refreshed the body, but inspired the
mind. With this dawning
hope the poor prisoners built the flimsy fabric of future joy and safety.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie had lived years in the hours of his confinement.
Experience, the stern mentor of
humanity, had ministered to him, and imparted the strength and
resolution which often require
years to mature. Thoughts, and feelings, and energies, to which he
had before been a stranger,
came bounding through his mind, as the mighty river, which, having
broken away the feeble
barrier man had set in its course, roars and thunders down its before
forsaken path. The powerful
act impulse of hope, stimulated by this successful act, made him
curse his supineness in calmly
yielding to the awful fate which awaited him. His best
hours—his hours of unimpaired
strength—had now passed away; there was no fountain at which he
could renew it. But
energy now burned within him, and, like an invisible power, seemed to
drive him on to some
great act. The impulse was irresistible; hopeless as his case had
before appeared, he determined
to escape. But how? This question had not yet presented itself. Escape from the
jail!—from death!—himself,—more than himself, his
wife! Stone walls lost
their appalling<pb n="242"/>
firmness, and were no more than downy masses, which his breath
could blow away.</p>
            <p>Animated by this irresistible impulse, he took the shovel, and
sounded upon the walls; but
they were everywhere firm and solid beneath his blow. It seemed
useless to his usually inert
mind, and he was about to abandon himself again to the jaws of
despair, when a new thought
suggested itself. Fired with the inspiration of the new idea, he
impulsively proceeded to carry it
into execution. By the side of the wall, with vigorous strokes, he
commenced digging, with the
intention of undermining it. Without a thought of his enfeebled body,
he plied the shovel with the
energy of desperation. Instead of making a calm calculation, and
proceeding with such an
economy of strength as would enable him to complete the work, he
labored as though the task
before him could be easily and quickly accomplished.</p>
            <p>His wife, somewhat revived by the draught she had taken,
penetrated the purpose of her
husband; but she saw that his strength must entirely fail him ere the
work could be accomplished.</p>
            <p>"You must husband your strength, Francois," said she; "rest a little."</p>
            <p>"The hope of deliverance is too strong to let me sacrifice another
moment in idleness,"
replied Dalhousie, without ceasing from his labors.</p>
            <p>"But, Francois, you will kill yourself, if you work so hard."</p>
            <p>"That would be an honorable death, at least."</p>
            <p>"And leave me to linger here?—No, let us die together, if
die we must. Perhaps I can
help you,"—and she strove to rise.</p>
            <p>"Do not rise, Delia,—keep quiet; I am strong, and will yet
deliver you from this
dungeon. Lay quiet, dear; do not add to my distress."</p>
            <pb n="243"/>
            <p>"I fear I must lay still,—I cannot rise," said she, sinking
back with the
exhaustion of the effort.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie threw down his shovel, and hastened to her side.</p>
            <p>"Do not attempt to rise again, dear," said he. "Let me get you
some more water."</p>
            <p>He again filled the rude cup at the pit, and, after she had taken
a long draught of it, he laved
her head, an operation which appeared to refresh her.</p>
            <p>"Do you feel better?"</p>
            <p>"Much better."</p>
            <p>"Now keep perfectly quiet, and I will resume my task."</p>
            <p>"I will; but pray, Francois, do not work so hard; temper your
enthusiasm with reason. You
cannot succeed, unless you are careful."</p>
            <p>"I will, dear; I will rest every little while."</p>
            <p>Dalhousie resumed his labor, and, convinced by his wife's
reasoning, he labored more
moderately. While he toils at this apparently hopelessly task, we will
return to the night when we left him in the library, after having
obtained possession of the secret
packet.</p>
            <p>The overseer, after leaving the library, was perplexed to
determine his future course. He was
in possession of a mighty secret, a secret which involved his
employer's very existence. The
realization of a thousand golden dreams was at hand, and he was
resolved, without an over-nice
balancing of conscientious scruples, to make the most of the
information he had obtained. There
were two methods of procedure open to him, and his perplexity was
occasioned by this fact. In
this instance his resolution was not at fault, for the reins were in
his own hands. It was not like
hewing a path through the granite barriers of difficulty, against the
very frown of destiny. He
imagined that some overruling power had made the path, and invited
him to walk in it.</p>
            <p>Should he make his fortune by means of the uncle or the niece? The
question of his existence
had narrowed itself<pb n="244"/>
down to this point. It was sure, he felt, from one or the other.</p>
            <p>Being of a naturally generous disposition, with strong affections,
and having not a little of
the natural sense of justice in his composition, he was decidedly in
favor of permitting the niece
to enrich him. This was his personal preference; but he was sensible
of the truth of the axiom,
that individual preferences must sometimes be sacrificed to the
success of the main object; and, if
the circumstances demanded it, he felt able to make the sacrifice.</p>
            <p>If he forwarded the packet to its proper destination, the lady
would, without doubt, be soon
restored to her possessions. This was the course he preferred, as
well as the course which justice
and morality demanded. But, alas! his moral sentiment was not
sufficiently developed to make
him pause before taking the opposite course, if his present and
temporary interest should seem to
demand it. A departure from the strict injunction of conscience is
sure to bring misery; and this
was doubly true in his case.</p>
            <p>The uncle was in actual possession, and he called to mind the old
maxim, that "possession is
nine points in the law." He was unwilling to risk the bright
prospects, which had so suddenly
opened upon him, on the tenth point. Fearing that Jaspar's
unscrupulous character would enable
him to defeat the heiress, he had not the courage to do his duty and
trust Heaven for the reward.</p>
            <p>With this view of his position, he reluctantly—we will do
him the justice to say
reluctantly—abandoned the project of restoring the niece to her
birthright. Thus was the
great purpose of his life narrowed down to one point, and he retired
to his pillow to consider in
what manner he should approach Jaspar.</p>
            <p>Simple as this single point had before appeared, he found, on
reflection, that it was environed
with difficulties and dangers. Jaspar was intrenched in his own
castle, and it would require some
address even to approach near enough to hold a<pb n="245"/>
parley. Conclusive as were the
evidences in his possession of Jaspar's perfidy, they might, by the
aid of cunning and gold, be
made to appear as forgeries, gotten up for the purpose of extorting
money. The stake was a great
one, and he determined with a bold hand to play the game.</p>

            <p>JASPAR DUMONT, on the morning after
the abstraction of the papers by Dalhousie, rose from his inebriated
slumbers; but his rest was a
misnomer. The strong excitement, which a few weeks before had served
to keep his mind
occupied, had now passed away. His villany was accomplished; but it
had not purchased the
satisfaction be coveted—it had cost too much sacrifice of soul.
Brandy was his only
solace; and even this only conjured up demons of torture in his
fevered imagination.</p>
            <p>He was conscious that on the previous night he had drank too much.
There seemed to be a
chasm in his recollection which all his efforts could not fill. He
might, while in a measure
unconscious of his actions, have betrayed some of his momentous
secrets. The overseer, of
whose presence he had an indistinct remembrance, might have obtained
some further clue to the
great mystery. These were annoying reflections, and while he resolved
to be more temperate in
future, how fervently he adjured his patron demon to ward off any
danger he might have courted
in his inebriation!</p>
            <p>After his accustomed ride through the cane-fields, he retired to
the library. The decanter had
been replenished with brandy, and his late resolutions did not deter
him from freely imbibing of
its contents. The equilibrium was restored.<pb n="247"/>
His mind, stimulated by the fumes of the
liquor, resumed its usual buoyancy. He paced the room, and drank
frequent draughts of the fiery
beverage.</p>
            <p>Suddenly he stopped in his perambulation, as a faint recollection
of the lost key came to his
mind. He searched his pockets; but it could not be found. The drawer
was locked. Suspicious as
he was fearful, he trembled lest in his oblivious moments he had
compromised his secret. He sent
for the overseer, determined to know and provide for the worst.</p>
            <p>After the messenger left, his reflections assumed a new direction.
He tried to laugh away his
suspicions, applied epithets to himself which it would not have been
safe for another to have
applied, and in good round oaths cursed his own stupidity. In his
privacy he was a pattern of
candor, and bestowed upon himself such a rating as, to another, would
have given fair promise of
good results.</p>
            <p>He satisfied himself that the drawer could contain nothing to
implicate him; and, even if it
did, why, he was safe enough in the hands of Dalhousie. The overseer
he regarded as a kind of <emph>thing</emph>, who, while he retained
him in his service, would never injure him.
Jaspar, for some reason or other, had formed no very elevated opinion
of Dalhousie's acuteness.
He had bought him off cheaply once, and could do so again. If he
refused to be bought off
cheaply,—and Jaspar grated his teeth at the
reflection,—why, a method could be
devised to get rid of him.</p>
            <p>While engaged in these musings, a knock at the door startled him
to his feet. It was not the
overseer's knock.</p>
            <p>A servant announced a strange gentleman, who declined to give his name.</p>
            <p>"Show him in," said Jaspar, re-seating himself, and striving to
assume a tranquillity which
did not pervade his mind. Since the consummation of his base scheme
he had been a prey to
nervous starts, and the announcement of a stranger stirred the blood
in its channels, and sent his
heart into his throat. This nervous excitement had been increasing<pb n="248"/>
upon him every
day, and his devotion to the bottle by no means tended to allay it.
Such are the consequences of
guilt. If the victim, before he yields to temptation, could
anticipate the terrible state of suspense
into which his guilt would plunge him,—if he could see only a
faint reflection of himself,
starting at every sound in nervous terror, as before the appearance
of some grim spirit of
darkness,—he would never have the courage to commit a crime.</p>
            <p>The stranger entered the library. It was De Guy. At his appearance
Jaspar's fears gave way to
a most uncontrollable fit of passion.</p>
            <p>"Villain!" exclaimed he, "how dare you enter my house, after what
has passed?"</p>
            <p>"Gently, my dear sir! You forget that we have been friends, and
that our mutual safety
requires us to remain so still," said De Guy, in his silky tone and
compromising manner.</p>
            <p>Jaspar compressed his lips, and grated his teeth, while a
smothered oath escaped him. But his
rage soon found a more audible expression.</p>
            <p>"Friends!" By ——, I should think we had been
<emph>friends</emph>!" said
he, fiercely.</p>
            <p>"Certainly, my dear sir,—<emph>friends</emph>."</p>
            <p>"Then save me from my friends!"</p>
            <p>"Better say your enemies! I fear you have a great many."</p>
            <p>"Save me from both! May I ask to what fortunate circumstance I am
indebted for the honor
of this visit?" said Jaspar, sarcastically mimicking the silky tones
of the attorney.</p>
            <p>"I came to forward our mutual interest."</p>
            <p>"Then, by ——, you can take yourself off! You and I
will part company."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, sir, this is ungenerous, after I have assisted you into
your present position, to treat
me in this manner," replied the attorney, smilingly shaking his head.</p>
            <p>"I am <emph>not</emph> indebted to you for my life, or my position!<pb n="249"/>
You have
been a traitor, sir!—a traitor! and, tear out my heart, but I
will swing, before I have
anything further to do with you!" roared Jaspar, with compound
emphasis, as he rose from his
chair, and advanced to the brandy-bottle.</p>
            <p>"Gently, Mr. Dumont, gently! Do not get into a passion! May I ask
what you mean by
traitor? Have I not served you faithfully?" interrogated the
attorney, with a smile of assurance.</p>
            <p>"Served me faithfully!" sneered Jaspar. "You served me a cursed
shabby trick above Baton
Rouge, at the woodyard."</p>
            <p>"My <emph>dear</emph> sir, you wrong me! I did not injure you
bodily, I trust?"</p>
            <p>"No, sir! You have not that satisfaction."</p>
            <p>"I rejoice to hear it. All that I did was for your benefit,"
returned the attorney, complacently.</p>
            <p>"Do you take me for an idiot?"</p>
            <p>"By no means! You have shown your shrewdness too often to permit
such a supposition."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean, then?" said Jaspar, a little mollified, in
spite of himself, by the
conciliatory assurance of De Guy.</p>
            <p>"Simply that your interest demanded your absence. I had not the
time, then, to convince you
of the fact; and, I trust, you will pardon the little subterfuge I
adopted to promote your own
views."</p>
            <p>Jaspar opened his eyes, and fixed them in a broad stare upon his
companion.</p>
            <p>"Explain yourself," said he.</p>
            <p>"Everything has come out right,—has it not?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"You are in quiet possession?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"Then, sir, you may thank me for that little plan of mine at the
wood-yard. If I had not
prevented you from continuing your journey, all your hopes would have
been blasted."</p>
            <pb n="250"/>
            <p>"I do not understand you."</p>
            <p>"Where is your niece now?" asked the attorney, as a shade of
anxiety beclouded his brow.</p>
            <p>"She was lost in the explosion," replied Jaspar, with a calmness
with which few persons can
speak of the loss of near friends.</p>
            <p>The attorney was particularly glad at this particular moment to
ascertain that this, as he had
before suspected, was Jaspar's belief, and that this belief had
lulled him into security. He was not,
however, so candid as to give expression to his sentiments on the subject.</p>
            <p>"Precisely so!" exclaimed the attorney, as though no shade of
doubt or anxiety had crossed
him. "The Chalmetta exploded her boiler."</p>
            <p>"Well!"</p>
            <p>"Both Miss Dumont and her troublesome lover were lost,—were
they not?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"And, if you had continued on board, you would probably have
shared their fate."</p>
            <p>"Yes; but do you mean to say you blowed the steamer up?" asked
Jaspar, with a sneer.</p>
            <p>"Exactly so!"</p>
            <p>"Fool! do you expect me to believe such a miserable rigmarole as this?"</p>
            <p>"I hope you will, for it is strictly true," returned the attorney,
convincingly.</p>
            <p>Jaspar looked incredulous, and resorted to the brandy-bottle,
which seemed to bear the same
relation to him that the oracle of Delphi did to the ancient Greeks.</p>
            <p>"You do not think me capable of <emph>inventing</emph> such a
story, I trust," said De
Guy, seriously.</p>
            <p>"Ha! ha! ha! you have joined the church, haven't you, since we met
last?"</p>
            <p>"I see, sir, you think, because I assisted you in your plans, that
I have no honor, no
conscience, no humanity.<pb n="251"/>
Why, sir, what I have done for you was only a duty which
my religion demanded of me."</p>
            <p>"Your creed must be an original one!" replied Jaspar, with a
sickly laugh.</p>
            <p>"It <emph>is</emph> an original one. You thought yourself better
entitled to your brother's
property than this giddy girl. So did I; and it was my duty to see
justice done. A matter of
conscience with me, upon my honor."</p>
            <p>"Enough of this!" said Jaspar, sternly, for a joke soon grew stale
with him.</p>
            <p>"Be it so; but remember the story is true."</p>
            <p>"And you did me the favor to blow up the steamer!" sneered Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"At the risk of my own life, I did. I bribed the firemen to crowd
on the steam, and the
engineers to keep down the safety-valve,—all under the
excitement of a race, though with
special reference to your interest."</p>
            <p>"Was this part of your creed, too?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly," and the attorney launched out into a dissertation of
theology and kindred topics,
with which we will not trouble the reader.</p>
            <p>Jaspar heard it not, for he was busy in considerations of a less
metaphysical character. He
was thinking of his present position, and of the overseer, whose step
he heard on the veranda.</p>
            <p>"I see," said he, interrupting De Guy, "you have been my friend."</p>
            <p>This remark was the result of his deliberations. He might need the
services of the attorney.</p>
            <p>"I expect my overseer on business in a moment," continued he, "and
I should like to see you
again, after he has gone. May I trouble you to step into this room
for a few moments?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly," replied De Guy, who was congratulating himself on
his success in conciliating
the "bear of Bellevue," as he styled him among his boon companions.</p>
            <pb n="252"/>
            <p>Jaspar closed the door upon the attorney, and was in the act of
lighting a cigar,
when Dalhousie entered. The overseer endeavored to discover in the
countenance of his
employer some indications of his motive in sending for him; but
Jaspar maintained a perfect
indifference, which defeated his object. Neither spoke for several
moments; but at last the
overseer, embarrassed by the silence, said, "You sent for me, Mr. Dumont?"</p>
            <p>"I did," said Jaspar, suddenly, as though the words had roused him
from his profound
abstraction; "I did; one of my keys is missing, so that I cannot open
the drawer. You arranged its
contents, I believe."</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Dalhousie, flustered, for he was not so deeply skilled
in the arts of deception as
to carry them on without some compunction; "but I left the key in the
drawer."</p>
            <p>"You see it is not there," said Jaspar, fixing his sharp gray eye
upon the overseer.</p>
            <p>"It is not," said Dalhousie, advancing to the secretary. "Probably
it has fallen upon the
floor—" and he stooped down to look for it.</p>
            <p>Jaspar watched him in silence, as he felt about the floor. The
overseer was in no haste to find
it, though his eyes were fixed on it all the time.</p>
            <p>"Didn't you put it into your pocket, by mistake?" suggested Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Certainly not," replied Dalhousie; "here it is;" and, picking up
the key, he handed it to
Jaspar. "I was certain I left it here."</p>
            <p>Jaspar felt much relieved. "Sorry to have troubled you," said he,
but I wanted a
paper—" and he rose and opened the drawer, as if in quest of it.</p>
            <p>"No trouble at all," returned the overseer. "Now that I am here, a
few words with you would
be particularly agreeable to me."</p>
            <pb n="253"/>
            <p>Jaspar's curiosity was instantly excited, and, forgetting the
paper and De Guy, he
requested him to proceed immediately with his business.</p>
            <p>"It is a matter of much interest to both of us," continued
Dalhousie, embarrassed by the
difficulties of his position.</p>
            <p>"Well, sir, go on," said Jaspar, impatiently, for the overseer's
hesitation had rather a bad odor.</p>
            <p>"I may as well speak bluntly and to the point," stammered
Dalhousie, still reluctant to state
his business.</p>
            <p>"Why don't you? I am not a sentimental girl, that you need make a
long preface to your
oration."</p>
            <p>"I will, sir. Every man is in duty bound to consider his own
interest—"</p>
            <p>"Certainly, by all means. Go on."</p>
            <p>"In regard to your relations with your niece—" and Dalhousie
paused again.</p>
            <p>Jaspar's reddening face and the curl upon his lip indicated the
volcano of passion which
would soon burst within him.</p>
            <p>"Proceed, sir," said he, struggling to be calm.</p>
            <p>"In regard to your relations with your niece, you are aware that I
am somewhat acquainted
with them."</p>
            <p>"I am; I hope you do not know too much for your own good. You know
I am not to be trifled
with."</p>
            <p>"I am not concerned for my own safety," replied Dalhousie, a
little stung by the implied
threat of Jaspar; "but I wish to provide for your safety. I intend to
go to France."</p>
            <p>"I do not prevent you."</p>
            <p>"I lack the means."</p>
            <p>"And you wish me to furnish them?"</p>
            <p>"I do."</p>
            <p>"And how large a sum do you need?"</p>
            <p>"A pretty round sum. I will keep entirely away from this part of
the country, so that you need
not fear me."</p>
            <p>"Fear you!" sneered Jaspar, rising and draining a glass of brandy.
"I fear no man, no devil, no
angel!"</p>
            <pb n="254"/>
            <p>"Perhaps you are not aware that your reputation is in my hands."</p>
            <p>"Not at all, sir," said Jaspar, coldly.</p>
            <p>"Know, then, that I have a copy of the genuine will, and the means
of attesting it!"</p>
            <p>Jaspar was prepared for almost anything, but this was too much. He
paced the room with
redoubled energy. His bravado had vanished, and he was as near pale
as his bloated visage could
approach to that hue. He strode up and down the room in silence,
while his heart beat the reveille
of fear. For a time his wonted firmness forsook him, and he felt as
weak as a child, and sunk
back into a chair.</p>
            <p>By degrees he grew calmer. The case was a desperate one. Again he
swallowed a long
draught of brandy, which seemed to reduce his nerves to a state of
subjection. Gradually he
rallied the dissipated powers of his mind, and was ready to meet the
emergency before him.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie, after making his appalling announcement, had thrown
himself into a chair, to
await the effect of his words. He seemed in no hurry to continue the
subject. Thus far the effect
warranted his most sanguine hopes of the realization of his great schemes.</p>
            <p>Jaspar, after recovering some portion of his former calmness, said,</p>
            <p>"May I ask how you obtained possession of the document?"</p>
            <p>"That question, sir, I must decline answering."</p>
            <p>"You will, at least, show me the paper?"</p>
            <p>"That also I must decline."</p>
            <p>Jaspar bit his lip.</p>
            <p>"How shall I know, then, that you are not deceiving me?"</p>
            <p>"I assure you that I have the document, and you must trust to my
honor for the rest."</p>
            <p>"Honor!" exclaimed Jaspar, giving way to his passion. "No one but
a scoundrel ever talks of
his honor! By ——,<pb n="255"/>
I only want to hear that word, to know that the man
is a —— rascal!"</p>
            <p>"Very well, sir, I shall be under the necessity of seeking out
your niece."</p>
            <p>"My niece!" roared Jaspar, terror-stricken. "Did you not see her
buried at Vicksburg?"</p>
            <p>"It might have been she, but it is scarcely possible."</p>
            <p>"Hell!" shouted Jaspar, unable to govern his fury. With long
strides he paced the room, his
teeth grating like a madman's, and his eyes bloodshot and glaring
like those of a demon. His fears
seemed to arm him with desperate fury.</p>
            <p>"Where is the ring?—the ring!" said he, stopping in front of
the overseer. "Didn't you
give me her ring?"</p>
            <p>"I gave you a ring," said Dalhousie, calmly.</p>
            <p>"Was it not <emph>her</emph> ring? Did it not have her initial,
and her father's hair in it?"
and Jasper flew to the secretary, where he had deposited the evidence
of his niece's supposed
death.</p>
            <p>"There is no longer any need of continuing the deception—"</p>
            <p>"Deception! Here is the ring, and here is the letter D. Doesn't it
stand for Dumont?"</p>
            <p>"Not at all. It stands for Delia, my wife's name, in this instance."</p>
            <p>"Your wife's name!" exclaimed Jaspar, striking his forehead furiously.</p>
            <p>"It does, sir, and for her mother's name also, whose memory it was
intended to
commemorate."</p>
            <p>Jaspar's emotions were so violent, that the overseer began to fear
some fatal consequences
might ensue.</p>
            <p>"Calm yourself, Mr. Dumont. Do not let your passions overcome you.
I have no intention of
making an evil use of this information," said he, in a soothing tone.</p>
            <p>This seemed to calm the violence of Jaspar's feelings, and with a
strong effort he recovered
his command of himself.</p>
            <pb n="256"/>
            <p>"My niece is yet alive, is she?" said Jaspar, looking anxiously at
the overseer.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps not; but probably she is."</p>
            <p>"And it was not she that was buried?"</p>
            <p>"As to that, I cannot say; I never saw the lady alive."</p>
            <p>"And what are your plans?" asked Jaspar, with a glance of doubt at
the overseer.</p>
            <p>"I will go to France, if you provide the means."</p>
            <p>"Suppose I will not?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps your niece will."</p>
            <p>"What if she is dead?"</p>
            <p>"I can better tell when I know that she is dead."</p>
            <p>"How much money do you require?"</p>
            <p>"Twenty thousand."</p>
            <p>"A large sum."</p>
            <p>"From millions your niece would gladly give more."</p>
            <p>"I will think of your proposition. Come in again in two hours, and
you shall have my
answer."</p>
            <p>"Better give me an answer now."</p>
            <p>"I wish to consider."</p>
            <p>"You have only to choose between twenty thousand dollars and the
whole fortune. With your
means at command, much reflection is not needed."</p>
            <p>"Show me the papers, and I will decide at once."</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"Then I must consider whether your pretensions are well founded."</p>
            <p>"I will not be over nice; but any attempt to play me false shall
rest heavily on your own
head."</p>
            <p>"Honor!" said Jaspar, with something like a smile, but more like a
sneer.</p>
            <p>With compressed lips, and the scowl of a demon, Jaspar witnessed
the departure of the
overseer. His case looked desperate, and he felt something like the
gloominess of despair.
Dalhousie could be disposed of, but the niece!—the niece,<pb n="257"/>
if she yet lived,
would be the destruction of all his avaricious schemes.</p>
            <p>As usual when agitated, he paced the room; and, as he reflected
upon the danger, and the
desperate remedies which suggested themselves, his manner grew more
and more demoniacal.
He resolved to trust no man. This was a dark thought, and could
proceed only from the darkest
mind.</p>
            <p>The twenty thousand dollars he could pay; but the man who had such
a hold upon him would
never be satisfied while a dollar remained. And revenge was sweet!
No! Dalhousie must not be <emph>bought</emph> off! It was a feast to
his mind to anticipate the torture of the overseer!</p>
            <p>An exclamation of satisfaction escaped him, as he suddenly decided
upon the means of
torture. In imagination he could see before him <emph>the
thing</emph>, who had dared to
threaten him, lingering out the moments of a hated life in slow
agony. The vision was one of
pleasure, and he rubbed his hands with delight.</p>
            <p>The means of accomplishing his dark purpose then came up for
consideration, and in this
connection he happened to think of De Guy. He must be the minister of
his vengeance, and the
herald of his future safety; and he summoned him again to his presence.</p>

            <p>DE GUY returned to the library at Jaspar's summons.
The shrewd attorney at once perceived the conflict which agitated the
mind of his patron. He had
come to Bellevue with a purpose, and, as Jaspar's disturbed mind
seemed to favor that purpose,
he hailed it as an omen of success. But what had so agitated him?
Jaspar was not a man to be
depressed by any trivial circumstance.</p>
            <p>The attorney did not have to wait long in suspense, for Jaspar
related the particulars of his
interview with Dalhousie, and mentioned the price he had named to
insure his silence. It was
now De Guy's turn to be disturbed. The purpose for which he had come
was likely to be thwarted
by this new aspirant for a share in the Dumont estates.</p>
            <p>"What is to be done?" said Jaspar, in a tone which betrayed his
deep anxiety.</p>
            <p>"Get rid of him! His story is a fabrication," returned De Guy.</p>
            <p>"Not entirely. He knows too much for our safety."</p>
            <p>"So much the worse for him!"</p>
            <p>"Why? What would you do?"</p>
            <p>"Shut his mouth! It matters not how. You do not want to—"
and the attorney drew his
under lip beneath his upper teeth, and produced an explosive sound,
very much like the crack of a
pistol, or a champagne-cork, but which Jaspar did<pb n="259"/>
not mistake for the latter. "You do
not want to <emph>—f-h-t—</emph> him, if you can help it."</p>
            <p>"It would be the safest way," returned the other, not at all
embarrassed by the attorney's
ambiguous method of expressing himself.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps not; though 'dead men tell no tales,' it is also true
that 'murder will out.' Besides, I
have conscientious scruples."</p>
            <p>Jaspar sneered at this last remark; but the attorney was too
useful an adviser at that moment
to be lightly provoked, and he suppressed the angry exclamation which
rose to his lips.</p>
            <p>"How would the slave jail do?" said he, with a fiendish smile.</p>
            <p>"Too public. Our object is to save the man's life,—an act of
humanity; but we must
not endanger our own safety."</p>
            <p>"No mortal man can ever know that he is confined there. The jail
was built under my own
direction, and, owing to its peculiar construction, not even the
hands on the estate will know that
it is occupied. I always keep the keys myself."</p>
            <p>"If you are satisfied, it is enough. But how can you get him in?"</p>
            <p>"I can manage that, with your assistance," said Jaspar, who had
already arranged every
particular. "But his wife?"</p>
            <p>"His wife! Has he a wife?"</p>
            <p>"Ay; and one who, if I mistake not, will give us more trouble than
the fellow himself."</p>
            <p>"She must be caged with him."</p>
            <p>"You say well, Mr. De Guy. But can you reconcile this advice with
your dainty humanity?"
said Jaspar, with a sneer.</p>
            <p>"Certainly, I can! It were cruelty to separate man and wife, even
in death. If I had a wife, I
should be sorry to part with her under any circumstances."</p>
            <p>Jaspar grinned a sickly smile.</p>
            <p>"But the plan!" continued the attorney. "This loving couple will
not willingly occupy your
fancy apartment."</p>
            <pb n="260"/>
            <p>"Leave that to me. Go to the jail. Here are the keys. I will send
them to you.
When they are in, lock the doors!"</p>
            <p>De Guy smiled.</p>
            <p>"You do not understand me?"</p>
            <p>The attorney confessed that he did not.</p>
            <p>"Nevertheless, go to the jail, and wait their coming. Unlock the
doors; and get out of sight.
They will enter, like lambs."</p>
            <p>Jaspar explained a little further, and the attorney took his
departure to obey his instructions.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>At the time appointed, Dalhousie returned to receive Jaspar's reply.</p>
            <p>"You are punctual," said the latter.</p>
            <p>"I am," replied Dalhousie, cavalierly. "This business admits of no
delay. Are you prepared to
give me an answer?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," returned Jaspar, endeavoring to assume a crestfallen air.</p>
            <p>"Well, sir, do you accept my terms?"</p>
            <p>"I do, on one condition."</p>
            <p>"Name it."</p>
            <p>"It is, that you sign this bond never again to land in America,
and to preserve entire silence in
regard to the information you have obtained;" and Jaspar read an
instrument he had drawn up, to
blind the eyes of the overseer.</p>
            <p>"I agree to it."</p>
            <p>"It is well. But a further difficulty presents itself. I have not
so much money in the world.
The estate, perhaps you know, consists mostly of real estate, stocks,
negroes, &amp;c. I have not five
thousand dollars by me."</p>
            <p>The overseer looked at Jaspar with a keen, contemptuous glance, as
if to read any attempt on
his part to dupe him; but the wily planter moved not a muscle.</p>
            <p>"Then you cannot, if you would, consummate the bargain?" said he.</p>
            <pb n="261"/>
            <p>"I said not so," returned Jaspar. "I only remarked that a
difficulty had presented
itself."</p>
            <p>"Pray explain yourself."</p>
            <p>"The difficulty can be removed."</p>
            <p>"Well, how? What new risk must I run?"</p>
            <p>"No risk. To tell you all in a few words, I have the money in gold
buried on the estate."</p>
            <p>"That will suit me better. I prefer gold."</p>
            <p>"It is buried three feet under ground, in the slave jail. I
selected that place to bury it, because
I could dig without attracting attention."</p>
            <p>"It can easily be brought to light. An hour's work with the spade
will unearth it."</p>
            <p>"True; but I have not the strength to dig. Besides, I am engaged
with a friend in the next
room."</p>
            <p>Dalhousie accepted the excuse, for he had seen De Guy, as he was
walking in the garden,
half an hour before.</p>
            <p>"I can dig it up myself. Show me the spot."</p>
            <p>"Very well; but sign the bond first."</p>
            <p>"Of course, if you keep not your faith with me, the bond is
nothing," said Dalhousie, as he
affixed his signature to the paper, which Jaspar folded carefully,
and put in his pocket.</p>
            <p>"Here are directions which will enable you to find it without the
necessity of my attending
you;" and he handed him a slip of paper, upon which were written
minute directions to the
supposed locality of the treasure.</p>
            <p>"But, suppose," said Dalhousie, after he had read the directions,
"while I am digging, you
should close the doors upon me?"</p>
            <p>"Honor!" said Jaspar, laying his hand upon the place where the
heart belonged, with an
amusing contortion of the facial muscles.</p>
            <p>"I have not the highest confidence in <emph>your</emph> honor."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps not; but I can suggest a better protection. Have you any
person at hand upon whose
faith you can rely?"</p>
            <pb n="262"/>
            <p>"None but my wife," replied Dalhousie, carelessly, for the
mortifying fact seemed
laden with nothing of bitterness.</p>
            <p>"So much the better. She will be true. Station her at the door,
and, if she sees me approach,
you can be sure to be on the outside when I close the door."</p>
            <p>Jaspar's air of sincerity did as much to assure him as the fitness
of the plan suggested, and the
overseer determined to adopt it.</p>
            <p>Briefly he narrated to his wife—though with some variations
and concealments, for he
knew she would not endorse all his operations—the history of
the affair, and the good
fortune that awaited him; and requested her attendance at the jail,
to stand sentry over the gloomy
den, while he dug up the treasure.</p>
            <p>De Guy's patience was nearly exhausted when the overseer and his
wife made their
appearance. He had only time to conceal himself in a cane-field, when
the doomed couple
reached the jail. Dalhousie walked twice round it, before he ventured
to enter the building.
Stationing his wife at the door, he proceeded to measure out the
locality of the supposed treasure.</p>
            <p>De Guy watched them. For half an hour he remained quiet, when the
vigilance of the
lady-sentinel began to abate, and, by the exercise of extreme
caution, he succeeded in reaching,
undiscovered, the rear of the jail. Cat-like, he crept to the corner,
and listened. He could hear
their conversation. Carefully he stole round to the corner nearest to
the door. For an instant the
wife had left her station, to observe the progress of her husband's
labor. The time had come, and
the attorney was not the man to let the favorable moment pass
unimproved. With a rapidity
which seemed utterly incompatible with his rotund corporation, he
flew to the door, and sprung
the trap upon the hapless pair, in the midst of their vision of
wealth and happiness.</p>
            <p>Carefully locking the doors of the dungeon, he walked back to the
mansion as coolly as
though he had only impounded<pb n="263"/>
his neighbor's cow. Entering the library, he found
Jaspar impatiently waiting his return.</p>
            <p>"Are they safe?" said he.</p>
            <p>"As safe as your jail-walls can make them. Your plan was a clumsy
one, but I <emph>forced</emph> it to succeed."</p>
            <p>"Did they not enter without scruple?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, but the sentinel."</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! did you not know she would desert her post? If she saw not
danger, she would fear
none in the day-time,—it is woman-like."</p>
            <p>"Not always; but it matters not; they are safe. Now to business."</p>
            <p>"Business!" exclaimed Jaspar, with a start, and a wild stare at
the attorney. "The business is
done."</p>
            <p>"Not all of it. There are other enemies in the field."</p>
            <p>"What mean you?" said Jaspar, alarmed. "Are we not safe yet?"</p>
            <p>"Not quite," replied the smooth attorney, with a quiet smile. "The
game you played was a
deep one, and you must needs persevere to the end."</p>
            <p>"Explain yourself, man; don't trifle with me," said Jaspar, roused
by the smooth smile of the
attorney; for that smile seemed to him full of meaning.</p>
            <p>"All in good time, my dear sir. Let me beg of you not to be
discomposed by anything I may
say to you."</p>
            <p>Jaspar sneered, but ventured no reply.</p>
            <p>"I have served you faithfully, you must acknowledge."</p>
            <p>"I will acknowledge nothing," said Jaspar, testily.</p>
            <p>"The steamer exploded, you remember," returned De Guy, with an
expression of sly humor,
which Jaspar did not appreciate.</p>
            <p>"I do remember it, by Heaven! But this villanous Dalhousie says my
niece was not known to
have been killed."</p>
            <p>"Exactly so."</p>
            <p>"Sir! Do you mean to say that you <emph>know</emph> she was not lost?"</p>
            <pb n="264"/>
            <p>Precisely so."</p>
            <p>"By ——! Sir, you have been making a merit of this very
thing."</p>
            <p>"True, but policy, policy! You will recollect you were not in a
particularly amiable mood
when I had the honor to introduce myself this morning. It was
necessary to conciliate you, and
my plan succeeded admirably. Besides, I blowed up the steamer with
the intention of serving
you, and I ought to have the credit of my good intentions!"</p>
            <p>"And a pretty mess you have made of it!"</p>
            <p>"Did the best that could be done, under the circumstances."</p>
            <p>"The game is up! I may as well hang myself, at once."</p>
            <p>"The very worst thing you could possibly do. A long life of
happiness and usefulness is yet
before you, provided you follow my advice."</p>
            <p>"Your advice!" sneered Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"I shall have the pleasure of convincing you that my advice will
be the best that could
possibly be given to a man in your condition."</p>
            <p>"The girl is alive, is she?" muttered Jaspar, heedless of the
smooth words of his companion.</p>
            <p>"Alive and well; and, moreover, is close at hand."</p>
            <p>"The devil, she is! And you have been dallying around me all day
without opening your
mouth."</p>
            <p>"But remember, sir, you had another affair on your hands."</p>
            <p>"What avail to get that miserable overseer out of the way, when
the girl herself is at hand?"</p>
            <p>"One thing at a time. That excellent old man, Dr. Franklin, always
advised this method. The
overseer is safe; now turn we to other matters."</p>
            <p>"Well, what shall be done?" said Jaspar, rising suddenly and
paying his devoir to the
brandy-bottle.</p>
            <p>"I will tell you," replied the attorney, rising from his chair and
coolly imitating Jaspar's
example at the bottle. Then throwing himself lazily upon the
sofa—"I will tell<pb n="265"/>
you. The case is not desperate yet. How much is the amount of the old
colonel's property?"</p>
            <p>"How, sir! What mean you?"</p>
            <p>"Favor me with an answer," replied the attorney, with admirable
sang-froid, as he drew from his pocket
a cigar-case, and, taking therefrom a
cigar, proceeded to light it with a patent vesuvian. Politely
tendering the case to Jaspar, who
rudely declined the courtesy, he continued, "It is necessary to our
further progress that I have this
information."</p>
            <p>"Well, perhaps he was worth four or five hundred thousand. What
then?" replied Jaspar,
doggedly.</p>
            <p>"No more? Surely, you forget. His city property was worth more
than double that sum."</p>
            <p>"No more, by Heavens!" said Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Then, my dear sir, I fear you are a ruined man."</p>
            <p>"Sir!" and Jaspar started bolt upright.</p>
            <p>"See if you cannot think of something more," said De Guy, calmly.</p>
            <p>"He might possibly have left more."</p>
            <p>"Haven't you the schedule? Pray allow me to look at it;" and the
attorney rose and
approached the secretary. With the ease of one perfectly at home, and
acquainted with every
locality, he opened the drawer which contained the business papers of
the estate.</p>
            <p>"What are you about, sir? You are impudent!"</p>
            <p>"Not at all, sir. I wish to satisfy myself that the property is
worth more,"—and he
commenced fumbling over the contents of the drawer.</p>
            <p>"Take your hands out of that drawer, or I will blow your brains
out!" said Jaspar, fiercely, as
he seized a pistol from the table.</p>
            <p>"Very well," replied the attorney, closing the drawer; "you shall
have it as you will. I shall
bid you a good-day,"—and he prepared to depart.</p>
            <p>"Stay!" said Jaspar, replacing the pistol; "perhaps I<pb n="266"/>
can satisfy you, though I
cannot see what bearing it has upon the subject."</p>
            <p>"A very decided bearing, I should say," replied the attorney, not
at all disconcerted by what
had happened.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps if I had said a million, it were nearer the truth."</p>
            <p>"Not a bit. You are still half a million out of the way, at least.
Is it not a million and a half?"</p>
            <p>"It may be," said Jaspar, hesitating.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps two millions."</p>
            <p>"No," said Jaspar, decidedly.</p>
            <p>"I suspected two was about the figure, but we will call it a
million and a half."</p>
            <p>"Well, what then?" said Jaspar, impatiently.</p>
            <p>"One-half of it would be a very pretty fortune," soliloquized De
Guy, loud enough to be
heard by his companion.</p>
            <p>"No doubt of it," replied Jaspar, with a ghastly smile, which
betrayed but little of the terrible
agitation that racked him, as he heard these words.</p>
            <p>"But, Mr. Dumont, you are not a married man, you know, and
one-third of it would be very
handsome for you."</p>
            <p>"Very comfortable, indeed; and, no doubt, I ought to be very
grateful to you for allowing me
so much."</p>
            <p>"Exactly so. Gratitude is a sentiment worthy of cherishing. The
fact is, Mr. Dumont, I intend
to marry; and, for a man of my expensive habits, one-half is hardly
an adequate share. You are a
single man, and not likely to change your condition at present, so
that you can have no possible
use, either for yourself or for your heirs, for any more than one-third."</p>
            <p>"Your calculations are excellent!" said Jaspar, with a withering
sneer. "But suppose I should
grumble at your taking the lion's share?"</p>
            <p>"O, but, my dear sir, you will not grumble! Your sense of justice
will enable you to perceive
the equity of this division."</p>
            <pb n="267"/>
            <p>"Enough of this! I am in no humor for jesting," said Jaspar, with
a frown.</p>
            <p>"Jesting!" exclaimed the attorney, with a well-made gesture of
astonishment; "I was never
more in earnest in my life."</p>
            <p>"May I be allowed to inquire the name of your intended bride?"
sneered Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"A very proper question; and, considering our intimate friendship,
a very natural one.
Although my intention is a profound secret, and one I should not like
to have go abroad at
present, especially as her nearest of kin might possibly object,
still I shall venture to inform <emph>you</emph>, since you are to
have the honor of providing the means of carrying my
matrimonial designs into effect."</p>
            <p>"I am certainly under obligations for your favorable
consideration. But the lady's name?"</p>
            <p>"Miss Emily Dumont! a beautiful creature—high-spirited—every way
worthy—"</p>
            <p>"Damnation! this is too much," growled Jaspar, fiercely, as he
seized the pistol which lay
near him, and levelled it at De Guy. "You curbed villain! You and I
must cry quits!"</p>
            <p>"Do not miss your aim!" coolly returned the attorney, drawing from
his pocket a revolver.
"Miss not your aim, or the fortune is <emph>all</emph> mine."</p>
            <p>Jaspar was overcome by the coolness of De Guy, and, throwing down
the pistol, he sank
back into his chair, overpowered by the violence of his emotions.</p>
            <p>"De Guy!" said he; "fiend! devil! you were born to torment me.
There is no hotter hell than
thine! Do thy work. I must bear all,"—and Jaspar felt that he
was sold to the fiend before
him.</p>
            <p>"My dear sir, do not distress yourself," replied the attorney,
resuming his supercilious
manner, which he had laid aside in the moment of peril. "I offer you
the means of safety. You
will escape all the dangers that lower over you<pb n="268"/>
by my plan, which, I am glad to see,
you perfectly understand."</p>
            <p>"And lose the price for which I sold my soul? Even Judas had his
forty pieces of
silver—the more fool he, to throw them away! I could not do
this thing, if I would. My
soul is bound to my money."</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! do not let avarice be your besetting sin. It is a vice too
mean for your noble nature."</p>
            <p>Jaspar tried to sneer again, but the muscles refused to perform
their office. He stood like a
convicted demon before his sulphurous master.</p>
            <p>"It must be done," said De Guy; "there is no other way."</p>
            <p>Jaspar heard the words, and struggled to avoid the conclusion
towards which they pointed.
The demon bade him yield, and the command was imperative. He could
not resist—his
will was gone.</p>
            <p>"What are the details of your plan?" gasped he, faintly.</p>
            <p>"Marry the lady, and take up my abode in this mansion," replied
the attorney, promptly.</p>
            <p>"And turn me out of doors! Well, be it so. I must do as you will."</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay, my dear sir; you wrong me. You shall still be the
honored inmate of our
dwelling,—the affectionate uncle of your Emily, as of old,"
said the attorney, with infinite
good humor.</p>
            <p>Jaspar had well-nigh recovered his self-possession under the
stroke of this, to him, severe
satire; but De Guy gave him no time.</p>
            <p>"We must proceed in some haste," continued the attorney, seizing a
pen, and writing as he
spoke. "My time is short, and I have already been somewhat lavish of
it. Here, sign this paper; it
is your consent to my union with your niece. Call some one to witness it."</p>
            <p>Jaspar signed the certificate, without reading it. A witness was
called, and the paper in due
form was deposited in De Guy's pocket.</p>
            <pb n="269"/>
            <p>"Now, sir, the lady is not altogether willing to consent to this
arrangement; but
you must persuade her, and, if need be, compel her, to consent. She
will be here in a few days.
After the marriage, it will only remain for me to make over to you
one-third of the property,
which, as her husband, I can then legally do. Be firm, and behave
like a man, and your troubles
are ended. Everything will be hushed up, and you can spend the
evening of your days in peace
and quiet. I bid you good-day."</p>
            <p>The attorney formally and politely ushered himself out of the
library, and took his departure
for New Orleans.</p>

            <p>WE left Dalhousie engaged in the seemingly
hopeless task of undermining the wall of the slave jail, at which he
labored for several hours,
resting at intervals, as his exhausted frame demanded. The prospect
of realizing his hope
encouraged him, and lent an artificial strength to his arm. He had
already excavated a pit several
feet in depth, but had not reached the bottom of the foundation wall.
The quantity of earth piled
upon the brink of the pit required extra exertion to remove it, but
he toiled on with the energy of
despair.</p>
            <p>After laboring several hours more, he discovered, to his great
joy, the bottom of the
foundation. Again he plied the spade, and, by almost superhuman
exertions, he succeeded in
excavating a hole under the stones, which, below the surface of the
ground, were not laid in
mortar. After loosening all the small stones around a larger one, he
found that he could pry it out,
which, with much labor, he accomplished. The removal of the other
stones was comparatively an
easy task, and a little time sufficed to clear a space up to the
solid masonry.</p>
            <p>But here a new difficulty presented itself. The hole he had dug
was already half filled with
the stones he had tumbled from their positions. His strength was not
sufficient to remove them,
and he was compelled to dig again, in order to prosecute his labors.</p>
            <p>The wall removed, he commenced digging outside of the<pb n="271"/>
foundation wall.
Patiently he dug down to obtain sufficient room for the deposit of
earth from the outside. Slowly
and laboriously he undermined the ground, till the surface above him
caved in, and—joy
to his panting soul!—the air, the pure air of heaven, rushed in
through the aperture!
Hastily enlarging the cavity, and removing the earth to the inside,
he ascended to the surface of
the ground. A feeling of gratitude thrilled through his frame, as he
once more inhaled the free air
of heaven, that he had escaped the terrible fate which a few hours
before had seemed inevitable.</p>
            <p>With faltering step,—for now that his Herculean task was
accomplished, the reality of
his weakened physical condition was painfully apparent,—he
walked round the jail, to
satisfy himself that no one was in the vicinity. The sun was set, and
the shades of night were
gathering upon the earth. The time was favorable for his escape.
Having satisfied himself that he
was unobserved, he hastened to the garden, which was close at hand,
to procure the means of
invigorating his own body, and restoring to life and animation the
partner of his captivity. Fruit
of various kinds—melons, figs—rewarded his anxious
search. Filling his
handkerchief with cantelopes and figs, he hastened back to the jail,
with all the speed his weary
limbs would permit. His thoughts were fixed upon his wife, whose
suffering had pierced his soul
more deeply than all the anxiety and doubt he had experienced on his
own account. As he
tottered along, he asked himself if he should eat of the fruit he
carried ere she had tasted of the
banquet. He drew one of the rosy-cheeked, juicy figs from the
handkerchief. It was no loss of
time—no deferring of the succor she needed—to eat as he
walked; run he could not,
though he fain would have quickened his tardy pace. It would restore
his strength, and enable
him the better to protect and rescue her. It was not wrong, though,
from the deep well of his
affection, came up something like a reproach for his selfishness. He
ate the fruit. The effect was,
or seemed to be,<pb n="272"/>
magical. He thought he could feel it imparting strength to his
exhausted form. Again he ate, and in the pleasant sensation to his
unsated palate, his imagination,
as much as the fruit, nerved his muscles, and he walked with a firmer step.</p>
            <p>He had not completed one-half the distance back, when he
discovered two men in the
vicinity of the jail. A cold shudder nearly paralyzed him. Was his
labor all in vain? Had he with
so much trial and suffering effected his escape, only to be
incarcerated again? The thought was
maddening, and he resolved to die rather than be returned to the dungeon.</p>
            <p>Drawing a revolver from his pocket, with which he had prudently
prepared himself before
his interview with Jaspar, he proceeded on his way.</p>
            <p>On a nearer approach, the men appeared to be strangers to him.
They might, however, be in
the employ of Jaspar. They might be engaged in watching over his captivity.</p>
            <p>He approached nearer. He had never seen either of them before.
They did not look like men
whom Jaspar would have been likely to select for such a purpose as he
apprehended. Still, he
took the precaution to examine the caps upon his pistol, and have his
bowie-knife in a convenient
place for immediate use.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie was the first to speak.</p>
            <p>"Your business here?" demanded he, regardless of the courtesy to
which he had been all his
life accustomed.</p>
            <p>"The fact on 't is," replied one of the strangers, a little
startled by the rude manner of
Dalhousie, "the fact on 't is, we are lookin' arter the mansion of a
Mr. Dumont. Perhaps you will
oblige us by tellin' us which way to go."</p>
            <p>"He lives in yonder house," replied Dalhousie, pointing it out.</p>
            <p>The simplicity of the speaker dissipated his apprehensions, and
his curiosity was excited.</p>
            <p>"You know him, do you?" continued he.</p>
            <pb n="273"/>
            <p>"Well, no—I can't say I do."</p>
            <p>"But you have business with him?"</p>
            <p>"Not particularly with him,—the Lord forbid!" replied the
stranger, devoutly.</p>
            <p>"Devil a bit with him, at all," added his companion.</p>
            <p>"Since no one else resides under the same roof with him, may I ask
the reason of your visit
there, if I am not too bold?" said Dalhousie.</p>
            <p>"Sure, it 's only to see the counthry, about here, we've come,"
replied the Irish stranger.</p>
            <p>"No, Partrick, you know that is not the truth. Never tell a lie
for anything, Partrick. Our
business an't with him, but it consarns him. We don't care about
mentioning it to everybody."</p>
            <p>"I do not mean to be impertinent," said Dalhousie; "but perhaps I
may be able to serve you.
The man you seek is a villain!"</p>
            <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Uncle Nathan,—for we presume it
is unnecessary to <emph>tell</emph> the reader that it was
he,—"I know <emph>that</emph>."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, then you have some knowledge of him?"</p>
            <p>"Sartain! but do you know a minister in these parts by the name of
Faxon?"</p>
            <p>"I do; he lives close by."</p>
            <p>"Do you belong in this part of this country, Mister?" asked Uncle
Nathan, who seemed to
make the question a prelude to other inquiries.</p>
            <p>"I do. But I must leave you now. I am the bearer of life to one
whom I love dearer than
myself. I have been foully wronged by the man you visit."</p>
            <p>"Heavens and airth! you don't say so?" exclaimed Uncle Nathan.</p>
            <p>"Doomed to a death by starvation, with my wife, in yonder jail, by
his malice, I have just
effected my escape. My wife is nearly dead, but I hope to restore her
with these fruits."</p>
            <pb n="274"/>
            <p>"Good Heavens! who would have thought there was such a monster upon the
airth?"</p>
            <p>"By the powers!" ejaculated Pat Fegan.</p>
            <p>"Can't we help you?" asked Uncle Nathan.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you can. I thank you, and, if it is not too late, she
also will thank you. My strength
is nearly gone."</p>
            <p>Dalhousie, followed by Uncle Nathan and Pat Fegan, proceeded
towards the jail, the former
relating, as they went, the terrible incidents of their captivity,
and the means by which he had
effected their happy deliverance.</p>
            <p>On the night of the explosion of the Chalmetta's boiler, Uncle
Nathan and Pat Fegan had
saved their lives by jumping overboard, and had been picked up by the
Flatfoot. The true-hearted
New Englander had made a diligent search for the parties who had
intrusted the will in his
keeping, but without success. He had been enabled to gain no tidings
of any of them, and was
now continuing his search to the mansion of the Dumont family.</p>
            <p>The party reached the jail, and Dalhousie leaped into the pit,
followed by his companions.
The poor wife seemed to have no realization of the event which had
set them free, and gazed
with a wild stare upon her husband and those who accompanied him.</p>
            <p>"We are safe, Delia! we are safe!" said Dalhousie, as he proceeded
to untie the bundle of
fruit.</p>
            <p>"Safe! no, it cannot be—only a dream! But who are these persons?"</p>
            <p>"They are friends, Delia—friends who have come to help me in
saving you. Take one
of these figs, dear. They will restore you."</p>
            <p>"Figs!" replied Delia, with a vacant look.</p>
            <p>"Yes, dearest; taste it,"—and he placed the fruit, which he
had divested of its rind, to
her lips.</p>
            <p>The act seemed to restore her wandering mind to its equilibrium,
and she painfully lifted
herself on the pallet of straw, and took the fruit in her hand. She
gazed upon it<pb n="275"/>
with a
kind of silent rapture, while a faint smile rested upon her pallid lips.</p>
            <p>"We are indeed safe, if you have found food,"—and she tasted
the fig.</p>
            <p>"Eat it all, dear; here are plenty more, and melons, too."</p>
            <p>"Let me see you eat, Francois; it will do me more good than to eat
myself. You have labored
hard. Can we get out of this place? Are not these Mr. Dumont's
friends? Have they come to fill
up the pit you have dug?"</p>
            <p>"No, dearest, they are <emph>our</emph> friends," said Dalhousie,
pained by the
wandering, wild state of her mind, and fearful that it might end in
insanity. "We will leave this
place as soon as you have eaten some of these figs and melons. I am
almost restored by the joy of
this moment, dearest; and you must strive to be of good cheer."</p>
            <p>Dalhousie and his wife ate freely of the fruit, while Uncle Nathan
and Pat gazed in silence
upon the scene. But Delia was not so easily restored. Her mental and
physical sufferings
appeared to have given her constitution a shock from which it would
take time to recover.</p>
            <p>A conference took place between the parties, to decide upon the
best means of removing the
lady, who was utterly incapable of moving a step, and scarcely of
lifting her form on her rude
couch. Uncle Nathan was not long in devising a method; and, directing
Pat to enlarge the
aperture through which the captives were to escape, he went in search
of some canes, with which
to construct a litter. Pat applied himself vigorously to his task,
tumbling over the huge stones like
playthings, and handling the shovel with all that dexterity for which
the Celtic race is so
distinguished.</p>
            <p>A rude litter was constructed, on which were laid the coats of the
party, so as to render it as
comfortable as possible to the sufferer. Uncle Nathan and Dalhousie,
with much tenderness,
though not without pain to the invalid, succeeded in<pb n="276"/>
getting her through the aperture
into the open air, where she was placed upon the litter.</p>
            <p>It was decided to carry her to the house of Mr. Faxon, upon whose
active sympathies they
relied for shelter and assistance; and they went with the more
confidence, because Uncle Nathan
had heard from Emily the interest he took in her affairs. The litter
was borne by Uncle Nathan
and Pat, while Dalhousie walked by its side, to cheer the heart of
his wife by promises of future
joy, which the uncertain future might never redeem.</p>
            <p>Mr. Faxon received the party with scarcely an inquiry as to the
nature of the misfortune
which brought them to his door. There was a person in distress, and
this was all his great,
sympathetic heart needed to bid him open wide his doors.</p>
            <p>Delia Dalhousie was placed upon a bed, a negro was despatched for
a physician, and every
effort used to alleviate her physical and mental sufferings.</p>
            <p>After the wants of the sufferers had been supplied, Mr. Faxon
listened with horror and
indignation to the tale of Dalhousie's confinement, and the causes
which led to it; for the overseer
was so candid as to relate all, not even omitting the bribe he had
agreed to take of Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"It is thus, Mr. Dalhousie, that our plans are defeated, when they
are unworthy," said he. "Let
this be a lesson to you for the future. Never do or countenance a
wrong action, and, whatever
befalls you in this changing world, you will have an approving
conscience to smile upon you,
and lighten the darkest hour of adversity. But your tale brings me
consolation. There is yet hope
that Miss Dumont is alive. The cruel story of her death has darkened
the abode of many a warm
heart, even in spite of the reflection that she was a slave. She was
a true woman, and I pray that
God may spare her yet many years to bless the needy and the unfortunate."</p>
            <p>Dalhousie felt the full weight of Mr. Faxon's rebuke, and<pb n="277"/>
acknowledged the
justice of the punishment he had received. Uncle Nathan heard with
astonishment the wickedness
of which the uncle of Emily had been guilty, and his simple New
England heart was sorely
perplexed by it. He had no "idea" of such depravity, and he was
tempted, even in spite of the
Scripture injunction to the contrary, to "thank God that he was not
like other men."</p>
            <p>In the course of the conversation to which the incidents of the
evening had given rise, the
honest farmer found an opportunity to broach the subject of his
mission; and the time was
occupied, until a late hour, in discussing the means of doing justice
to the injured, in restoring to
Bellevue its rightful mistress.</p>

            <p>EMILY DUMONT remained a close
prisoner in the rear apartment of Maxwell's office. Dido, the old
negress, was her only attendant
during her incarceration; for, though the room was supplied with
every luxury the most
pampered appetite could desire, her confinement deserved no better
name. She recognized the
place, and doubted not she should be again subjected to the infamous
persecution of her old
enemy. She wondered that he had not already presented himself, and
concluded he could not yet
have returned from his up-river journey, or he would have done so. No
one visited her but the
negress, whose conversation, in her eagerness to serve the liberal
proprietor of the office, was
disgusting to her refined sensibilities. Not even De Guy came, to
give her any intimation of the
nature of the fate which awaited her.</p>
            <p>Maxwell's mind, she was satisfied, was fixed upon the possession
of her estates. She could
not now entertain the belief which once, in her weak pity, she had
countenanced, that the attorney
could <emph>love</emph> her. O, no! God forbid that even the human
heart can love, and, at
the same time, persecute the object of its affections! It was her
estates; and she half resolved to
compromise with her tormentor by yielding him one-half of her
property, on the condition of his
restoring the other half, for she doubted not that he was able to do
so. But there was something so
debasing to her sentiment of<pb n="279"/>
truth and justice in the fact of bargaining with so base a
man, that she could not conquer her prejudice, and finally determined
to suffer everything rather
than succumb to the villain.</p>
            <p>Hope had not yet abandoned her. She had too much confidence in the
omnipresent justice of
an overruling Providence to doubt that all would yet end well.</p>
            <p>Dido was her jailer, and she scarcely left the office, through
which alone egress was had
from the apartment of Emily. There she dozed away the day and night,
freely indulging in the
fashionable habit of "imbibing," to chase away the ennui of the
heavy hours. Her liberal perquisites enabled her to gratify her
appetite without stint or measure,
though a sort of demi-consciousness of her responsibility deterred
her from an entire
abandonment to the pleasures of the cup.</p>
            <p>The apartment in which Emily was confined was lighted by windows
of stained glass,
opening into the main office, so that there was no immediate
connection with the open air. This
fact rendered the room so secure that Dido rested perfectly easy from
the fear of interruption,
save from the front of the building.</p>
            <p>The colored guardian, having imbibed rather inordinately one day,
was disposed to court the
favor of the sleepy god, and stretched herself at full length upon
one of the easy lounges of the
office. Her eyelids opened and closed languidly, as though she was
about to sink away into
dreamy unconsciousness, when she was startled by a loud knocking at
the door.</p>
            <p>"Who's dar?" shouted Dido, springing to her feet; for a visit to
the office, at this season of the
year, was of rare occurrence.</p>
            <p>"Open the door, Max," responded a voice from the outside.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Maxwell not here, sar," said the colored lady, partly opening
the door.</p>
            <p>"Not here!" returned the visitor, pushing into the office<pb n="280"/>
in spite of the negress,
who was disposed to prevent his entrance. "Isn't Max in town?"</p>
            <p>"No sar; he went away to de Norf about a monf ago."</p>
            <p>"Look here, you black imp," said the stranger, in a severe tone,
"do you mean to say that
Max is <emph>not</emph> in town?"</p>
            <p>"I do, for sartin, sar."</p>
            <p>"And he has left you to practise law for him in his absence?"
returned the visitor, with a grin.</p>
            <p>"No sar, I takes care ob de buildin."</p>
            <p>"Fudge! Maxwell always shuts up his room when he leaves town;" and
the stranger walked
round the room towards the private apartment, much to the
consternation of Dido.</p>
            <p>"No, Massa, he tell me, monf ago, to keep de room in order."</p>
            <p>"No doubt he did," returned the stranger, placing his hand on the
handle of the door, and
attempting to open it, which, by Dido's precaution, was ineffectual.</p>
            <p>"Is there no one in this room?" asked the gentleman.</p>
            <p>"No sar, de room is locked, and Massa Maxwell hab carry off de key."</p>
            <p>The stranger walked several times round the room, and thoroughly
scrutinized everything;
after which, to the entire satisfaction of the colored lady, he took
his departure. Passing out of the
building, he crossed the street and entered a coffee-room, at the
front window of which he seated
himself, as if with the intention of watching Maxwell's office.</p>
            <p>This person was the reader's old acquaintance, Vernon,—or,
more properly, Jerome
Vaudelier, whose intervening history we are now called upon to
relate. It will be remembered
that, at the request of his father, and at the earnest desire of
Henry Carroll, as well as by the
promptings of his own wish to do justice to the heiress, he had gone
to Vicksburg, for the
purpose of keeping an eye on the movements of Maxwell. On his arrival
at the hotel, he found
the attorney, and dined with him; but after dinner he suddenly and
<orig>mys-</orig>
               <pb n="281"/>
teriously disappeared. All Vernon's inquiries were of no avail. The landlord
said he had paid his bill, and that was the last he had seen of him.
Vernon was perplexed, and on
learning that no boat had left since dinner, he was at a loss which
way to proceed. Late in the
afternoon he obtained, as he thought, some clue to him; and he
departed, without loss of time, to
Jackson, whither the attorney was supposed to have gone. His search,
however, was futile, and he
returned to Vicksburg by the morning train. Much disheartened, he was
compelled to go to
Cottage Island with the intelligence that his efforts had been
foiled. On his arrival, he learned, to
his astonishment, that Emily had just gone to Bellevue in company
with De Guy—a
person of whom he had no knowledge.</p>
            <p>Though Dr. Vaudelier and Henry Carroll had been satisfied with the
evidences brought by
De Guy, Vernon was not. He knew better than they the character of
Maxwell, and it was
determined that he should proceed immediately to New Orleans, to
guard against the possibility
of any evil to which Emily might be subjected.</p>
            <p>On the morning after De Guy's departure, he proceeded down the
river, and landed in the
vicinity of Bellevue, to which he immediately made his way. Without a
direct application to any
one, he learned that Emily had not yet arrived. He waited in the
vicinity another day, but
obtained no tidings of her. His worst fears were now confirmed. De
Guy had deceived them.</p>
            <p>This De Guy, then, was an emissary of Maxwell. To his mind, now
animated by a high
purpose, the reflection was annoying. To the fate of Emily his new
destiny seemed to be
attached. His greatest error—at least, the one most troublesome
to his awakened
conscience—was the act of oppressing Emily. He felt that the
washing of the stains from
his character depended upon securing her rights.</p>
            <p>The ci devant desperado, as we have
before indicated, was
radically changed at heart, and he now felt more interest in<pb n="282"/>
the welfare of Emily than
he had ever before harbored for any human being.</p>
            <p>His position was full of embarrassments. He learned, while at
Bellevue, that Jaspar was not,
and had not been, sick. This information decided his future course.
The mission of De Guy had
only been a decoy, to lure her into the hands of Maxwell.</p>
            <p>Hatchie was with her; but, alas! what could a slave do against the
powerful machinations of
such a villain as Maxwell?</p>
            <p>After obtaining the information which satisfied him of the
imposture, he proceeded to New
Orleans. Knowing the name of the steamer in which De Guy had taken
passage from Vicksburg,
he hastened to the levee, to gain what tidings he might from the
officers of the Montezuma. He
found that a lady and gentleman answering to his description had
taken a carriage on the morning
of their arrival, and this was all they knew. In answer to his
inquiries for Hatchie, he learned that
a servant had been handed over to the police, to be imprisoned in the
calaboose till called for.</p>
            <p>This was scanty information upon which to continue his search. His
first step was to go to
the calaboose, where he managed to obtain an interview with Hatchie.
The poor fellow was in an
agony of grief,—not on his own account, but on that of his
mistress, for he well
understood the reason of this imprisonment.</p>
            <p>Hatchie, of course, could give him no information of the
whereabouts of Emily, nor offer any
suggestion; and Vernon was compelled to leave the disheartened
mulatto, with only a promise of
speedily effecting his deliverance.</p>
            <p>Vernon's next step was to ascertain the present abiding place of
Maxwell, if, indeed, he was
in the city; and for this purpose he had gone to his office. The open
room did not verify the
statements of the negress. He knew that Maxwell always closed up his
rooms when he left the
city, and the fact of their being open now tended to fix suspicion upon<pb n="283"/>
him, or rather
to confirm the suspicions before entertained. He had made the visit
to the attorney's rooms to
gain information; and, being partly convinced, by the manner of the
negress, that the rear
chamber was occupied, he retired to the coffee-room to digest the
knowledge, and, if possible,
arrive at some conclusion through it, as well as at the same time to
keep watch of the movements
at the office.</p>
            <p>Who was this De Guy, who had been the agent of Maxwell?—for
such he determined
to believe him, until convinced to the contrary. He canvassed their
mutual acquaintances, but
could remember no such person. Intimate as he had been with all the
associates of Maxwell, he
could not identify this bold and cunning confederate.</p>
            <p>He had not long deliberated, when, to his surprise,—albeit
it was not an event at all
remarkable,—Maxwell entered the coffee-room.</p>
            <p>Before Vernon had time to decide whether or not he should charge
the lawyer with the
abduction of Emily, that worthy approached his chair, and, with much
cordiality,—more
than he had formerly bestowed upon him,—extended his hand, and
expressed his
happiness at again meeting him in the city.</p>
            <p>Undecided as yet how to proceed, Vernon returned his salutations
with an appearance of
equal cordiality.</p>
            <p>"My dear fellow," said Maxwell, "I am rejoiced to see you in town
again. I was afraid you
would quite desert us."</p>
            <p>This language was new and strange to Vernon. It sounded like the
days in which he had been
respectable—before his vices had found him out.</p>
            <p>"Indeed! why did you think so?" replied Vernon.</p>
            <p>"Why, Vernon, there was some kind of a ridiculous story current at
Vicksburg; to the effect
that you had joined the church, or something of that sort."</p>
            <p>"Ha, ha! funny!" said Vernon, adopting the free and easy style,
which had formerly
distinguished his colloquial efforts.</p>
            <p>"Where did you pick up the story?"</p>
            <pb n="284"/>
            <p>"O, it was quite current when I left Vicksburg."</p>
            <p>"A good joke, hey?" said Vernon, musing.</p>
            <p>When Maxwell left Vicksburg, it was impossible that any such story
could have been extant.
Of his reformation no one but the people of Cottage Island could have
known anything. It
seemed a little mysterious that Maxwell should know of it; but the
fact of De Guy's visit to the
house of his father came to his assistance, and the mystery was
solved. De Guy had
communicated this information to Maxwell, and thus he was enabled to
establish conclusively
the connection between them.</p>
            <p>Vernon's plan for the future was adopted; and manifesting no
surprise, he denied the fact of
his reformation, however strong the circumstances might be against
him. He had often been
implicated in fouler deceptions than this in a worse cause, and, in
spite of his great resolves, he
did not hesitate in this instance.</p>
            <p>"Quite a sell, wasn't it, this reformation? The old gentleman has
a fine place up
there,—money in the bank,—hey, boy? I saw through the
whole of it, as soon as I
heard the absurd story," said Maxwell, who, to do him justice, did
not believe the tale. It was too
much for his credulity, that a thing like Vernon could be animated by a good
motive,—could, by any possibility, abandon the error of his ways.</p>
            <p>"Just so, Max. The fact is, I found the old fellow had plenty of
money, and no one but me to
leave it to; so I thought it would be a devilish pity to have it all
go to found a hospital, an
orthodox college, or some such absurdity, and I could not resist the
temptation to become a little
saintly, just for a few days."</p>
            <p>"Bravo, Vernon! You will yet be a rich man. You did it well. The
old fellow swallowed it all,
didn't he?"</p>
            <p>"As an alderman does turtle-soup. But, Max, where did you slip to
from Vicksburg?"</p>
            <p>"To tell you the truth, I was a little afraid of your penitence,
and thought it was not safe to be
in the same coach<pb n="285"/>
with you; so I gave you the slip, by going down the river by land a
few miles, and then taking the boat."</p>
            <p>"But you didn't know I had reformed then,—ha, ha, ha!"</p>
            <p>"Yes. I heard something about it before I left the
island,—I overheard that Jerry
Swinger and the mulatto boy speaking of it. But I own, Vernon, I was
too hasty, to judge you
unheard."</p>
            <p>"Max, who is this De Guy?"</p>
            <p>"De Guy," said Maxwell, with feigned astonishment; "don't know him."</p>
            <p>"Bah, Max! don't you know that you cannot <emph>wool</emph> me?
By the way, that
was a clumsy trick of yours, sending this De Guy after the girl. When
he had gone, the captain
would have chased him, if I had not come and assured them that the
terrible Maxwell could not
possibly be concerned in the affair."</p>
            <p>"Indeed! did you do me this essential service?" said Maxwell,
forgetting that he had denied
his connection with De Guy.</p>
            <p>"I did. If you had left the matter with me, I could have done it
better."</p>
            <p>"Well, Vernon, I see you are all right yet; but the thing worked
to a charm. De Guy is the
cleverest fellow out. The girl is safe."</p>
            <p>"So I suppose," said Vernon, with an assumption of indifference.</p>
            <p>"But all the sport is yet to come."</p>
            <p>"Indeed," said Vernon, burning with anxiety, but to maintain his
accustomed easy and
reckless air.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Vernon, all the hard work we did up the river shall not be
in vain. I shall win the
prize!" and Maxwell rubbed his hands at the pleasant anticipation.</p>
            <p>"Wish you joy, Max! But you don't mean to marry the girl?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly."</p>
            <pb n="286"/>
            <p>"What! a quadroon?"</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! that story is all blown through. Her old uncle, up the
river, got up that abstraction,
so as to finger her property," said Maxwell, forgetting, in his
candor, the scruples which his
companion had expressed on a former occasion with relation to
persecuting a white
woman,—scruples which Vernon did not seem disposed to press
upon the attorney's
memory.</p>
            <p>"You helped him through with his scheme?" answered Vernon, with a
bold, careless air.</p>
            <p>"'Pon honor, I had nothing to do with it. Old Jaspar did it all
himself," replied Maxwell, with
an oath.</p>
            <p>"Looks a little like you, though," said Vernon, with a nonchalance
which provoked Maxwell,
whose temper was not of the mildest tone.</p>
            <p>"Nevertheless, it is none of mine, though the plan was a
creditable one. But it has brought old
Jaspar into a wasp's nest."</p>
            <p>"How 's that?"</p>
            <p>"I had my eye on the girl, ever since the colonel died. I saw
through Jaspar's plot, and a little
bravado made him tell me all about it."</p>
            <p>"Good!"</p>
            <p>"Just so; and, as they are old clients of mine, why, I could not
do less than get them out of the
scrape, and remove the stain from the name of the fair heiress."</p>
            <p>"How can you do it?"</p>
            <p>"That 's the point."</p>
            <p>"Looks rather complicated."</p>
            <p>"Exactly so; but energy and skill will accomplish wonders."</p>
            <p>"Very true," replied Vernon, in his usual quiet manner, well
knowing that Maxwell would
take the alarm if he appeared in the least inquisitive,—so he
contented himself with this
simple ejaculation.</p>
            <pb n="287"/>
            <p>"Can I trust you still?" said Maxwell, in a low tone, and with an
anxious look,
after a pause of several minutes.</p>
            <p>"I care not whether you trust me or not," replied Vernon, with
characteristic indifference.</p>
            <p>"Are you the man you were two months ago? If you are, I need ask
no more questions."</p>
            <p>"I am. And now let me tell you, if you have work for me, the pay
must be liberal. I have
reformed in one respect, and that is from low prices to high ones. I
have done too many of your
little chores for nothing. Good pay is my motto now."</p>
            <p>"Be it so," replied Maxwell, whose suspicions, as Vernon had
intended, were diverted by this
by-talk. "I will pay you well. If my plan succeeds, three thousand."</p>
            <p>"Good! that sounds liberal. But suppose it fail?"</p>
            <p>"It cannot fail."</p>
            <p>"What is the plan? You mean to help old Jaspar out of the scrape,
and save the girl too. How
can you do it?"</p>
            <p>"There is only one way—marry the girl!"</p>
            <p>"Just so," replied Vernon, with an indifference it was hard to assume.</p>
            <p>"Here are the whole details of the plan. I have Jaspar's consent
to my marriage with the girl,
but I dare not attempt to consummate the scheme in the city. She is
so cursed obstinate, that it is
a hard matter to manage her. I saw Jaspar last night, and we
concluded to have the ceremony
performed at Bellevue, as soon as possible, or that fiery son of Mars
and your worthy patriarch
will be down upon us, and spoil the whole."</p>
            <p>"Never fear them," said Vernon. "You will not proceed for a week
or two?"</p>
            <p>"A week or so will make no difference. But I am afraid it will
take more time than that to
induce her to consent. The difficulty which has troubled me more than
any other is to get her to
Bellevue. She tells Dido that she will not go alive. She fears Jaspar
more than she does me, and
rightly<pb n="288"/>
suspects that if she yields she will have to encounter both. She has not seen
me since the row at the wood-yard, and I intend to transact all
business with her through De
Guy."</p>
            <p>"She is a difficult case," suggested Vernon, to fill up a pause in
Maxwell's speech.</p>
            <p>"Now, it has occurred to me," continued Maxwell, "that
<emph>you</emph> could manage
her like a young lamb."</p>
            <p>"I!" exclaimed Vernon.</p>
            <p>"Certainly. You stand well with her, do you not?"</p>
            <p>"Like a saint."</p>
            <p>"You can get up a rescue, or something of that sort, you know."</p>
            <p>"To be sure," replied Vernon, thoughtfully.</p>
            <p>"Pretend that you are going to effect her escape."</p>
            <p>"Capital!" said Vernon, suddenly; "I <emph>will</emph> pretend to
effect her escape. But
there is one difficulty—" and he suddenly checked his apparent
zeal, and assumed a
thoughtful air.</p>
            <p>"A difficulty?"</p>
            <p>"Ay. I must be at Baton Rouge to-morrow night, or all my hopes up
the river are lost."</p>
            <p>"And you will return—"</p>
            <p>Vernon reflected, and then replied,</p>
            <p>"In four days."</p>
            <p>"That will do. Don't let it be more than four days."</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"And, Vernon, you had better write to the military lover that the
lady is doing
well—that Jaspar's health is improving, &amp;c. They won't
hurry down, then."</p>
            <p>"A good thought. I <emph>will</emph> write to him."</p>

            <p>"VILLAIN!" muttered Vernon, as Maxwell
left the coffee-room, "your work of iniquity is nearly done. If from
the depths of my seared heart
can come up one single good impulse to guide me, I will bring the
guilty and the innocent to
their just desert."</p>
            <p>He had told Maxwell that he should go to Baton Rouge, and prudence
required him to go. He
had certain intelligence that a boat would leave in an hour, and he
hastily wrote the letter to
Captain Carroll. This letter was not exactly of the tenor Maxwell had
bargained for, inasmuch as
the object of it was to request the immediate presence of his father
and Henry at Bellevue, which
promised soon to be the theatre of war. With this letter in his
pocket, he made his way to the
levee, and departed for Baton Rouge.</p>
            <p>It was with some compunction that he took this seemingly
inconsistent step. It was, for the
time, turning his back upon the object to which he had devoted
himself. It was necessary for him
to gain time, even at the sacrifice of Emily's feelings, for a short
season, so that his father and
Henry Carroll might reach Bellevue as soon as Emily. He had written
them all the details of the
plan. His own purpose was to have Emily's strongest friends at hand
on her arrival at Bellevue,
so as effectually to foil the machinations of Jaspar and<pb n="290"/>
Maxwell. His own visit to
Baton Rouge was only a feint to avoid a meeting with Maxwell in the
interim, thus keeping the
appearance in unison with the pretension.</p>
            <p>The river had risen some three or four feet, and the large and
rapid steamers had commenced
running. The "Raven," to the clerk of which he had intrusted the
letter for Cottage Island, was a
remarkably fast boat, and he had every reason to hope that his plan
would be successful.</p>
            <p>Three days he remained at Baton Rouge, in a state of impatience
and inactivity, rendered
doubly uncomfortable by the fear that Maxwell might change his plan
in his absence.</p>
            <p>A downward steamer was approaching the city, and he hastened on
board. His letter had been
faithfully delivered, for almost the first person he discovered on
board the boat was Henry
Carroll, and Dr. Vaudelier was close at hand. This was excellent, and
he congratulated himself on
the bright prospect before him.</p>
            <p>It was arranged that the doctor and his late patient should remain
in the vicinity of Bellevue
until the following day, when Vernon would convey Emily to her home.
They were accordingly
landed at the Red Church, and Vernon proceeded to New Orleans.</p>
            <p>Maxwell greeted him with a cordiality which showed the interest he
felt in the scheme, the
consummation of which would realize his dreams of luxurious
indulgence. They wended their
way, without loss of time, up the street, deciding that Vernon should
at once broach the
proposition to Emily of going up to Bellevue. The attorney, when they
had arrived within a short
distance of the office, directed Vernon to proceed alone, agreeing to
meet him at a coffee-room in
the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>On reaching the office, a new difficulty was presented. The
inflexible guardian of Emily
refused to allow Vernon to see her, stoutly persisting that De Guy
would not permit it. Vernon
was obliged to resort to Maxwell in this dilemma, who, affirming that
he did not wish Emily to
know of his<pb n="291"/>
presence in town, had kept the secret from the negress. So what could he
do? But, bidding Vernon wait, he left the coffee-room, and soon
returned with an order signed by
De Guy, whom, Maxwell affirmed, he had been so fortunate as to meet
at the Exchange.</p>
            <p>"But of what use is this paper? The girl cannot read. Shall I take
the keys from her?" asked
Vernon.</p>
            <p>"The note will be sufficient. Show it to her; she will pretend to
read it, and would, if it were
in Hebrew or Sanscrit," said Maxwell, who then repeated the caution
he had before given, not to
betray the fact of his presence in the city.</p>
            <p>Vernon presented the note to the negress, who, with a
business-like, air, opened it; and,
though he could perceive that she held it up-side down, she examined
it long and attentively,
sputtering with her thick lips, as though actually engaged in the to
her impossible operation of
reading it.</p>
            <p>"Dis alters de case, Massa. Why you no show dis paper before?"
said Dido, with an air of
huge importance, which would have done credit to the captain of a
country company of militia.</p>
            <p>"Open the door, and don't stop to chatter!" replied Vernon.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Massa, I have read de letter, and now I knows dat Massa Guy
wants you to see de
leddy. Dat alters de case. I has nussin furder to say," muttered
Dido, as she unlocked the chamber
door.</p>
            <p>Emily was seated on a sofa, reading a book she had taken with her
to while away the time on
board of the steamer.</p>
            <p>"Missus, a gemman, who hab brought a letter from Massa Guy," said
Dido, as she opened the
door.</p>
            <p>"Bring the letter, then," replied Emily, scarcely raising her eyes
from the book.</p>
            <p>"No, Missus, de letter am for me, and I hab read it. It orders me
to 'mit dis gemman."</p>
            <pb n="292"/>
            <p>That is sufficient," said Vernon, pushing the attendant back, and
closing the door.</p>
            <p>Emily rose; and great was her surprise at perceiving the son of
her late benefactor. An
avalanche of doubt rushed through her mind, and she could not
conjecture the occasion of this
visit. She had left him at his father's house. Had he forsaken his
new-born repentance? Was he
again the minister of Maxwell's evil purposes? She had been a prey to
the most distressing
anticipations, and had now settled down into the calmness of
resignation. Resolved to die rather
than become the bride of Maxwell, she had spent the hours and days of
her imprisonment in
nerving herself to meet whatever bitter fate might await her, in
maintaining her purity and her
principle.</p>
            <p>The appearance of Jerome Vaudelier caused her a thrill of
apprehension, but it was quickly
supplanted by a feeling of interest in the individual himself. Her
own gloomy position seemed
divested of its sombreness, as she felt that the penitence of the
erring soul had not been a reality.</p>
            <p>"Jerome Vaudelier, are you, too, the minister of a villain's wishes?"</p>
            <p>"Nay, Miss Dumont—"</p>
            <p>"Say that you are yet true to yourself; that you have not
forgotten those solemn vows you
made in the home of your father; say that you are not the tool of the
vile Maxwell—say it
before you speak your business with me!"</p>
            <p>"Miss Dumont, I acknowledge that the present appearance is against
me; but I assure you I
have come only as the minister of good to you."</p>
            <p>"Bless you for the words! I feared you had again been tempted."</p>
            <p>"So I have, lady, and apparently have yielded; but it was only to
save you. Listen to me, and
I will disclose all the details of the plots which are even now
ripening to ensnare
you,"—and Vernon, in a low tone, briefly narrated <orig>every-</orig>
               <pb n="293"/>
thing, and the means which were in operation to secure her safety.</p>
            <p>"You must go to Bellevue to-morrow, there to meet my father and
Captain Carroll," said he.</p>
            <p>The color came to her pale cheek, at the mention of her lover's
name. She felt that Vernon
meant to be true to her, and true to himself. And it required no
persuasion to induce her to
acquiesce in the arrangements.</p>
            <p>"But, Hatchie—must I leave him in prison? It is not a meet
reward for his fidelity."</p>
            <p>"It cannot be avoided, Miss Dumont. I will see him today, and when
his honest heart knows
that you are in safety, he will be just as happy in a prison as in a
palace. He shall be set at liberty
in a few days."</p>
            <p>"I hope he may. Does this De Guy accompany you?"</p>
            <p>"No; but Maxwell says he will reach Bellevue as soon as we do."</p>
            <p>"Why is this? Why does not Maxwell present himself, and urge his
infamous proposals?"</p>
            <p>"I know not, unless it be that De Guy is the more artful of the two."</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>Let us change the scene to the next day, at the abode of Mr. Faxon.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie and his wife, by the kind attentions of their host, were
restored to a comparatively
healthy state. The lady had suffered much in her physical and mental
constitution, and a shade of
deep melancholy rested upon her handsome features. She could not
forget the horrors of the
dungeon in which she had been confined. It seemed a great epoch in
her life; all before it was
strange and undefined, while every trivial incident since was a great
paragraph in her history.</p>
            <p>Mr. Faxon was seated in his library, surrounded by his guests. The
affairs of the Dumont
family had again been discussed, for to them they were full of interest.</p>
            <pb n="294"/>
            <p>The good minister feelingly expatiated upon the bitterness of the
heiress' lot,
brought up as she had been amid all the refinements of polished
society, whose sensibilities were
rendered doubly acute by nature and the circumstances which environed
her, to be thus degraded
into the condition of a base-born, despised being,—to be so
suddenly hurled from honor
and opulence,—it was a dreadful blow! So feelingly did he
narrate the particulars, so
tenderly did he describe the loneliness of her position, that his
hearers were deeply affected, and
Delia shed a flood of tears.</p>
            <p>"I too have been a wanderer, though a voluntary one, from the home
of my father," said she.</p>
            <p>"Nay, Delia," said Dalhousie, tenderly; "do not revert to your own
experience. Remember
you are not strong enough to bear much excitement."</p>
            <p>"I did not intend to speak of my own experience; but the
sufferings of poor Miss Dumont call
to my mind the remembrance of similar feelings."</p>
            <p>"I presume the company are not desirous of hearing the story of an
elopement," said
Dalhousie, with a smile.</p>
            <p>"Nor I to relate one. The pure devotion of Miss Dumont to the
memory of her father recalls
the affection, the fond indulgence, of my own father. I have not, as
she has, the consciousness of
having never wilfully abused his confidence."</p>
            <p>"If you have erred, madam," said Mr. Faxon, "your father still
lives, does he not? Perhaps it
is not yet too late to atone for the fault."</p>
            <p>"Alas! I know not whether he is living or not. I wrote to him
several times, but never
received an answer."</p>
            <p>"Who was your father, madam?" said Mr. Faxon, with much sympathy
in the tones of his
voice.</p>
            <p>"I dread even to mention the name I bore in the innocent days of
childhood."</p>
            <p>"Fie, Delia!" said Dalhousie, with a pleasant laugh, "what have
you done to sink yourself so
far in your own<pb n="295"/>
estimation? You and your father differed as to the propriety of our
marriage; to you, as a true woman, your course was plain. This is the
height and depth of your
monstrous sin."</p>
            <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the announcement that a
gentleman waited to see
Mr. Faxon.</p>
            <p>The good clergyman had a habit of promptness in answering all
calls upon him. This custom
had been acquired by the reflection that a poor dying mortal might
wait his blessing, ere he
departed on his endless journey; that, sometimes, a moment's delay
could never be atoned for;
therefore he rose on the instant, and hastened to the parlor, where
the visitor waited.</p>
            <p>"Ah! is it possible—Captain Carroll!" said he, as he grasped
Henry's hand; "I am glad
to see you. But how pale and thin you look!"</p>
            <p>"Good reason for it, my dear sir. I was on board of the Chalmetta."</p>
            <p>"Were you, indeed! Thank God, you escaped with life! Were you much
injured?"</p>
            <p>"I was, but, thanks to the care of a good physician, I am nearly
restored again."</p>
            <p>"But our poor lady—Miss Dumont—have you any tidings of
her? Report said
she was lost in the catastrophe."</p>
            <p>"She is safe, though, unfortunately, at present in bad hands;" and
Henry related to the
astonished minister the events of Emily's history since her departure
from Bellevue, not
concealing even the details of his present relations with her.</p>
            <p>"And now, my dear sir," said he, rising to depart, "the crisis has
come. Dr. Vaudelier waits
close by, and we are ready to witness the denouement of this climax
of plots. It is already time
for Jerome and Emily to arrive, and we desire your immediate presence
at the mansion-house."</p>
            <p>"I will attend you. But I have in the house several friends of
Miss Dumont—"</p>
            <p>"Bring them all with you," interrupted Henry, looking<pb n="296"/>
at his watch. "The more
witnesses the better, especially if they be friends."</p>

            <p>JASPAR DUMONT was seated in the library. The
ravages of care and vice were growing more plainly visible on his
face. His countenance was
haggard, and his complexion seemed to be a struggle between the
wanness of care and the
redness of intemperance.</p>
            <p>Near him sat De Guy, who had but just arrived.</p>
            <p>"The lady has come," said the attorney, adjusting his green
spectacles; "and I am here to
claim the fulfilment of our contract."</p>
            <p>Jaspar looked up from the floor, upon which his eyes had been
fastened, and gazed with a
fixed stare upon his companion.</p>
            <p>"You do not understand me," insinuated De Guy.</p>
            <p>"I do," said Jaspar, sternly; "I do; you have come to plunder me."</p>
            <p>"You do me injustice, my kind friend; I come to save you from the
doom of a felon."</p>
            <p>"To put your foot upon my neck, and leap out of the pit your
villany has dug!"</p>
            <p>"Very well, my dear sir, if you are of this mind, my<pb n="298"/>
course is plain. Did you not
agree to this arrangement?" said De Guy, with a smile, which was
meant to soften the hard
question.</p>
            <p>"True, I did," replied Jaspar, with a whining sullenness. "What
would you have of me now?"</p>
            <p>"Only that you fulfil the stipulations of the bargain."</p>
            <p>"Can I fulfil them? Can I marry you, even if the girl were willing?"</p>
            <p>"You can give your commands. Will she not obey them?"</p>
            <p>"Fool if she does!" muttered Jaspar, in a low tone.</p>
            <p>"She will be so glad to be restored to her home, I fancy she will
not think the terms are hard."</p>
            <p>"I don't know," said Jaspar, eying the attorney from head to foot.
"I consent to the marriage. I
can do no more."</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you will be willing to use a little gentle force, to save
your own neck," said the
attorney, with something like a sneer.</p>
            <p>"Anything, anything, that will silence your damning tongue, and
rid me of your teasing!"</p>
            <p>"Now, sir, you are reasonable."</p>
            <p>"Summon the girl," said Jaspar, impatiently. "I will say all I
have to say in a few words. But,
if she foils you, it is not my fault."</p>
            <p>"True sir; but Miss Dumont, at this critical juncture of her
affairs, will have respect for your
counsels;" and the attorney withdrew to call her.</p>
            <p>Emily entered the abode of her early years, and the memories of
the past came crowding
thick upon her. She seemed to realize that her sorrows were near an
end, but the hope which such
a pleasant thought inspired could not entirely overcome the gloom
which the scene around her
was calculated to produce. It was here she had often rambled with her
father, and a thousand
trivial incidents presented themselves to remind her of him.</p>
            <pb n="299"/>
            <p>As she entered the house, she clung to the arm of Vernon, as though she was
entering the abode of evil spirits; for, with all the memories of the
past, she could not forget that
the home of her childhood was inhabited by her inhuman uncle.</p>
            <p>She had been but a short time seated in the old, familiar
drawing-room, like a stranger now,
when De Guy entered, to request her presence in the library. She
rose, and looked at Vernon,
who, understanding the glance, approached, as if to bear her company.</p>
            <p>"This gentleman had better remain here," suggested De Guy.</p>
            <p>"I prefer that he should attend me," said Emily, firmly, even
while her heart rose to her
throat, at the thought of meeting her uncle.</p>
            <p>"But really, madam, his presence would embarrass the business of
the interview."</p>
            <p>"He is a friend," stammered Emily, "and is acquainted with all the
circumstances of this
affair."</p>
            <p>"I will attend her, sir," said Vernon, who had before remained silent.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," said the attorney, looking sharply at Vernon, "but it
will be impossible to
transact any business in presence of others."</p>
            <p>"Lead on," said Vernon, sternly; "I will attend the lady, in spite
of all objections."</p>
            <p>"Sir, you are insolent!" said the attorney, tartly, though without
the loss of his
self-possession.</p>
            <p>"The gentleman will not in the least retard the business. Pray
pass on," interposed Emily,
fearful of a collision between the parties.</p>
            <p>"It is impossible, madam. I must insist that he remain here. Such
is Mr. Dumont's express
order."</p>
            <p>"Will you say to Mr. Dumont that the lady demands my attendance?
Perhaps he will yield
the point," answered Vernon.</p>
            <pb n="300"/>
            <p>"I will see him, but it is useless. I know his views;" and De Guy
left the room.</p>
            <p>"Do not hesitate to go with him, Miss Dumont; I will be close at
hand; but no violence will
be offered you. I see my father and Captain Carroll coming up the
road," said Vernon, looking
out the window. "Yield, if necessary, and fear nothing."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Dumont persists in his purpose of meeting the lady alone,"
said De Guy, as he reentered
the drawing-room.</p>
            <p>"The lady, in your absence, has concluded to dispense with my
attendance," replied Vernon.</p>
            <p>"This way, madam,"—and the attorney, with punctilious
politeness, led the way.</p>
            <p>Vernon threw himself upon a sofa, as they were leaving; but no
sooner had the door closed,
than he rose in haste, and left the apartment. Reaching the veranda
of the house, he met Dr.
Vaudelier and Henry Carroll, who followed him back to the drawing-room.</p>
            <p>"This way, silently, if you please," said he, and then closed the
door. A moment sufficed to
inform the new comers of the position of affairs; then Vernon left
the room, and went to the
library door, which he found, by Henry's direction. Stationing
himself in a recess behind some
coats, he waited till his presence should be needed.</p>
            <p>The meeting between Emily and her uncle was not embarrassed by any
formal greetings.
Jaspar did not even raise his eyes from the floor, as she entered. He
heard the door close, and
being aware by the silence of the parties—for De Guy had judged
an announcement
unnecessary—that they were ready to hear him, he said, in a
gentle tone,</p>
            <p>"Emily, I have sent for you to receive a proposition, which will
finally terminate the
unfortunate circumstances that have shrouded our family in hostility
and misery."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, uncle, I have no feeling of hostility towards you. God
forbid!" replied Emily, upon
whose agitated senses Jaspar's mild words had fallen like promises of
peace.</p>
            <pb n="301"/>
            <p>Jaspar was astonished. He had lost much of the severity of his
disposition in the
miseries which had overtaken him. He was humiliated, his spirit
broken, and he could not
understand why his victim did not upbraid him, as he expected, for
the wrongs he had inflicted.
A momentary hope of reconciliation on better terms crossed his mind;
but there stood the
attorney, who would permit no other compromise.</p>
            <p>"I restore your fortune," said Jaspar, with a shudder, as he
raised his head for the first time
from the floor to look upon his niece,—"I restore it, on one
condition."</p>
            <p>"Name not the fortune, uncle; your peace and happiness are far
dearer to me than all the
wealth of the world. You have wronged me, but I freely forgive you;
and Heaven will also
forgive you, if you sin no more. O, uncle, I beseech you dismiss this
evil man, and let me be to
you as a daughter!"</p>
            <p>"Let us attend to business, if you please, Mr. Dumont," said the
attorney, in a whining tone;
for, it must be confessed, the conversation had assumed a different
turn from what he had
anticipated.</p>
            <p>"I must state the business for which I requested your presence,"
said Jaspar, not a little
moved by the words of Emily. Human nature is a strange compound of
inconsistencies. This
man, whose life had been stained with crime, was now disposed to
regard the past with
contrition. We have seen him scorning even an allusion to the higher
life of the soul,—but
success was then within the reach of his crime-stained hand! Now,
failure on every hand awaited
him, and all those bravadoes with which he had kept down his better
nature deserted him. Not
one scornful thought came to banish the good angel from his presence.
But the feeling was of
short duration. It was but a momentary contrition, which a selfish
hope or a burst of passion
could dissipate.</p>
            <p>"I will restore your fortune, on one condition," said he. "You can
accept or reject it, at your
option."</p>
            <p>"I beg your pardon," suggested the attorney, "these were not
exactly the terms of our
contract."</p>
            <pb n="302"/>
            <p>"Name the condition, uncle," added Emily, indifferently; for she
was anxious to
have the business, whatever it might be, finished, so that she could
again plead with Jasper for
his personal reformation, for she was a little encouraged by the
appearance of humiliation he had
manifested.</p>
            <p>"I restore your fortune, on condition that you give your hand to
this gentleman in
marriage;"—and Jaspar again fixed his eyes on the floor, as if
he dreaded the outbreak of a
storm.</p>
            <p>"This gentleman!" exclaimed Emily, indignantly. "This
gentleman!"—and she gazed
upon him with a proud look of contempt, from which the attorney would
fain have hid his head.
Her surprise was equal to her indignation. Vernon had told her that
<emph>Maxwell</emph>
was to be the suppliant for her hand, and she could not see why his
menial had the presumption
to claim her.</p>
            <p>"This gentleman!" repeated Emily. "I had rather die a thousand deaths!"</p>
            <p>"Then, madam, we shall be obliged to compel you to this step,"
replied De Guy, stung by the
scorn of Emily, and distrusting the energy of Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"Sir, your impertinence deserves a severer rebuke than I can
administer!" said Emily, the
blood mounting to her face.</p>
            <p>"But it must be even so, madam," returned the attorney coolly.
"Fate has so decreed. Your
good uncle's circumstances imperatively demand it."</p>
            <p>"Is this so, uncle?"</p>
            <p>"It is, Emily. You must submit to your fate, unpleasant though it
may be," said Jaspar,
looking at her with an absent stare.</p>
            <p>"No, uncle, it shall not be so. I never will submit to such a
fate. What circumstances do you
refer to?"</p>
            <p>"I am in this man's power."</p>
            <p>"God be with you, then! But I understand it all. He seeks my
fortune, not myself. I would
rather he had the<pb n="303"/>
whole of it, than become such a <emph>thing</emph> as to marry
that man!"</p>
            <p>"Nay, lady, <emph>you</emph> are of more worth to me than your
fortune, large as it is. I
have contracted with your uncle for your hand, and he must pay the
price," said De Guy.</p>
            <p>"He speaks truly, Emily. I have <emph>sold</emph> you to him,"
replied Jaspar, vacantly.</p>
            <p>Emily was stung to the quick. This remark, she supposed, was in
allusion to her alleged
condition and the tears rose to her eyes, while the indignant blood
mounted to her cheek.</p>
            <p>"Uncle, do not brand your soul with infamy!" she said, quickly.</p>
            <p>"What!" exclaimed Jaspar, roused to a burst of passion.</p>
            <p>"Be not a villain!" returned Emily, whose good-nature was sorely tried.</p>
            <p>"Girl, beard not the lion in his den! I had half relented, but now
I feel strong again!" and he
rose and tottered to the table, on which his brandy-bottle stood.
After taking a deep draught, he
reseated himself.</p>
            <p>"You must marry this man!" said he, fiercely striking the table
with his fist.</p>
            <p>"I never will!" replied Emily, trembling at Jaspar's violence, but
firm in her purpose.</p>
            <p>"Remember! girl, remember what you are!" said Jaspar, passionately.</p>
            <p>"Enough of this," said Emily. "I leave you for—"</p>
            <p>"Stay, lady! You must not leave the room," interrupted De Guy,
laying his hand upon her
arm.</p>
            <p>"Remove your hand, villain, nor dare to pollute me with your
touch!" exclaimed Emily,
shaking off his hand as though it had been contamination.</p>
            <p>The hitherto placid features of the attorney darkened into a scowl
of malignity, as he said,</p>
            <p>"Madam, we have been too long subject to your caprice. Here let it
end. Know that mighty
interests depend upon<pb n="304"/>
the union this day to be consummated, and we refuse longer to
submit to your whims."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Emily, the honor and safety of your family name depend upon
your acquiescence in
this plan," said Jaspar, whose passion had moderated a little.</p>
            <p>"I will never countenance any of your unhallowed plots," replied
Emily, and she again
moved towards the door.</p>
            <p>"You leave not the room till you consent to this union,"
interposed De Guy.</p>
            <p>"Stand from my path, or I will summon assistance!"</p>
            <p>"Your summons would be in vain."</p>
            <p>With a proud step and a curling lip, Emily attempted to advance;
but De Guy seized her by
the arm, and restrained her. She struggled to free herself from the
villain's grasp, without success.
Knowing that Vernon was within hearing of her, she called "Jerome,"
at the top of her voice.</p>
            <p>"No use, madam. The gentleman whose name you utter is a friend of
mine," said the
attorney. "He conveyed you here as an emissary of mine. Haven't you
known him before?" said
De Guy, with a mixture of sarcasm and triumph in the tones of his
squeaky voice.</p>
            <p>The door-handle was at this moment seized on the outside. The door
was wrenched and
pushed, but it did not yield, for De Guy had taken the precaution to
lock it.</p>
            <p>"Who is there?" shouted the attorney, alarmed at the intrusion.</p>
            <p>"Open," said Jerome, "or I force the door!"</p>
            <p>"What does this mean?" asked Jaspar, who had remained a quiet
spectator to the violence
offered his niece.</p>
            <p>"I will soon ascertain," said De Guy, dragging Emily after him,
towards a large closet on the
other side of the room.</p>
            <p>"Help! help!" again screamed Emily; and, ere she had the second
time uttered the word, a
crash was heard, the library-door splintered, and Vernon stood in the room.</p>
            <p>"How is this? Villain! traitor!" shouted De Guy, drawing from his
pocket a revolver.</p>
            <pb n="305"/>
            <p>"Unhand the lady!' said Vernon, in a severe tone, as, at the same
time, he drew
from his pocket a pistol. "Unhand her!" and he approached the lawyer.</p>
            <p>"Back, traitor, or you die!" said De Guy, in a voice which
suddenly lost its silky tone, and
was firm and round.</p>
            <p>"Then I die like a man!" responded Vernon, still advancing.</p>
            <p>Jaspar's ferocious nature, stimulated to activity by the prospect
of a fight, now promised to
revive his spirits and nerve his arm. He advanced behind Vernon, and,
ere he was aware, had
clasped both hands around him. Vernon tried to free himself from the
bearish hug, and they both
fell to the floor. Jaspar still held tight, and the struggle promised
to be a severe one.</p>
            <p>De Guy perceived the movement of Jaspar, and, as soon as the
combatants had fallen to the
floor, he restored the pistol to his pocket, so that, unembarrassed,
he might convey Emily to a
place of security, until this unlooked-for contest was ended.
Scarcely was the pistol in his pocket,
when the window behind him flew open, and the attorney was in the
iron gripe of a powerful
arm! Emily, freed from her assailant, retreated to the other side of
the room, where, glancing in
terror upon the new assault, she saw De Guy thrown violently upon the
floor by her ever-present
and ever-faithful slave, Hatchie!</p>
            <p>The mulatto, having been allowed the liberty of the yard early in
the evening before, had
contrived to effect his escape from the calaboose, and had walked the
whole distance from New
Orleans.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll and Dr. Vaudelier had heard the confusion, and
judged that the conflict had
begun with something more than the war of words. Hatchie had scarcely
done his work when
Henry reached the library, and rescued Vernon from the hands of Jaspar.</p>
            <p>The contest was ended, and the victors and vanquished stood
contemplating each other in
mute astonishment. Dr.<pb n="306"/>
Vaudelier, who had followed Henry into the room, assisted
Jaspar to rise, and conducted him to a chair. The courage of the
vanquished seemed entirely to
have oozed out, and they remained doggedly considering the new state
of things.</p>
            <p>Hatchie bent over his fallen foe, and, drawing from his pocket the
revolver and bowie-knife
which rendered him a formidable person, he loosed his firm hold of
him, as if it was an
acknowledgment of weakness to hold him longer a close prisoner.
Seizing the prostrate lawyer
by the hair, he bade him rise, at the same time giving a sharp twist
to the ornamental appendage
of his cranium. But the hair yielded to the motion of his hand, and
the entire scalp scaled off,
bringing with it the huge parti-colored whiskers, and revealing a
beautiful head of black, curly
hair, where the mixed color had before predominated!</p>
            <p>"What does this mean? Methinks I have seen that head of hair
before," said Henry Carroll.</p>
            <p>"The face is not of the natural color," added Dr. Vaudelier,
remarking that the skin of the
forehead, which the wig had concealed, was very white, and almost
transparent, while the face
was besmeared with the color that composed the florid complexion of
the attorney.</p>
            <p>"Take off his spectacles, Hatchie," said Henry. The glasses were
removed, and a pair of
piercing black eyes glared upon them.</p>
            <p>"It is Maxwell, by ——," shouted Jaspar, who had in
some measure recovered
from the exhaustion of his struggle with Vernon, and had watched with
much anxiety the
"unearthing" of his confederate.</p>
            <p>"It is Maxwell," responded Hatchie, tearing open the vest which
encircled the attorney's
portly form, and displaying the cushion that had been used to extend
his corporation.</p>
            <p>"Merciful Heaven! how narrowly have I escaped!" exclaimed Emily,
laying her head in
giddy faintness upon the shoulder of Henry, who, at the moment he was
at liberty, had flown to
her side.</p>
            <pb n="307"/>
            <p>At this moment Mr. Faxon entered, and saw, with astonishment, the
evidence of
the recent fray.</p>
            <p>"Justice is triumphant, I see," said he, taking Emily by the hand,
and affectionately
congratulating her upon her return to Bellevue.</p>
            <p>"Heaven has been more indulgent to me than I deserve,— has
preserved me from a
thousand perils I knew not of; and has, at last, placed me again in
this haven of repose!" replied
Emily.</p>
            <p>"Bless His holy name, my child; for, though we forget Him, He can
never forget us!" said the
minister, devoutly.</p>
            <p>"Well, gentlemen," interrupted Jaspar, with a bitter scowl, "I
trust, when you have finished
your cant, you will depart, and leave me in peace."</p>
            <p>"We will, at this lady's pleasure," said Dr. Vaudelier.</p>
            <p>"Hell! would you trifle with me?" roared Jaspar, rising in a
passion. "Would you turn me out
of my house?"</p>
            <p>"Never yours, Mr. Dumont! Heaven has restored the innocent and
oppressed to her rights,"
answered Mr. Faxon, calmly.</p>
            <p>"Uncle," said Emily, earnestly, "let me entreat you to lay aside
the terrible aspect you have
worn, and be again even as you once were. The past shall be
forgotten, and I will strive to make
the future happy."</p>
            <p>Jaspar gazed at her with a vacant stare, and, muttering some
unintelligible words, sunk back
into his chair, and buried his face beneath his hands. The
consciousness of the utter failure of the
plan he had cherished for years, and the terrible obloquy to which
his crime subjected him,
rushed like an earthquake into his mind. He was completely subdued in
spirit, and groaned in his
anguish.</p>
            <p>"The way of the transgressor is hard," remarked Mr. Faxon, in
pitying tones.</p>
            <p>These words were heard by Jaspar. They touched his pride. He could
not endure the notes of
pity. He raised his head, and his eyes glared with the fury of a demon.</p>
            <pb n="308"/>
            <p>"Leave the house, sir!" gasped he, choking with passion. "Leave my
house, or I
will tear you limb from limb! I can do it, and I <emph>dare</emph> do
it!" and he started
suddenly to the floor. "Yes, I <emph>dare</emph> do it, if you mock
me with your canting
words!"</p>
            <p>His eyes rolled like a maniac's, and he gasped for breath, as he
continued,</p>
            <p>"I am a murderer already!—a double murderer! Dalhousie and
his wife have felt my
vengeance. They have starved like dogs! Their prison is their tomb!"</p>
            <p>"Compose yourself, Mr. Dumont," said Mr. Faxon; "your soul is
still free from the heavy
burden of such a guilt. Dalhousie and his wife live."</p>
            <p>"You lie, canting hypocrite! No mortal arm can save them. They
have been eight days in my
slave jail. Here are the keys," gasped Jaspar, drawing them from his
pocket.</p>
            <p>"You shall see; I will call them," said Mr. Faxon.</p>
            <p>Dalhousie and his wife, followed by Uncle Nathan and Pat Fegan,
entered the room.</p>
            <p>Jaspar fixed his glaring eyes upon those whom he supposed were
rotting within the precincts
of his Inquisition. His power of speech seemed to have deserted him,
and he shook all over like
an aspen-leaf.</p>
            <p>To Jaspar alone on the estate was the secret of Dalhousie's
imprisonment known. He had not
approached the jail, and if any other person was aware that it had
been undermined, they had not
communicated the fact to him.</p>
            <p>As the last party entered, Dr. Vaudelier turned to look upon the
new comers. Starting
suddenly from his chair, he approached them, and gazed with
earnestness into the face of Delia.</p>
            <p>"Is it possible!" said he.</p>
            <p>"My God,—my father!" and father and daughter were locked in
each other's embrace.</p>
            <p>Maxwell, stripped of his disguise, and ruined in his own opinion,
and in the opinion of
everybody else, had watched<pb n="309"/>
all the proceedings we have narrated in silence.
Ashamed of the awkward appearance he made in his undress, and
confused by the sudden change
in his affairs, he was at a loss to know which way to turn.</p>
            <p>Henry Carroll realized the sense of embarrassment that pervaded
all parties, and was desirous
of putting an end to the state of things which promised nothing but
strife and confusion. So he
directed Hatchie to fasten Maxwell's hands together, and keep him
secure. This step the attorney
seemed not inclined to permit, and a struggle ensued.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Dumont," said he, "is this by your order?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied Jaspar, anxious to secure at least one friend. "No!
I am still in my own house,
and the law will protect me."</p>
            <p>"Certainly," returned Maxwell; "this is all a farce. There is not
a single particle of evidence to
disprove the will."</p>
            <p>"Well, now, I reckon there is a leetle grain," said Uncle Nathan,
stepping forward and
producing the will, which had been intrusted to him on board the
Chalmetta. "This will set
matters about right, I rayther guess."</p>
            <p>"What mean you, fellow?" said Jaspar. "What is it?"</p>
            <p>"The genuine will," replied Hatchie, still holding Maxwell. "I
gave it into his hands. To
explain how I came by it, I need only call your attention to a
certain night, when I surprised you
and this honorable gentleman in this very apartment."</p>
            <p>It is all over!" groaned Jaspar.</p>
            <p>"This is a forgery!" exclaimed Maxwell.</p>
            <p>"Ay, a forgery!" repeated Jaspar, catching the attorney's idea.
"Who can prove that this is a
correct will, and the other false?"</p>
            <p>"I can," said Dalhousie. "Here is a duplicate copy, with letters
explaining the reason for
making it, in the testator's own hand-writing."</p>
            <p>Dalhousie candidly stated the means by which he had<pb n="310"/>
obtained possession of the
papers, and trusted his indiscretion would be overlooked. Dr.
Vaudelier frowned, as his
son-in-law related the unworthy part he had performed, and perhaps
felt a consciousness of the
good intentions which had years before induced him to refuse his
consent to the marriage of his
daughter.</p>
            <p>Jaspar yielded the point; but Maxwell, in the hope of gaining
time, boldly proclaimed all the
papers forgeries.</p>
            <p>"It matters not; we will not stop to discuss the matter now. Tie
his hands, Hatchie," said
Henry Carroll, and, with the assistance of others, he was bound, and
handed over to a constable,
upon the warrant of Mr. Faxon, who was a justice.</p>
            <p>The party separated,—Henry and Emily seeking the grove in
front of the house, to
congratulate each other on the happy termination of their season of
difficulty. The meeting
between Dr. Vaudelier and his son and daughter was extremely
interesting, and the hours passed
rapidly away, in listening to the experience of each other. The
meeting concluded with the
making of new resolves, on the part of Dalhousie, to seek "the great
purpose of his life" by
higher and nobler means.</p>
            <p>As the dinner-hour approached, the happy parties were summoned by
Mr. Faxon to visit his
house, and partake of his hospitality. The good man was never happier
in his life than when he
said grace over the noon-day meal, surrounded by the restored heiress
of Bellevue, and her happy
friends.</p>

            <p>OUR story is told. It only remains to condense
the subsequent lives of our characters into a few lines.</p>
            <p>Jaspar Dumont lingered along a few weeks after the return of
Emily; but his life had lost its
vitality. Continued devotion to the demon of the bottle laid him
low,—he was found dead
in the library, having been stricken with an apoplectic fit.</p>
            <p>After the death of Jaspar, Maxwell was tried for a variety of
crimes, and sentenced to the
penitentiary for ten years.</p>
            <p>Dr. Vaudelier, accompanied by Dalhousie and his wife, removed to
New Orleans, where they
spent many happy years, devoted to those pure principles of truth and
justice which the events of
our history contributed not a little to create and strengthen.</p>
            <p>Vernon,—or, as he has changed his character, we may venture
to change his
name,—Jerome Vaudelier, went to California in the first of the
excitement; where, amid
the temptations of that new and dissolute land, he yet maintains the
integrity he vowed to cherish
on the night of the attack upon Cottage Island.</p>
            <pb n="312"/>
            <p>Uncle Nathan and Pat Fegan spent a few days at Bellevue, and then
started for the
North. The honest yeoman, either on account of the many adventures
they had passed through
together, or because Pat was a true convert of his, had taken quite a
fancy to the Hibernian, and
insisted that he should accompany him home. Pat became a very worthy
man, after abandoning
the "critter," which had been his greatest bane. For three years he
served our New Englander
faithfully on the farm, at the end of which period his desire to get
ahead prompted him to take a
buxom Irish girl to his bosom, and go to farming on his own hook. A
visit of Henry and Emily,
about this time, to the worthy farmer, contributed to forward this
end; for Pat, with Celtic candor
and boldness, stated to them his views and purposes. Before the
heiress left, Pat's farm was
bought and paid for, besides being well stocked, by her princely
liberality.</p>
            <p>Jerry Swinger and his wife, who had rendered such important
services to Emily, were not
forgotten. The honest woodman disdained to receive compensation for
any service he or his good
wife had rendered; but Emily found a way to render them comfortable
for life, without any
sacrifice of pride on their part.</p>
            <p>One year after the events which close our history the great
mansion at Bellevue was the
scene of gay festivities. Dr. Vaudelier and his daughter, and
Dalhousie, and Jerry Swinger and all
his family, were there, because, in the hour of its owner's greatest
happiness, she could not be
without those who had been her friends in the season of adversity.
All the country round was
there,—New Orleans was there,—everybody was there, to
witness the nuptials of
the fair heiress and the gallant Captain Carroll.</p>
            <p>The great drawing-room was brilliantly illuminated. The happy
couple entered the room, and
stood up before Mr. Faxon. A step behind Emily, watching the
proceedings with as much interest
as a fond father would witness the espousal of a beloved daughter,
stood Hatchie. Race and<pb n="313"/>
condition did not exclude him from the proud and brilliant assemblage that had
gathered to honor the nuptials of his mistress.</p>
            <p>They were married, and, ere the good minister had concluded his
congratulations, the huge
yellow palm of the faithful slave was extended to receive the
white-gloved hand of the bride. Nor
did she shrink from him. With a sweet smile, and a look which told
how deep were her respect
and admiration, she gave him her hand, heedless of the proud circle
which had gathered around
her to be first in their offering of good wishes.</p>
            <p>"God bless you, Miss Emily! Bless you!" said he, and the tear
stole into his eye, as he
withdrew from the crowd.</p>

                  <p>"MR. B. B. MUSSEY—DEAR SIR—I
have
examined the new publication which has lately come from your press, called the
'OPERA CHORUS BOOK,' and do not hesitate to commend its design and
execution. The Selections are well made and well arranged, and are,
almost all of
them, gems of high musical value. The field from which they were gathered, has
not, until now, been explored. It is rich in fruits, and it is to be
hoped, that such
success may attend this first gathering, as to induce the reapers
again to try the
sickle."</p>

                  <p>"On every page
there is evidence of much patience, care, and industry, on the part of
the Editors, and we question if among all the volumes of Secular
Music that have been
published in this country, there will be found one that has more real
claims to the
admiration of the musical public than this. The Work abounds in those
delicious gems of
the Opera, any one of which is beautiful enough to tempt our readers

                  <p>"BOSTON, DEC. 29TH, 1847.</p>
                  <p>"GENTLEMEN,—Having
examined, with some care, the
'OPERA CHORUS BOOK,' of which you are the publishers, I cheerfully give you
my opinion of its particular merits. As the study and practice of<pb n="3"/>
Secular
Part Music has been pursued with increased zeal and success, within a
few years,
it has been a leading object to find accessible advanced works of a
good character.
The practice of the old standard Glees, however excellent, has lost
its novelty, and
some of its interest. A higher grade of compositions has been required; and the
graceful and charming choruses of the modern Opera have given an increasing
desire for that class of compositions.</p>
                  <p>"In selecting from the
standard works of the day, a knowledge of the
requirements of performers, and a good judgment as to what shall meet these
requirements, were imperative. The collection of the OPERA CHORUS BOOK
has been made with good discretion, combining what is in advance of the current
standard, and, at the same time, affording to social parties, for
which it seems to
be particularly prepared, the easy means of studying gems of some of the best
masters.</p>
                  <p>"Whatever motive of ambition or interest suggested the
idea of this
Collection, the Book is exactly what is wanted at this time; and it
will be taken as
a favor to the musical public, inasmuch as it cannot fail to be a
great acquisition
for practice, and a means of creating a better taste. A book got at
with such good
properties, cannot fail to be well received."</p>

                  <p>"We have examined this Work,
and do not hesitate to recommend it to all who are
desirous of obtaining a useful book. The Elements of Music are
arranged in the most
natural and convenient order for the use of Singing Schools and
Private Classes. After a
few Introductory Remarks, the Scale is introduced to the learner, and
explained in the
author's peculiarly plain and happy style. Next in order is the
Staff, Clefs, Notes, Rests,
&amp;c. The whole Work is regularly laid out in the most
comprehensive form, illustrated
with appropriate Remarks and Examples. The Examples on the
transposition of the scale,
are the most plain and the easiest for the pupil to understand of any
we have ever seen.
The Book also contains about one hundred and twenty pages of Music,
'designed for the
use of Public and Private Schools.' Teachers of Music will find this
a very useful
text-book, as it will enable them to go through with the Elementary
department of
instruction in one half of the time which it usually
requires."—<title>World of Music.</title>
