            <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
            <p>THE giant clock on the wall in the assembly-room
of Madam Truxton's fashionable school had
marked the hour for dismission.</p>
            <p>Groups of restless, anxious pupils stood about the
apartment, or were gathered at the windows, watching
the rain that had been falling in copious showers since
morning. All were eager to go, yet none dared brave
the storm.</p>
            <p>Under the stone archway of the entrance to the
assembly-hall, a group of four maidens stood chatting,
apart from the rest, watching the rain, and impatient
for its cessation.</p>
            <p>"I know my father will either send my brother, or
come for me himself," said Helen Le Grande, "so I
need not fear the rain." Then, turning to the soft-eyed
Jewess who stood by her side, she added, "When the
carriage comes, Leah, you can take a seat with me.
I'll see that you are safely deposited at home."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, Helen, but it won't hurt me to
walk. Nothing hurts me—Leah Mordecai the despised." Then, 
averting her face, the young girl gazed<pb n="4"/>
abstractedly into the street, and began humming in
a low tone.</p>
            <p>To these words of the young Jewess there was no
reply. A certain sort of emphasis in her utterance
seemed to forbid any inquiry, and silence any word of
censure that might arise to the lips of her companions.</p>
            <p>"How mean of me, not to offer a seat in the carriage to 
Lizzie Heartwell, too," thought Helen after a
moment's reflection; "but I dared not, on account of
my brother, who has so repeatedly urged me to make
equals only of the rich. He little knows how I love
Lizzie Heartwell, and whether she be rich or poor I
know not, neither do I care."</p>
            <p>"I say, girls," at length broke the silence, as the
fourth member of the group, Bertha Levy, a Jewess
too, spoke out, "think how stupid I am. Mamma
has promised me a small tea-party to-morrow night, and
this wretched rain had well-nigh caused me to forget it;
but, thank fortune, it's giving way a little, and maybe
we shall all get home after awhile. I'm desperately
hungry! Of course, you will all promise me to come,
and I shall expect you." Then, turning to Helen, she
said, "Won't you?"</p>
            <p>Helen assented.</p>
            <p>"And you, Leah?"</p>
            <p>"I will if I can. I am never sure of my movements, however."</p>
            <p>"And you, dear Lizzie?"</p>
            <p>"With the permission of my uncle and aunt; at
any rate, I thank you for your kindness."</p>
            <p>"Well, I shall expect you every one, and—"</p>
            <p>"There comes the carriage," shouted Helen, as the<pb n="5"/>
liveried coach of the wealthy judge rolled round the
corner, and drove up in front of the spacious school-building. 
"I knew my father would not forget me—yes,
there is my brother."</p>
            <p>The horses, thoroughly wet, looked dark and sleek
as greyhounds, as they stood impatiently stamping the
paving-stones, while a visible cloud of vapor rose from
each distended nostril.</p>
            <p>The coach door opened, and Emile Le Grande, with
handsome, manly figure clad in a gray military suit,
and equally handsome face, stepped out, and approached
the group so impatiently watching the progress of the
storm.</p>
            <p>"Good morning, Miss Mordecai; I am happy that
we meet again," said the gentleman, politely bowing.</p>
            <p>"Thank you, sir; but your presence rather surprises us," replied Leah.</p>
            <p>"I trust, though, I am not an unwelcome intruder
upon this fair group?"</p>
            <p>"Allow me to remind you, my brother, that my
friends, Miss Heartwell and Miss Levy, are also present," said Helen rather reproachfully.</p>
            <p>Emile acknowledged the reproof and the courtesy
with an apology and a smile, and then added, "To
Miss Mordecai's charms I owe the breach of politeness."</p>
            <p>Leah's face flushed crimson, and her eye sparkled
more brightly than ever at these flattering words of
the young cadet; but she made no reply.</p>
            <p>"Come, Helen, let's go," at length said the brother.
"The horses are impatient. Cæsar is wet, and I guess
you are tired, too." Then, turning to Leah, he continued, 
"Miss Mordecai, will you honor us with your<pb n="6"/>
company till we reach your father's house, where I
pledge myself to deposit you safely?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes, Leah will go; I have already asked her,"
said Helen. Then, after a moment's preparation,
the two young friends stepped into the carriage.</p>
            <p>"Good-by again, girls," said Bertha Levy gayly, as 
the coach door closed; "riding <emph>is</emph> rather better than
walking, such a day as this. Remember to-morrow
night." Then, with a dash, the carriage was out of
sight.</p>
            <p>"Well, Lizzie," resumed Bertha, smiling significantly, 
for she could not but observe Helen's manifest
preference in offering Leah a seat with her, "we need
not stand here any longer. I see that the rain, out of
consideration for us, is about to cease, and I don't think
any coach is coming for me. Do you expect one?"</p>
            <p>To this characteristic remark, Lizzie Heartwell 
replied smilingly, "I guess, Bertha, with umbrellas,
overshoes, and care, we can reach home without serious
damage."</p>
            <p>"But care is not a coach, you know, my friend, no
matter how we turn it," said Bertha laughingly, as she
donned the wrapping and overshoes. "I am as hungry as a wolf, 
and I fear mamma will let that young
brother of mine eat all my dinner, if I am too slow in 
getting there. Boys are perfect cormorants, anyhow.
Come, let's go at once."</p>
            <p>The two girls stepped out into the slippery street, 
and turned their faces homeward. "I am glad, Lizzie," continued Bertha, 
as they turned corner after 
corner, "that our paths run together so far; having 
company is so much better than being alone this forlorn <pb n="7"/>
afternoon. And remember, I desire to know the answer to my 
invitation as early as possible. To-morrow
is my brother Isaac's confirmation day, and we must
all be promptly at the synagogue at nine o'clock."</p>
            <p>"You shall know to-night, Bertha, and I will be
with you, if possible. But here, before we part, let's
stop and buy some bananas of old Maum Cinda. She
is always so grateful for a fivepence dropped by a
school-girl."</p>
            <p>By this time the two girls were standing in front
of the well-known fruit-stall of the old blind colored
woman known far and near through the Queen City
as "Maum Cinda." For years, hers had been the
important market for supplying the school-children
with luscious fruits, unimpeachable taffy, and ground-pea candy.</p>
            <p>"An' bless de Lord, is it Miss Lizzie?" said the 
good-natured woman, as the sound of Lizzie Heartwell's voice 
fell upon her ear in the kindly spoken salutation.</p>
            <p>"An' w'at will you have to-day, chile?"</p>
            <p>"Some bananas, Maum Cinda—two for me, and
two for my friend here, Miss Bertha Levy."</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes, Miss Bertha," replied the woman, courtesying, "an' maybe I
have seen Miss Bertha, but it's
the sweet voice of Miss Lizzie that the old blind woman
remembers"—handing the bananas across the wide
board that protected her tempting wares from public
incursions.</p>
            <p>"You flatter me, Maum Cinda; but I hope the
rainy day has not interfered much with your trade.
Here"—and extending her slender white hand, Lizzie<pb n="8"/>
dropped the jingling pennies into the aged, wrinkled
one that opened to receive them.</p>
            <p>"God bless you, chile. You neber forget His poor   
ones, de blind. God bless you!"</p>
            <p>"Good morning, Maum Cinda."</p>
            <p>"Good-by, young ladies, good-by." And the last 
glimpse the two receding friends had of the old woman,
she was still profoundly bowing and courtesying in 
acknowledgment of their remembrance.</p>
            <p>Then the friends parted for the day, each one 
taking the most direct course to her home, and soon
both were safely sheltered from the drizzling rain
and chilling wind.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <p>TWO pale lilies and two royal roses upon a stem,
would scarcely form a more beautiful or striking
group than did the four maidens standing together
under the stone archway of the school-room, on that
gloomy day at Madam Truxton's.</p>
            <p>The fair hair and blue eyes of Helen Le Grande
and Lizzie Heartwell distinctly contrasted with the
jetty locks and eyes of Bertha Levy and Leah Mordecai—the 
beauty of neither style being in any degree
marred by such close contact.</p>
            <p>The blonde beauty of the first two maidens bespoke
their unmistakable Anglo-Norman blood and Christian
descent, while the opposite cast of the others testified
to their Jewish origin.</p>
            <p>A casual observer even, would have decided that
these four maidens were bound together by an unusual
bond of friendship—an incongruous friendship it
might have seemed, and yet it was not such.</p>
            <p>Helen Le Grande, the eldest of the group by a few
months, was scarcely eighteen years of age, as bright and
gay a maiden as one could find in all the land, and the
only daughter of Judge Le Grande, a lawyer of wealth
and distinction.</p>
            <p>Of immediate French descent, Judge Le Grande possessed in 
an eminent degree the peculiarities of his gay,<pb n="10"/>
volatile ancestry. Proud of his children, and ambitious
for their future, in his lavish bounty he withheld nothing
he deemed necessary for their advancement in life.</p>
            <p>Thus at eighteen, Helen Le Grande looked out
upon life's opening sky as thoughtlessly as she would
look upon the bright waters of the blue harbor that
stretched before her father's mansion, where sky and
water blended in a peaceful, azure expanse, little heeding or caring 
whether storms came, or sunshine rested
on the deep. Bertha Levy, the little darked-eyed Jewess
who stood by her side under the stone archway, was nothing more or less 
than a piquant little maiden, just turned
seventeen, of amiable disposition and affectionate heart,
but by no means partial to study, and always ready to
glean surreptitiously from her books, any scraps of the
lesson that might be useful, either to herself or her
friends, in the ordeal of recitation.</p>
            <p>Bertha's mother was a widow, whose circumstances
allowed her children all the comforts and even many
luxuries of life. She had reared them most rigidly in
Hebrew faith. Lizzie Girardeau Heartwell, the next
in the fair tableau, was the only member of the group
who was not a native of the Queen City. It is no misstatement of fact 
to say that she was, indeed, the ruling
spirit of Madam Truxton's entire school.</p>
            <p>Dr. Heartwell, Lizzie's father, had lived in a distant
State, and died when she was but a tender child. Her
mother, a descendant of the Huguenots, was herself a
native of the Queen City. But far away from her
native home had Mrs. Heartwell's married life been
spent, and Lizzie's young days, too, had passed in their
quiet uneventful home at Melrose.</p>
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>But at the age of fifteen, and three years prior to
the opening of this story, under the kindly guardianship
of her uncle, Lizzie Heartwell entered the popular
finishing school of Madam Truxton.</p>
            <p>Possessed of noble, heroic blood, and blessed with
love that instilled into her young mind the principles
of a brave, devoted ancestry, it was but natural that
Lizzie Heartwell should exhibit an unusual development of heart 
and mind at a very tender age, and give
early promise of a braver, nobler womanhood, when
Time should set his seal upon her brow.</p>
            <p>Reluctantly the heart turns to read the half-written
history in the sad face of Leah Mordecai, the fourth
maiden standing pictured against the stone under the
archway. She was of the unmistakable Jewish type,
possessing the contour of face, the lustrous eye, the
massive crown of hair, that so often distinguish and
beautify the Hebrew maiden, wheresoever the sun may
rise and set.</p>
            <p>In the sadness that rested upon this young girl's
face, one might dimly detect the half-extinguished
flame of hope, that usually burns so brilliantly in the
hearts of most young girls. But why this sadness no
one could tell. Its cause was a mystery even to her
friends. Benjamin Mordecai was an opulent banker,
who for many years lived in solitary grandeur in his
bachelor home. But in the process of time, he wedded
the gentle Sarah David, and brought her to share with
him his home and fortune.</p>
            <p>Love had led to this marriage, and peace and happiness for a time, 
like sweet angels, seemed to have
come to dwell evermore within the home. But time<pb n="12"/>
brought changes. After the lapse of a year and a half,
the cherished Leah was born, and from that day the
mother's health declined steadily for a twelvemonth,
and then she was laid in the grave.</p>
            <p>As the mother faded, the infant Leah thrived and
flourished, filling the father's heart with anxious, tender love.</p>
            <p>Among the inmates of the Mordecai home from the
time of Mrs. Mordecai's declining health, was a young
woman, Rebecca Hartz, who acted as house-keeper
and general superintendent of domestic affairs. She
had been employed by Mr. Mordecai for this important
position, not so much on account of her competency to
fill it, as to bestow a charity upon her unfortunate
father, who constantly besought employment for his
numerous children, among the more favored of his
people.</p>
            <p>Isaac Hartz was a butcher, whose slender income
was readily exhausted by a burdensome family. Rebecca, 
his daughter, was a good-looking young woman
of twenty at the time she entered Mr. Mordecai's family. 
Although coarse and ill-bred, she was also shrewd
and designing, often making pretence of friendship
and affection to gain her ends when in reality hatred
and animosity were burning in her bosom. Such was
Rebecca Hartz. Such the woman to usurp the household government, 
when the gentle Mrs. Mordecai had
passed away.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <p>IN Mrs. Levy's attractive drawing-room, Bertha's
guests were assembled for the tea-party.</p>
            <p>Lizzie Heartwell, the first to arrive, was ushered
into the brightly lighted room, to find Mrs. Levy the
only occupant.</p>
            <p>"I welcome you gladly, Miss Heartwell," said Mrs.
Levy, rising and taking Lizzie by the hand. "I have
long desired your acquaintance, knowing my daughter's friendship 
for you. Pray be seated."</p>
            <p>"I thank you, Mrs. Levy," replied Lizzie, "I indeed
esteem it an honor to meet the mother of such a friend
as Bertha."</p>
            <p>"My daughter will be present by and by. I regret that necessity 
compels her non-appearance as yet.
Sit nearer the fire."</p>
            <p>Lizzie drew closer to the glowing grate, and they
continued a pleasant conversation till Bertha appeared.</p>
            <p>"What a handsome woman!" thought Lizzie, as
she occasionally surveyed Mrs. Levy from head to foot
during the tête-à-tête.</p>
            <p>And she was a handsome womam, dressed quietly
but richly in black satin, her head adorned only by the
clustering curls she had worn from her girlhood.
There was little change even in their arrangement, and<pb n="14"/>
only an occasional thread of silver here and there bespoke the touch of time. 
Her eyes were still beautiful,
but their lustre had been dimmed by the tears of her
widowhood.</p>
            <p>Bertha bore the same cast of beauty that distinguished her
mother, yet time's developing, modelling work for her was not 
yet completed. When the
guests were duly assembled, Bertha approached her
mother, who was still entertaining Lizzie, appearing
quite fascinated with her daughter's friend, and said,
"Mother, won't you release your prisoner now?
Helen Le Grande wishes her to join the group over
there by the window, in a game of euchre."</p>
            <p>"Certainly, my dear. I trust Miss Heartwell will
pardon me if I have detained her too long."</p>
            <p>"Come, Lizzie, come along," said Bertha; and then
added, in an undertone, "you know what I promised
to show you, Lizzie. Come with me; let them make
up the game without you."</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes, that album; show it to me," said Lizzie,
following Bertha to a well-filled étagère, from which
she took a handsomely bound album, saying, "This
is from Asher. Isn't it lovely?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed it is," replied Lizzie.</p>
            <p>"Mamma says I do not know who sent it to me, as
there is no name anywhere. She does not wish me to
think it's from Asher, but I know it is. It's just like
him to do such nice things," and, bending her head
closer to Lizzie, Bertha continued, "you see, Lizzie,
I am awfully disappointed because mamma would not
allow me to invite him here to-night. I am just as
vexed as I well can be."</p>
            <pb n="15"/>
            <p>"Won't some of these other gentlemen answer in
his stead?" asked Lizzie, smiling.</p>
            <p>"Bosh! no; all of these, and forty more, are not
equal to Asher Bernhardt, in my estimation. I love
Asher, I tell you, and I mean to marry him, one of
these days; do you hear me?"</p>
            <p>"Marry! how you talk! A girl of your age presuming to 
say that you will marry such and such a
one," said Lizzie, laughing.</p>
            <p>"Indeed! I consider myself woman enough to decide whom I like, 
better than any one else, whether
you call that old enough to marry, or not. But let
me tell you what mamma said to-day, when she caught
me kissing the album. 'Bertha Levy'—and oh!
she looked so straight and solemn at me that I almost
trembled—'Bertha Levy, are you going to make
yourself ridiculous about that strolling player, Asher
Bernhardt? Tell me.' 'You know he plays the
flute superbly, and that's what I like.' Then I
said meekly:</p>
            <p>"'I know that he loves me.'</p>
            <p>"'You know nothing of that sort, and you are a very
silly girl. This is the way you regard my teachings,
is it, fancying strolling players at private theatricals?
What! could you promise yourself to marry such a
man—a man whose chief recomendation is, that he
can play the flute?'</p>
            <p>"'Happiness,' I whispered.</p>
            <p>"'Wretchedness, you mean! Well, I forbid you ever
thinking of him again. I shall never, never, consent to
such a thing, never while I am your mother. Remember my words now!'</p>
            <pb n="16"/>
            <p>"Oh! Lizzie, wasn't that awful, mamma is so hard
on him! I—"</p>
            <p>"Bertha, Bertha!" called a voice from the opposite
side of the room, which Bertha at once recognized as her
mother's and immediately turned toward Mrs. Levy,
leaving Lizzie standing alone.</p>
            <p>"For shame, my daughter!" said Mrs. Levy, in a
low tone to Bertha, "to keep Miss Heartwell standing talking 
all the evening about your supposed present
from Asher Bernhardt! I shall not allow you company
again until you improve in politeness, and I will destroy
that cherished book. Do you hear me? Go at once
and see that Miss Heartwell is seated."</p>
            <p>Bertha bowed her head, in token of obedience,
and as she turned back to join Lizzie, Leah Mordecai
was approaching the piano, accompanied by Emile
Le Grande.</p>
            <p>Leah Mordecai was a superb singer, yet it was only
at the request of friends that her soul flowed forth in
song. On this evening her music was delicious, and
Emile Le Grande, always fond of the divine art, was
bewitched with the beauty of her voice. When her
singing ceased, the sadness still rested upon her face,
and in Emile's heart there was a new-born sensation—that
of pleasure mingled with fear.</p>
            <p>The evening hours wore on. The hours that bore
away the Jewish Sabbath were rolling in the Christian day of rest, 
and Lizzie Heartwell, in obedience
to her uncle's request not to "tarry at her pleasure
too late," was the first to separate from the happy
band.</p>
            <p>An hour later, as the Citadel clock sounded the<pb n="17"/>
hour of midnight, Judge Le Grande's carriage rolled
rapidly toward the mansion of Benjamin Mordecai,
bearing home his beautiful daughter, escorted by
Emile Le Grande.</p>
            <p>This night, as Lizzie Heartwell was slowly disrobing for 
the remaining hours of slumber after her return home, she 
glanced into the small mirror before
her, and thought audibly—"Emile Le Grande seemed
quite charmed to-night with Leah; he hung around her
like a shadow, and part of the evening he seemed
moody and almost miserable. How strange if he
should fall in love with her! She's a grand girl. I
don't think she could fancy Emile Le Grande. I
wonder why Leah called herself 'the despised' yesterday. Well, we shall see."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Levy's guests had departed, one by one, till
the mother and daughter were left alone in the deserted room.</p>
            <p>"Mamma," Bertha said at length, shrugging her
dainty figure, and gazing thoughtfully into the fire,
"I do believe that Emile Le Grande is in love with
Leah Mordecai, and she with him."</p>
            <p>"Be ashamed, Bertha, to think of such a thing!
I believe you are insane on the subject of love. Have
you forgotten that she is a Mordecai."</p>
            <p>"Oh! Love's love, mamma, Mordecai or not Mordecai!
I think Emile Le Grande a fine fellow."</p>
            <p>"Would you be impudent, Bertha?" said her
mother, eyeing her sharply.</p>
            <p>"Oh! not for the world, mamma. Do forgive me,
if you think so, and let us retire, for I have an awful
task of study awaiting me to-morrow."</p>

            <head type="sub">EMILE LE GRANDE'S DIARY.</head>
            <p>"SATURDAY night—by Jove! <emph>Sunday morning</emph>,
I suppose I should write it, to be strictly
truthful. And I guess that orthodox people would
roll their pious eyes, and declare that I had better be in
bed at this hour, instead of writing in my journal.
But it makes no difference. I do not know whether
it's the seventh or the first day that I should observe
as a day of rest. One suits me as well as the other. 
So here goes for my journal.</p>
            <p>"<hi>November</hi> 29, Saturday night. Yes, I'll write 
Saturday night, for the looks of the thing. Just returned from 
Bertha Levy's tea-party—went with my
sister. Would not have gone but for the hope of meeting Leah Mordecai. 
In the main, I hate Jews, but I
must admit here, Journal, that Mrs. Levy is as elegant
a woman as I have ever met; and Bertha, too, is a cunning creature, 
not beautiful and not my fancy exactly,
but withal a taking girl.</p>
            <p>"But of all the beautiful women that I have seen 
in years, Jewish or Christian, there's not one can compare with 
Leah Mordecai—such hair and such eyes are
seldom given to woman. Helen says that her hair
measures four feet in length! What a queenly poise
to that elegant head!</p>
            <pb n="19"/>
            <p>"But I swear there's a sadness about her face that
I do not comprehend. She certainly knows nothing of
sorrow. It does not arise from want; for she, of all
maidens in this Queen City, is farthest from that.
Old Ben Mordecai has untold wealth, and there comes
in the 'marrow of the nut.' Of course, he is as
stingy as a Jew can be; but not with his daughter.
Who has more elegant silks, velvets, and diamonds
than she? Rich! rich! Ha! what a glorious thing to
be said of one; but aside from old Mordecai's money,
Leah is a superb woman; one need never be ashamed
of such a wife. I should not be.</p>
            <p>"I must set myself to work to ascertain the trouble
that must dwell in her heart so constantly to becloud
her face. I'll bribe Helen to find out for me. It
may be some unfortunate love affair—who knows? I
think I would like to put any fellow out of the way
that might be seeking her hand. I believe I would
<emph>kill</emph> him, if necessary. Perhaps, dear Journal, I should
not have written that terrible monosyllable, but as you
tell no tales, I'll let it stand.</p>
            <p>"Now, I must to bed, and sleep, if I can—sleep
away some of the tedious hours that lie between me
and another sight of the fair Leah.</p>
            <p>"Already the clock strikes two."</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>"And Mark was not there to-night, as I had hoped
and expected," sighed Leah, as she stood before the
elegant dressing-case of her bed-chamber, and laid
aside the articles of her toilet, after the revel was
done. "Only another disappointment! And yet, I 
know that Bertha invited him, and lie promised me to<pb n="20"/>
attend. I should not have worn these ear-rings and this
brooch, which were my mother's, had I known Mark
would have been absent. Oh, my angel mother!"</p>
            <p>A tear stole slowly down her face, and fell upon
the shining pearls that she still clasped between her
fingers. "Why did not the grave cover us both? Why
was I left alone and so desolate in the world? Can it
be that Mark has deceived me—Mark Abrams, the
only friend in the world that I implicitly trust? God
only knows. I remember now, how he looked at my
mother—what mockery to call that woman mother!—when
I asked him if he would attend the tea-party.
I remember furthermore, that she followed him to the
door after he bade us adieu; and what words she may
have let slip there, Heaven only knows! I have had
a lurking suspicion for some time, that she was planning to 
win Mark's love from me, and secure it for my
sister Sarah. What if she should succeed. Oh! how
wretched I should be! It has been a year, nearly,
since Mark and I secretly pledged our love, and he
promised then that we should be married soon
after I finished at Madam Truxton's. How fondly
I have looked forward to that coming day! It has
been the one single hope of my miserable life; and
now that the time draws so near, is it possible that my
dream must vanish into nothingness? Must this heart
taste the bitterness of deception, among its other sorrows? 
Miserable girl that I am! Surely some evil
star shone over the hour and place of my birth.
But I'll hope on for the best, and still continue to
look forward to the coming day, when my life shall
be separated from the wretched woman who now so<pb n="21"/>
darkly overshadows my existence. I'll hope on, even
though disappointment come at last." The soliloquy
ended, Leah laid away the pearls in the velvet-lined
case, and turned to slumber and dreams.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>Mark Abrams, the early friend and lover of Leah,
was the oldest son of a talented and highly-esteemed
rabbi, who presided over the most flourishing and
wealthy Jewish congregation in the Queen City;
and Mark himself was highly esteemed, as a young
man of unimpeachable integrity and unusual 
brilliancy of intellect.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
            <p>MONDAY morning came again. The great bell
in the cupola of Madam Truxton's seminary had
sounded, and all the pupils, large and small, were gathered 
to join in the opening exercises. First, the bright-eyed
little girls, in tidy aprons, with hair smoothed
back in modest braids, or safely gathered under the
faithful comb; then, the more advanced scholars,
each bearing the impress of healthful vigor and
hopeful heart; and last, the big girls, or "finishing
class," as Madam Truxton significantly styled them—all
were assembled once more on this bright Monday morning, 
to begin the duties of another week, and
share again the joys and sorrows of school life. It
was a lovely sight, this assembled school; for where is
the heart that does not see with unspeakable pleasure
the dawning beauty of innocent, careless maidenhood?</p>
            <p>"Bertha, do you know the French lesson?" said
Lizzie Heartwell, as the class of young ladies was
passing from the assembly hall to Madam Condé's
room.</p>
            <p>"Oh, just well enough, Lizzie, to keep me from a 
scolding, I guess. Here, won't you please hold the
book open at aimer, so I can get that muss a little
straight, in case madam calls upon me to conjugate?"</p>
            <p>Lizzie laughed.</p>
            <pb n="23"/>
            <p>"Oh, pshaw! of course you won't. Lizzie Heartwell, 
you are too conscientious; but Helen, you will,
won't you?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, if you will hold it open for me, too. I am
not at all prepared in the lesson."</p>
            <p>"Here, Leah," continued Bertha, laughing, and
winking her roguish eyes at Lizzie, "how much do
you know of the verb aimer?"</p>
            <p>"More than I wish I did," was the laconic reply
of the beautiful Jewess.</p>
            <p>"I suppose so, judging from what I saw on last
Saturday evening. But here we are at the lion's den,
and our levity had better subside."</p>
            <p>"Bon jour, madame!"</p>
            <p>"Bon jour, mesdemoiselles."</p>
            <p>And the door was closed.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>At this same hour, in the large, hollow square
fronting the Citadel Tower in the upper part of the
Queen City, many platoons of young men, dressed in
the gray military suits of the cadets, were drilling,
drilling, drilling, according to custom, as a part of
their daily school routine.</p>
            <p>A passer-by would have stopped for a moment,
and watched with interest this pleasing spectacle.
The varied and intricate evolutions made by these
gray-clad figures, as they expanded into broad platoons,
and then, as if by magic, fell again into groups of two,
four, or six, was, to the unaccustomed beholder, a
strange and attractive performance.</p>
            <p>The bristling bayonets shining in the bright
morning sun, gave evidence of the faithful care with<pb n="24"/>
with which their polish was preserved. And these
bright polished muskets spoke loudly too, to the
reflecting heart, of the wild work they might some
day accomplish, when carried into the conflict by these
same skilful hands that now so peacefully upheld
them—demon-work, that might clothe a land and
people in sackcloth and desolation!</p>
            <p>The drilling was ended, the last evolution made,
the halt commanded, and the order to disband spoken.</p>
            <p>Like a fragile piece of potter's work, the magic ranks
broke apart, and each gun fell to the ground with a
heavy "thud," like an iron weight.</p>
            <p>"I say, George, I am deuced tired of this turning
and twisting, and I'll be glad when the term ends, and
I am set free from this place."</p>
            <p>"Well, I can't say that I will, Le Grande," replied
George Marshall, as handsome a cadet as wore the
uniform, and one highly ambitious for promotion. "I
came to this institute, because I was always fascinated
by military display, and I intend to make this my lifelong profession."</p>
            <p>"Whew! how tired I am! Well, you are welcome to it. 
As for me, it's the last life I should choose.
I like the uniform very well, especially when I go
where the girls are—they always give a cadet's suit a
second glance—but as for the 'profession of arms,' as
you call it, excuse me."</p>
            <p>"What! would you like, Le Grande, always to be
playing lady's man?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes; and that reminds me, George, that I
have a new lady-love; she is at Madam Truxton's.
To-day, at intermission, let's saunter down to the <orig>sem-</orig>
               <pb n="25"/>
inary, and catch a glimpse of the girls. Maybe I'll
see her."</p>
            <p>"I can't; at intermission I must study my Legendre. 
Look at the clock now; it's late."</p>
            <p>"Bother the Legendre! you are the strangest fellow I ever saw—care 
no more for the girls than a
'cat does for holidays.' Won't you go?"</p>
            <p>"Not to-day, Le Grande. I am very busy."</p>
            <p>The clock struck nine, and George Marshall, with
the other disbanded cadets, hurried to the duties of
the day—to the hard task of study that awaited them
within the grim walls of the citadel.</p>
            <p>For a moment before turning to his books, George
Marshall looked out of the window, far away to the
blue, misty harbor. There he saw again old Fort Defiance, 
standing grim, stern, and dark against the
morning sky—the only object that marred the brightness 
of the blue heaven and the blue water, melting
together in the distance.</p>
            <p>"How beautiful the harbor is to-day! And yet
how sullen the fort looks," said the young cadet as he
surveyed the scene. "I see the flag of my country
floating, and all is peaceful and quiet in the waters.
Thank God for such a country! But I must hasten
to my duties."</p>

Your melancholy look distresses me. Is it any

            <p>These lines Lizzie Heartwell slipped into the leaves
of a book that lay upon Leah's desk, while she was
absent at a music recitation.</p>
            <p>By and by the bell sounded for the half hour's
release from study. Then Leah stepped across the
room, and gently taking Lizzie by the arm, said,
"Come, let's walk."</p>
            <p>Lizzie put her arm around her friend, and the two
girls walked out into the court-yard, that formed a
play-ground for the younger scholars and a pleasant
promenade for the older ones, and then turned aside
upon the brick walk that connected the kitchen and
servants' hall with the main building.</p>
            <p>This brick walk, covered overhead by the piazza
floor of the second story of the wing of the building,
was securely protected in all kinds of weather. As Leah
and Lizzie turned upon this promenade, Bertha Levy
came skipping up to them with a merry bound, saying:</p>
            <p>"Come girls, let's have a game of graces. Helen is
willing. Here she is. What do you say?"</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p>"Excuse me this morning, Bertha," Leah replied.
"I do not feel well; my head aches, and perhaps I can
walk it away!"</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes, certainly; but you are as solemn as an
owl, of late, Leah; what is the matter with you? Do
you contemplate taking the veil? If so, is it the
white or the black veil?"</p>
            <p>"Our people never take the veil, Bertha. Do you
forget?" replied Leah reproachfully.</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, dear, I meant no harm. But I am
in a hurry. Dame Truxton will have that old bell
sounded directly, and my game of graces not even
begun. I wish the old thing was still in its native
ore, and not always ready to call us into trouble;" and
so saying, Bertha skipped away, calling, "Here, Mag
Lawton, Mary Pinckney, come and play graces."</p>
            <p>For a moment Lizzie and Leah stood watching the
group as it formed, and admiring the graceful movements 
of the hoops as they flew from the fairylike
wands of the girls. "That game is well called," said
Lizzie, as Leah caught her arm again and said:</p>
            <p>"Come, let's walk on." Then, after a pause, she
continued, "I found your note, Lizzie, and I am sorry
that I have such a telltale face; but I am unhappy,
Lizzie; yes, I am miserable, and I cannot conceal it.
I would not obtrude my sorrow upon others, but it is
my face and not my tongue that betrays me."</p>
            <p>"Do not think, Leah, I beg you, that I would seek
to pry into the secret of your heart," responded Lizzie;
"but I thought if you were in trouble, maybe I might
in some way comfort you."</p>
            <p>"I thank you, dear, dear Lizzie, for your sympathy"<pb n="28"/>
—and a tear fell from the lustrous lashes of the Jewess; 
"I thank you again and again," she continued,
"but nothing you can do can alleviate my sorrow."</p>
            <p>"Well, you can trust me for sympathy and love
always, whether that will comfort you or not, Leah; be
your trouble what it may."</p>
            <p>"Mine is no sudden grief, Lizzie; it is a long, sad
story, one that I have never felt at liberty to inflict
upon any one's hearing, and yet, I have always found
you so tender and so true, that when any additional
sorrow comes to me my heart strangely turns to
you for sympathy. I know not why. Can you tell
me?"</p>
            <p>"We always turn to those who love us, I think, in
hours of darkness."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Lizzie, but there is a peculiar yearning, in
my heart for you, at times. I imagine it's akin to
the feeling I should have for my mother, were she
living. With this feeling at my heart, I long to look
upon my mother's miniature which I once had, but
which is now in my step-mother's possession, and to
gaze upon the face that speaks such love to me, though
her voice has so long been silent."</p>
            <p>Lizzie, touched at Leah's pathetic words, turned
and looked at her friend with a tender glance, and said,
"Trust me, Leah, for that sympathy which you from
some cause need, and unburden your aching heart to
me, if you choose."</p>
            <p>"But, there! the bell is ringing and we must go,"
said Leah abruptly. "Let's meet after school in the
upper corridor, that overlooks the sea. I have something further to say to you."</p>
            <pb n="29"/>
            <p>"If you wish, dear Leah; and it's but a short two
hours till dismission. Let's go."</p>
            <p>Cloaked and hooded, the school-girls were all ready
for departure after the three long, welcome strokes of
the great clock; when Leah said, "It's growing chilly,
Lizzie. Wrap your shawl closely around you, for it's
cold out on the corridor. Come, let's go out at the rear
door before it is locked."</p>
            <p>Ascending a spiral staircase, the two girls reached
the upper corridor that ran across the south side of
the end wing of the building.</p>
            <p>"Suppose Madam Truxton should come upon us,
Lizzie, what would she think?" said Leah, as the two
girls crouched down closer together at the end of the
corridor.</p>
            <p>"Nothing wrong, I guess, as we have our books;
and perhaps we had better look over our French a
minute. What do you say?"</p>
            <p>"So we had, as it comes first in the morning," and
bending their heads together the girls were silent for
a time, pretending to study. At length Lizzie closed
the book, and Leah began her story.</p>

sad story of my life to you; and yet, I am impelled to
do so by this hunger for sympathy that is so constantly 
gnawing at my heart. As I have told you before, my heart 
strangely turns to you in sorrow. In the

each other daily, I have never known you guilty of a
single act or word that was unworthy—"</p>

story now, though it shall be briefly told; and I have
one request to make, my dear. It is, that you have
charity for my faults, and pity for me in my many
temptations." She continued:</p>
            <p>"As you have known before, my mother died when
I was a very little child, scarcely three years old. I
remember her but very indistinctly. The woman who
is now my father's wife, was his housekeeper in my
mother's life-time. She, of course, came from the
common walks of life, her father being a very poor
butcher. How she ever became my father's wife, I
do not know; but my old nurse used to intimate to
me that it was by no honorable means. Be that as it
may, he married her when I was four years of age; and
from that date my miserable story begins. The first
incident of my life after this second marriage which I
remember most vividly was this. A year after my
father's marriage to Rebecca, business of importance
called him to England, and a long-cherished desire to
see his aged parents took him to Bohemia, where they
lived, after the business in Liverpool was transacted.
How I fared while he was gone, I dimly remember;
but well enough, I suppose, as I was still partially under
the care and control of my faithful nurse, a colored
woman of kind and tender heart.</p>
            <p>"Poor, dear old woman, she is dead long ago!</p>
            <p>"This visit of my father to his parents proved to be
the last, as they died a year or two afterward. Among
my father's relatives in the old country, was a cousin
who lived in wealth and luxury somewhere in Saxony.<pb n="31"/>
This cousin had been as a brother to him in his young
days, and on my father's return from Bohemia, he
passed through Saxony and paid this cousin a visit;
He still speaks occasionally of that delightful event.
I must not forget to tell you that this cousin was a
baron—Baron von Rosenberg. He was not born to the
title; it was conferred on him for some heroic act, the
circumstance of which I do not now remember, during
an insurrection.</p>
            <p>"At parting with my father at the close of his visit,
the Baron made him many costly gifts; among others,
one of an elegant pipe of rare and exquisite workmanship. 
How distinctly I recall it now! It was in the
shape of an elk's head, with spreading, delicately
wrought antlers. The eyes were formed of some kind
of precious stones, and on the face of the elk were the
Baron's initials inlaid in gold.</p>
            <p>"The stem, I remember well, was of ebony, richly
ornamented with gold. I suppose it was a magnificent thing 
of its kind, and prized beyond measure
by my father. He used it only on rare occasions, and
for the gratification of our guests. But at length an
event occurred that called forth the treasured pipe
from its casket, never to be returned. It was on the
occasion of the third anniversary of my father's marriage
to Rebecca Hartz—an occasion that richly deserved
sackcloth and ashes instead of feasting and merriment.
But the day was one of grand demonstration, and
many guests and friends were in attendance. All the
articles of value and luxury belonging to the family
were brought into requisition, and among the number, 
the treasured but ill-fated pipe. The guests ate,<pb n="32"/>
drank, and were merry, I suppose, till all were sated,
and at a late and lonely hour they left my father's
house deserted, with disorder reigning supreme in
every apartment.</p>
            <p>"'Forget not my elk's head, Rebecca,' was my
father's last admonition, as he retired to his bed-chamber, 
after the revel was over.</p>
            <p>"But Rebecca did not heed his command, and being
fatigued herself, hurriedly retired, saying, 'I'll wait
till morning.'</p>
            <p>"Morning came, and unfortunately for me, I was
the first to awaken. Hastily dressing, I thought I
would explore the scene of the late festivity; and so I
descended the stairs and entered the silent, deserted
drawing-room. In a few moments, Rebecca herself
entered the drawing-room, but partially dressed and
wrapped in a crimson shawl. She had come to remove
the pipe.</p>
            <p>"'Why are you up so early, Leah?' she said confusedly, 
seeing that I was also in the room. And then,
as she passed hurriedly around the table where the
pipe lay, the treacherous fringe of her shawl caught
in the delicate antlers of the elk's head and dragged it
from its place upon the table. It fell to the floor with
a crash, and we both looked down in dismay on the
wreck at her feet. A footstep sounded in the hall at
that moment, and fearing it was my father, Rebecca
said boldly, and with gleaming eye:</p>
            <p>"'What did you do that for, you wretched child?'</p>
            <p>"'Do what?' I whispered, overawed.</p>
            <p>"'Deny it, if you dare, and I'll break every bone in
your body, you lynx! What will your father say?'<pb n="33"/>
she continued. 'Pick up every piece, and go and
show it to him. Say you broke it, and ask his
forgiveness! Do you hear me?'</p>
            <p>"I hesitated and trembled.</p>
            <p>"'Dare you disobey me?' she angrily exclaimed,
with menacing gesture.</p>
            <p>"'I am afraid of my father,' I whispered again,
scarcely knowing whether I really did the mischief
or not.</p>
            <p>"'And well you may be," she continued fearlessly,
seeing that she was gaining the mastery over me;
'but the sooner you seek his forgiveness, the sooner
you will obtain it. Go at once, I tell you.'</p>
            <p>"Oh! pity me, Lizzie! pity me, for from that
fatal moment, I have been the slave, the serf, of a
stronger will—a will that has withered and crushed
out, by slow degrees, the last trace of moral courage
that might have beautified and strengthened my character; 
crushed it out, and left me a cowardly, miserable, helpless girl! But to return.</p>
            <p>"Involuntarily I stooped down, and began to pick
up the pieces of the fragile horns, and the eyes of the
elk's head, that lay scattered around upon the soft carpet, 
really wondering if, indeed, I did break it.</p>
            <p>"'Now you have gathered up the pieces, go at
once to your father; and mind you tell him you broke
it. Do you hear me?'</p>
            <p>"I glided out of the room, away from the presence
of the woman who had so cruelly imposed upon my
helplessness. Trembling with fear, and a sense of my
supposed guilt, I approached my father, who was by<pb n="34"/>
this time comfortably seated in the family sitting-room,
reading the morning paper.</p>
            <p>"I crept to him and held out the fragments.</p>
            <p>"'The d—l to pay! Who broke this?' he almost
shouted in anger.</p>
            <p>"'I did,' I murmured; and the rest of my story
unspoken, my father struck me a blow for the first and
last time in his life. It sent me reeling against a table;
the sharp corner struck my forehead and cut a terrible
gash. Here, I will show it to you. It is plainly visible,
and always will be."</p>
            <p>Leah lifted the glossy dark hair from her smooth
pale forehead, and displayed the long, hard scar, that
was so carefully concealed by the ebon folds. "I
always wear my hair combed to hide it."</p>
            <p>"Oh! Leah, Leah," sighed Lizzie, "how dreadful!"</p>
            <p>"At sight of the blood that flowed freely from the
wound, my father caught me in his arms, and kissing
my blood-stained face, exclaimed again and again:</p>
            <p>"'Fool, wretch, devil, that I am! Not for all the
world would I have shed a drop of this precious blood.
I beg your forgiveness, my darling—a thousand times,
my child!' My cries, though suppressed, brought my
mother to the room. With a well-assumed air of innocence 
and tenderness, she sought to wipe away the
blood from my face, and bind up the gash upon my
forehead. I all the while abstractedly wondering if I
really did break the pipe; such was my weakness, such
the power that was over and around my young life,
and is yet, even to this very hour.</p>
            <p>"My father gathered up the scattered fragments
of the broken treasure and cast them into the fire; and<pb n="35"/>
from that day to this, he has never alluded in any manner 
to that occurrence. Always kind and tender to
me, he seems to be ever endeavoring to atone for some
wrong, and his long-continued silence assures me how
vividly and regretfully he remembers his violence
toward me."</p>
            <p>"Shocking!" ejaculated Lizzie with emotion.</p>
            <p>"Yes, it is shocking, dear Lizzie; for the horrible
truth is ever before me, and this hated scar is the seal
of the first lie of my tender young life. I never comb
my hair away from my face, so morbidly am I impressed with 
the fear that those who see it will read the
cause of its existence. Oh! Lizzie, that falsehood, and
that cruel deception imposed upon a helpless child,
were terrible indeed, too terrible to be borne.</p>
            <p>"But I must proceed. I have dwelt thus minutely
upon this first unhappy incident of my childhood, because 
it is a sort of guide-post to a long and dreary
waste of years. It forms the headstone of my departed freedom, 
for, as I have said, in that evil moment
when I yielded to her wicked, imperious will, I lost all
moral power, and to this day, am worse than her vassal. 
Try as I may, I cannot shake off the habit; it
has become second nature, and her influence now is
so withering that I dare not make resistance; and
yet, I despise myself for my weakness. Pity me,
Lizzie, do not blame me! There's a moral want
about me somewhere, Heaven knows, that no human
agency can supply.</p>
            <p>"My mother's assumed fondness for me led my
father to believe that she loved me truly, and was tender 
and kind as she should be. He never dreamed of<pb n="36"/>
her deception. And to this day, he knows nothing of
it, for I have never told him any of my trials and
sorrows, since the day he struck me that undeserved
blow. I love my father tenderly, and yet I cannot,
dare not, unfold to his blinded vision the facts that
have so long been concealed from him. No, Lizzie, I
would rather suffer on as I must do, than darken his
life by such a discovery.</p>
            <p>"Thus you see something of how the years passed
on. I, a helpless, ill-used orphan, growing older and
and stronger day by day, and yet morally weaker and
weaker, with no will or power of resistance, till I
wonder sometimes that I am not an imbecile indeed.</p>
            <p>"I thank the great God for my school-days. They
have been days of pleasure and benefit to me. They
have taken me from that home where I withered as
the dew withers before the glaring sun, and cast me
among pleasant friends, who seem to love me, and at
least are true and kind. True and kind! Dear Lizzie,
you cannot comprehend the significance of that expression. 
To my starved, wretched heart, these words
are the fulness of all speech. I comprehend their
meaning, and regard them as I do the burning stars
afar, shining dimly upon a darkened world.</p>
            <p>"Yes; again I say, I thank the great God for these
school-days, that led me to know you, Lizzie—you, to
whom my heart has learned to turn as a wounded,
helpless bird would turn to its mother's sheltering
wing for safety and protection."</p>
            <p>Touched by Leah's story, and her protestations of
love, Lizzie bowed her head in her hands, and a few
tears fell through the slender fingers. Observing these<pb n="37"/>
tears, Leah bent forward and kissed them away, saying, 
"These are the first tears I ever saw fall for me."
Then she continued:</p>
            <p>"It is not necessary to dwell on the innumerable
instances of cruelty and wrong that have marked my
life, from the period just mentioned, on to the present.
It is enough to say that many events in my home-life have left
their searing impress on my heart and
brain; and many, I thank God, have faded from my
memory. But when I was fifteen, about the time
you and I entered this seminary, an event took place,
that has deeply wounded my heart, and will leave it 
sore forever. It was this:</p>
            <p>"Very early on the morning of my fifteenth birthday, 
my father came to my chamber and congratulated
me with many kisses, giving me his blessing. Then
he said:</p>
            <p>"'My daughter, I have here the miniature of your
mother, taken before your birth. I had it set in diamonds then, 
for you, my child, little dreaming she
would so soon be taken from us both. I have kept it
securely locked away, waiting till you were old enough
properly to appreciate its value. Now to-day, on your
fifteenth birth-day, I have called forth the treasure,
and give it to you forever. Take it; keep it carefully,
my child, for the sake of the living as well as the dead.'
My father laid the miniature in my hand, and turned
away with ill-disguised emotion. Softly, and with
trembling hand, I opened the casket that contained the
treasure, and for the first time since her death, my
eyes rested upon the dimly remembered features of
my angel mother.</p>
            <pb n="38"/>
            <p>"O Lizzie Heartwell! At the first glimpse of that
sweet, but half-forgotten face, I fell, like a helpless
thing that I was, to the floor, prostrate with emotion.
How long I remained thus overcome by sorrow and
weeping, I know not. I knew nothing till the old
familiar voice, harsh, cold, and cruel, fell upon my ear
as the door opened.</p>
            <p>"'Leah Mordecai, why are you lying there crying
like a booby? What's the matter with you?' said my
mother.</p>
            <p>"Involuntarily I hushed my sobs, dried my tears,
and arose to my feet.</p>
            <p>"'What have you there, baby?' she continued.</p>
            <p>"Without a word I handed her the casket, and as she
regarded the sweet, mild face with cruel scorn, she said:</p>
            <p>"'What's this you are blubbering over? Didn't
you ever see a painted-faced doll before? Who gave
you this?'</p>
            <p>"'My father,' I replied fearfully; 'and it's the picture 
of my mother, my own dear mother that's dead.'</p>
            <p>"My reply seemed to enrage her, and she said, 'The
diamonds are beautiful, but I can't say as much for the
face. I suppose you consider that you have no mother
now; from all this whimpering. See here, Leah,' she
added as a sudden thought seemed to strike her, 'You
are too young to keep such a costly gift as this. I'll
take it, and keep it myself till you have sense enough
to know what diamonds are.'</p>
            <p>"'Give it back to me,' I said excitedly, daring to
hold out my trembling hand.</p>
            <p>"'Indeed I shall not,' she angrily replied, pushing
back the importunate hand.</p>
            <pb n="39"/>
            <p>"'Your father is a fool, to have given a child like
you such a valuable thing as this. I'll see if he gives
my Sarah this many diamonds when she is but a child
of fifteen. And now, mind you, Leah Mordecai,' she
continued, with a triumphant smile upon her wicked
face, 'if you dare tell your father I took this from you,
you'll repent it sorely. Mark my warning; say nothing about 
it unless asked, and then say you gave it to
me for safe keeping.' She dropped the casket into her
dress pocket, and swept coldly out of the room.</p>
            <p>"The door closed behind her, and I was alone in my
misery and my wrath. In my bitterness I cursed the
woman who thus dared to crush a helpless little worm
beneath her wicked foot, and, falling on my face again,
I implored the great God to let me die, to take me to
that mother whom I so deeply mourned.</p>
            <p>"It's growing chilly out here, Lizzie," continued
Leah after a pause; "suppose we leave the corridor,
and find shelter in the hall of the wing. We can sit
in the great window at the end of the hall, overlooking
the sea. There we shall be secure from intrusion."</p>
            <p>Lizzie bowed assent, and after the two girls were
snugly seated in the great window, Leah continued
her story:</p>
            <p>"She has kept the miniature to this day, and for
three long years, no matter how my eyes have longed
for a glimpse of that sweet face, I have never dared to
ask for it. Many times she has worn it, in great state,
in her treacherous bosom, my father always supposing that 
I loaned it as a special token of affection,—such,
at least, was the story she told him, and I
have never dared contradict her."  As Leah finished<pb n="40"/>
this incident, her dark eye seem to kindle with a
new light and a quiver ran through her frame. She
added, with strange emphasis:</p>
            <p>"One thing I would say, Lizzie, before passing
from this subject, and mark my words; my spirit is
not so broken nor my sense of justice so blunted but
that one day <emph>I shall have that miniature again</emph>. I
have sworn it, and as I live, I'll keep my vow. But I
must hasten on; it is already growing late. I come
now to the last and sorest trouble of my life.</p>
            <p>"For many years I have known Mark Abrams, the
son of our rabbi. We have been children and friends
together, almost from the time my mother died. He
was always so gentle and kind to me in his boyhood,
that I often wondered what the world would be without 
Mark Abrams in it. He was always the object of
my childish admiration, and, indeed, the only friend I
ever had who dared, or cared to show me any kindness. 
A year ago now; a little more than a year, he
whispered to me a tender tale of love, and my poor
heart thrilled with ecstasy at his words. Yes, he
asked me to become his wife, when my school days
should be ended, and I promised him that I would.</p>
            <p>"No one knew at that sweet time, of his love for
me. I did not dream of it myself, till he told me—surprised
me, with the unexpected revelation. I
begged that our happiness be kept a secret until my
school days were finished. This was my fatal mistake. 
You know our people have few secret engagements, and 
if I had only allowed Mark to speak to my
father at first, then all would have been well. But
the enemy has at last overtaken me, and I fear I am<pb n="41"/>
conquered and ruined forever. For some months I
have thought that my step-mother suspected my secret,
and have imagined that I could detect her intention
to break the attachment if she found her suspicion to
be correct. Her every action has betrayed this intention. 
I have at times vaguely hinted my trials and
sorrows to Mark, but of the extent of that woman's
evil designing, he has had no conception. I was
ashamed to acquaint him fully with her true character. 
Would that I had, dear Lizzie! would that I
had, long ago! My fears that Mark was being led
into the subtle web of that evil woman's weaving, and
would surely be taken from me, were confirmed by his
absence from Bertha Levy's tea-party. He promised
me to attend, and my step-mother offered some inducement 
that kept him away. To resist her will, one
must have the strength of a Hercules.</p>
            <p>"Lizzie! Lizzie! I cannot tell you more; the sequel 
of my fears is too dreadful to unfold! Even
yet, my poor heart struggles to disbelieve it." Leah
dropped her head for a moment, while a sigh escaped
her tremulous lips, and was silent.</p>
            <p>"Go on, dear Leah. Tell me all," said Lizzie.</p>
            <p>And Leah continued. "For a long time I have
been perplexed to know where my step-mother kept
the key to a small cabinet drawer that I believed contained 
my long-hidden miniature. By diligent search,
I found it the day after Bertha's party, and, feeling
unusually unhappy, I determined, if possible, to see 
my mother's face once more. It was Sunday, and
that night we were invited to some private theatricals
at Mr. Israel Bachman's, whose daughter had just <orig>re-</orig>
               <pb n="42"/>
turned from school. You may remember his house on
Vine street. I declined to attend. By remaining at
home, I thought I could accomplish my purpose of
discovering the hidden treasure.</p>
            <p>"The cabinet was placed in the large closet attached
to the sitting-room. To explore it, I must conceal myself in 
the closet. After the family departed, leaving
me sole occupant of the house, a friend called. When
her visit ended, I was interrupted again by the servant,
so that it was late before I could begin my secret work.
At last all was quiet, and my explorations began.
First one key, and then another, was applied to the
lock, but without success. I worked away hopefully,
knowing the right one would come in turn if I were
not interrupted. Drawer after drawer was opened
and when the right keys were at last found, not one
yielded up the coveted prize. I trembled with fear of
disappointment. Only one remained to be opened;
what if that were empty, too? Slowly and with trembling 
hand I applied the key to this last delicate lock.
Just then I heard a sound in the hall, and footsteps
approaching. What should I do? Without stopping
to reflect, I closed the closet-door. As I did so, the
sitting-room door was opened, and my step-mother
entered, accompanied by Mark Abrams.</p>
            <p>"'Be seated,' my mother said blandly; and in my
covert I wondered what could be coming. Mark
obeyed, and drawing his chair nearer the fire waited
till she had laid aside her wrappings and seated herself
in front of him. Then she said:</p>
            <p>"'It's too bad, Mark, that your love for Leah is so
misplaced; but, as I have told you before as mildly as<pb n="43"/>
possible, there are reasons why her father would never
consent—reasons that are unalterable. Aside from
poor Leah's unfortunate deformity, there—'</p>
            <p>"'Deformity!' ejaculated Mark, in utter surprise,
'I would like to know how she is deformed? She,
the most perfect model that was ever cast in mortal
mould.'</p>
            <p>"'Still, my friend, I feel that it is but just and
proper that I acquaint you with a painful fact; <emph>dear
Leah is deformed</emph>.'</p>
            <p>"'<emph>And how</emph>?' Mark uttered hoarsely.</p>
            <p>"'She suffers from a spinal affection, that will in
time render her a hideous deformity, and perhaps a
helpless, hopeless invalid.'</p>
            <p>"'Merciful Heavens!' uttered Mark, with shocked
and incredulous expression, as he sat gazing into the
fire. At length he said:</p>
            <p>"'God knows how sorry I am to hear that, for I
love her, love her fondly!'</p>
            <p>"Quickly discerning the effect of her story, my
step-mother with well-feigned feeling continued:</p>
            <p>"'After Leah's school-term is ended, her father
contemplates taking her to Europe for medical advice
and skill, and in case of improvement, which is scarcely
supposable or to be hoped for, he has long ago promised
her hand to the son of a wealthy cousin somewhere in
that country—Baron von something—I can't remember hard names.'</p>
            <p>"At length Mark looked up again and said:</p>
            <p>"'Mrs. Mordecai, do not distress me farther. How
can I credit your story? How can I believe that
Miss Leah is aught but what she seems—the <orig>embodi-</orig>
               <pb n="44"/>
ment of health and beauty? Alas! for my broken,
vanished hopes! Alas! for my golden dreams of the
future!'</p>
            <p>"'Oh! don't take things too much to heart, my boy.
Leah does not care for you very much anyway. It
will be but a small disappointment to her, if indeed she
ever thought seriously of marrying you; and I remember 
to have heard her say that she never intended to
marry—conscious of her affliction, I suppose.'</p>
            <p>"Mark winced under these words, and replied,
'She need not have deceived me.'</p>
            <p>"'Oh! girls will be girls, you know; and after you
get over this trouble, if you still like the name, remember, 
here is Leah's sister Sarah, as fine a girl as you'll
find anywhere, if she is my daughter.'</p>
            <p>"'I could love her for her sister's sake, if nothing
more,' said Mark with feeling; and then he bowed his 
head upon the marble mantel and looked steadily into
the fire without a word.</p>
            <p>"'Then if you desire,' continued my step-mother,
with a little assumed hesitation, 'after reflection, you
may speak to her father on the subject. Sarah will
make a fine wife.'</p>
            <p>"Think of me, Lizzie! Think of me, in that 
miniature dungeon, silently listening to the death 
sentence of my earthly happiness! Think of my
weakness, in mutely listening to the lie that was,
perhaps, to wreck my whole life! Think of me, 
and pity me!" Leah brushed away a tear, the first
that had fallen from her stony eyes since the beginning 
of her story; and then she continued:</p>
            <p>"If Mark heeded these last words of my <orig>step-</orig>
               <pb n="45"/>
mother, he gave no evidence of it, for he continued to
stare blindly at the glowing grate, apparently oblivious
of every surrounding object. At length he aroused,
and said:</p>
            <p>"'I must be going.  Mrs. Mordecai, I bid you
good night.'</p>
            <p>"'Stay longer, I pray,' rejoined my step-mother;
and he replied:</p>
            <p>"'Not to-night; it's late now, and I must be
alone. Alone!' he reiterated sorrowfully, and then
was gone in a moment.</p>
            <p>All this time, Lizzie, I had stood shivering in my
hiding-place, with my trembling hand almost benumbed by 
the cold granite knob, by which I held the
door. I scarcely dared to breathe, for fear my presence 
would be revealed. The ordeal was terrible, I
assure you! I thanked Heaven when I heard the
library door open and close again, this time upon the
receding figure of my step-mother, for then I was free
again—free to breathe, and to move, and to sigh, if I
chose, without betraying my hiding-place, or the cause
of my concealment. I need not, could not if I chose,
tell you of my feelings on that occasion. I remember
them but dimly, even now. But this much I do remember, 
and so it shall be. I resolved that Mark
Abrams should be free, rather than be undeceived by
any word of mine. My pride, the little that is left in
my soul, and my resentment, the shadow of it that yet
lingers about me, struggled for a time in a fierce contest, 
and as usual, I yielded up my rights, and succumbed again 
to a cruel fate. My heart has given up
its treasure, and he will never know aught of the bitter<pb n="46"/>
            |
sacrifice. I feel that I am ill-fated and despised, Lizzie; 
and feeling so, I do not desire to overshadow the
life of Mark Abrams. I love him too much, too dearly,
ever to becloud his future with my miserable life. I
would rather live on and suffer in silence, as I have
done for years, unloved and unloving to the end."</p>
            <p>Here the beautiful girl ceased her story. Both
friends for a time were silent. In Lizzie's soft blue
eyes the tears glistened, and she looked with surprise
into the cold, hard face of Leah, which had lost its
gentle expression, and seemed petrified by this recital
of her woes. Then she said:</p>
            <p>"Would I could help you, Leah, by sharing your
sorrow."</p>
            <p>"No mortal being can help me, Lizzie. I am
ill-starred and ill-fated, I fear."</p>
            <p>Filled with sympathy, and with a heavy heart, 
Lizzie bent her head, and laid it in Leah's lap; and
her silent prayer, though unheard by mortal ear, ascended 
to the throne of the Eternal Father, and was
answered in the far-off future.</p>
            <p>"It's late, and we must go," said Leah; "already 
the street lamps are being lighted, and I shall have to
render some good excuse for being out so late."</p>
            <p>"So we must; it is growing late," Lizzie replied.</p>
            <p>"Remember now, I trust you, Lizzie," said Leah.</p>
            <p>"Never fear; I shall never betray your confidence."</p>
            <p>Then the two girls left the window, walked
hastily through the hall and corridor, down the spiral
staircase, out into the street, and turned homeward.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <p>THE two friends walked side by side in silence the 
distance of a square, and then their paths divided.</p>
            <p>As Lizzie Heartwell turned the corner that separated 
her from her companion, she drew her shawl
more closely around her benumbed form and quickened the steps 
that were hurrying her onward to her
uncle's home. Her mind was filled with sad and
gloomy thoughts—thoughts of the life and character
of her beloved friend. The misty twilight seemed deepened 
by the tears that bedimmed her vision, as she
thought again and again of the life blighted by sorrow,
and the character warped by treachery and deceit.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" thought she, "had the forming hand of
love but moulded that young life, how perfect would
have been its symmetry! What a fountain of joy
might now be welling in that heart's desert waste,
where scarcely a rill of affection is flowing."</p>
            <p>Filled with these and like thoughts, Lizzie reached
the doorway of her uncle's house, and was soon admitted 
beneath its hospitable roof.</p>
            <p>Leah Mordecai, when separated from Lizzie, plodded 
straight forward toward her father's elegant
home. The street lamps shone brightly, but the departing 
daylight, that was spreading its gloom over
the world, was not half so dark and desolate as her<pb n="48"/>
poor heart. Yet Leah seldom wept—her tears did
not start, like watchful sentinels, at every approach
of pain or joy. Only when the shrivelled fountain
of her heart was deeply stirred, did this fair creature
weep. Calm, placid, and beautiful in the lamp-light, 
the features of her young face betrayed no emotion,
as she passed one and another, on beyond the din of
the garrulous multitude.</p>
            <p>At last she stood before her father's gate, and rang
the bell.</p>
            <p>"Is that you, Miss Leah?" said Mingo the porter,
as he opened the door of the lodge.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Mingo, I am late this evening. Has my
father come home?"</p>
            <p>"Has just passed in, miss."</p>
            <p>"I am thankful for that," she murmured to herself.
"Thank you, Mingo," she added aloud, as the faithful
attendant closed the door.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>Nervous from excitement and emotion, it was late
that same night before Lizzie Heartwell could quiet 
herself to slumber. Leah's melancholy story still
haunted her.</p>
            <p>At length she slept and dreamed—slept with the
tear-stains on her cheeks, and dreamed a strange, incongruous, 
haunting dream, reverberating with the
deadly war of artillery, and flashing with blazing musketry. 
The sea, too, the quiet harbor, that she always
loved to look upon, was agitated and dark with mad,
surging waves.</p>
            <p>The gray old fort also stood frowning in the distance, 
with strange dark smoke issuing from behind <pb n="49"/>
its worn battlements. And amid this confusion of
dreams and distorted phantasms of the brain, ever and
anon appeared the sweet, sad face of Leah Mordecai,
looking with imploring gaze into the face of her sleeping friend.</p>
            <p>But at length this disturbed and mysterious slumber
was ended by the morning sun throwing its beams
through the window pane and arousing the sleeper to
consciousness. Once awakened, Lizzie sprang from
her bed, and involuntarily drew aside the snowy curtain
that draped the east window. Then she looked toward
the blue sea that surrounded the fort, and exclaimed,
"How funny! Defiance is standing grim and dark
in its sea-girt place as usual, and all is quiet in the
harbor. How funny people have such strange dreams.
But I fear the vision of that smoking fortress and that
angry harbor will not fade soon from my memory;
perhaps I have a taint of superstition in my nature.
But I must hasten, or I'll be late for the morning worship. 
I believe I'll tell my uncle of my dream."</p>

            <p>THE month sped on. The end of Madam Truxton's
year was rapidly advancing. School-friendships
that had grown and matured within the seminary walls,
now deepened and intensified as the day for final separation 
approached. All were studying, with a zeal commendable and necessary, 
too, for the final ordeal through
which Madam Truxton's pupils must necessarily pass.</p>
            <p>Since that dark, gloomy day when Leah Mordecai
acquainted Lizzie Heartwell with some of the facts of 
her sad life, not a word further had been spoken on the 
subject. But they had seemed bound to each other by
an indissoluble bond of love. No word harsher than
a caress, and no look sterner than a smile, had Lizzie
ever cast upon Leah; and as the thirsty, withered flowers
drink up the dew of heaven, so this girl of misfortune 
received that tender, unalloyed love.</p>
            <p>The inexorable duties of the school were pressing,
forbidding long confidential talks and clandestine interviews. 
Each and all were impressed with the fact that 
they were approaching an important, and, to some, a
dreaded epoch in their lives.</p>
            <p>Leah had long since acquainted Lizzie with the
consummation of her fears, informing her of the engagement 
between Mark Abrams and her sister Sarah. 
With this information—this avowal of her broken heart <pb n="51"/>
and hopes—Leah had enshrouded the subject with
silence and laid it away, as we lay our treasures in the
tomb. Lizzie, always compassionate and discreet,
made no mention of it; and so the silence was unbroken as the days passed on.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>In the Citadel Square, far above Madam Truxton's
seminary, the drilling, drilling, drilling, was daily going
on in these sunny days. Drilling, drilling, drilling—for
the coming battle of life, or for the crimson strife of
war that might desolate a land. Which was it? Only
the veiled years could answer this inquiry. Meanwhile, the drilling still went on.</p>
            <p>High hopes filled manly bosoms, and ambitious
hearts throbbed wildly, as the approaching end of
the military year drew nigh.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>Emile Le Grande sat dozing in his private chamber
late one evening, at the close of a severe day's duty,
seated in a capacious arm-chair, with his head dropped
upon his breast. The young man was dozing over
the journal that he held in his unconscious grasp.
Had one stolen beside him and looked down, he
might have read the following entries, beginning many
months previous to this evening.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>"<hi>January</hi>.—I have seen the fair Leah but three
times since Bertha Levy's tea-party, yet I have passed
her house daily for that purpose ever since. Zounds! 
It's an ill fate, I swear! . . .</p>
            <p>"<hi>February</hi>.—How my heart beat to-day, as I was
walking arm-in-arm with George Marshall, and we<pb n="52"/>
suddenly confronted the beautiful Jewess as she was
turning into Prince street.</p>
            <p>"'What a magnificent face, Emile! What Hebrew 
maiden is that bowing to you?'</p>
            <p>"'Miss Mordecai,' I proudly replied, 'the Jewish 
banker's daughter, of whom you have heard me
speak before.'</p>
            <p>"'Yes, certainly. Well, she is beautiful. You
seem a little bewitched, boy,', he said. And I said—nothing.</p>
            <p>"<hi>March</hi>.—I am more and more perplexed. The
Jewess is at the bottom of it all. To-day I hinted to
Helen something of my fancy for Leah Mordecai.
She only laughed. I was irritated by her ridicule,
and I told her I intended to marry Leah if I could.
Her silly reply was, 'Well, suppose you can't?' 
School-girls are intolerably silly, at Helen's age! She
thinks now of nothing and nobody but Henry Packard, 
and he's the stupidest cadet in the institute—everybody 
knows that. I wish I had a sister that could
sympathize with me. Wh-e-e-w! I am altogether out 
of sorts. Maybe I'll be all right to-morrow.</p>
            <p>"<hi>April</hi>.—Prof. Brown said to-day that I was not
studying hard enough, and if I did not spur up I
should come out shabbily at the end of the term.</p>
            <p>"George Marshall, too, good fellow that he is, says
I think too much about the girl. Maybe I do; but I 
should like him to tell me how a fellow is to help it. 
That Jewess bewilders me! If old Mordecai was not
rich, I should love her for her dreamy eyes. I'll
swear, ever since she spoke to me so sweetly a week
ago, and gave me a clasp of her white, slender hand, I<pb n="53"/>
haven't cared whether I was prompt at parade, studies,
or anything else—so I could always be prompt at
meeting her. She looks doleful sometimes. She cannot be very 
happy. I wonder what my mother would
think if she could read this journal. But, old book,
you never tell any tales, do you?</p>
            <p>"<hi>May</hi>.—The days are growing warmer—beautiful
days, too. Everything is in bloom, and the old Queen
City looks charming.  The girls, too, Madam Truxton's and 
all others, swarm about the town like bees
in a rose-garden. I meet them at every turn.</p>
            <p>"My uniform is getting rather shabby; the buttons
and lace are quite tarnished. I must have a new suit
before long.</p>
            <p>"I am a lucky fellow of late—have seen Leah M.
many times. She came home with Helen twice, and
I have walked with her many times. I have told her
that I love her, but she does not seem inclined to trust
me. Only to-day I sent her a magnolia leaf, upon
which was written, 'Je vous aime, ma belle Juive.'
Helen said she smiled as she took it and said, 'Thank
him, if you please.' That was favorable, I think.
Yes I consider myself a lucky fellow.</p>
            <p>"<hi>June</hi> 1.—I am all out of sorts to-night. Things
have not gone smoothly at the Citadel to-day. I was
again reprimanded by that old bald-headed Brown.
He must forget that I am a man, and not a mere
boy. I don't care whether 'I pass,' or not, as the
boys say.</p>
            <p>"'Deficient in mathematics,' the professor said,
gravely; and I suppose I am. I never could endure
figures, and yet I must make my living by them.</p>
            <pb n="54"/>
            <p>"French I understand pretty well. I depend
upon that to help me through.</p>
            <p>"George Marshall will do all he can for me, I
know; there's no better cadet in the institute; old
Brown says that himself. I find that George was
right when he told me long ago that I had too many 
thoughts in my head about the girls. Deuce take the 
thoughts! but they are there. My very proper and
punctilious mother, too, has been scoring me lately. 
Somehow she found out my fancy. Whew! how
she did scold me! Said she would like to know 
if I had forgotten the blood that flowed in the Le
Grande veins! If I were lost to family pride and
honor so far as to mingle my blood with that of the 
old pawnbroker, Mordecai! How she looked! How
she stamped the floor with her dainty foot when I
hinted at the fact that my maternal grandfather was
neither duke nor lord! How she hushed my 'impertinence,' 
as she styled it, with such invectives as 'fool,
idiot, plebeian'! Heigho!  But I felt that it was unmanly 
in me to provoke mother so, and I begged her
pardon.</p>
            <p>"I did not promise her, though, to leave off loving
Leah Mordecai. I did not tell her, either, that I had
asked Leah to be my wife one of these days, when
school-days were ended.</p>
            <p>"<hi>June</hi> 5.—The closing exercises of the schools
have been hurried up this year, as the weather is
exceedingly warm, and the Board of Health fear a
return of the terrible scourge, yellow fever, that so
devastated this fair city five years ago. Next week, 
Madam Truxton's seminary closes, and that is one<pb n="55"/>
week before the institute does. Invitations to Madam's
levee are already out. The graduating class of cadets
are invited—lucky fellows!</p>
            <p>"Helen seems really sad at the prospect of parting
with her school-days and her friends. But then she
is eighteen, and that's quite old enough for a girl
to come out. She says, too, that of all the girls at
school, Lizzie Heartwell will be the most regretted
when she leaves the Queen City for her home in a distant State. 
She is quite a pretty girl, but too religious,
I should judge, from what Helen says. Her mother is
a widow. I guess they are poor.</p>
            <p>"Mother is quite reconciled to me again, and spoke
playfully to me last night about marrying Miss Belle
Upton, who is to visit Helen next week and attend
the closing of Madam Truxton's school. Well, 'we
shall see what we shall see,' but I hardly think I will.
She can hardly eclipse 'Leah Mordecai the beautiful,'—that's
the way I write it now."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
            <p>THE examination-days at Madam Truxton's were
over. The long-dreaded reviews had been passed
with credit to both pupils and instructors. The certificates 
of scholarship, and the "rewards of merit," had 
been given to the fortunate competitors; the long-coveted diplomas 
awarded to the expectant "finishing class," and that memorable term 
of school life was closed forever. The hour for the event had come. 
The grand old drawing-rooms above the assembly hall
in the spacious building were filled to repletion— 
filled with the patrons and select guests that were
honored with the fastidious Madam's courtesy. It 
was an elegant assembly, one characteristic of the
Queen City in her days of unostentatious aristocracy,
of gentle-bred men and women.</p>
            <p>Conspicuous among the famed guests were the 
three-score cadets, themselves just ready to emerge
from college walls and step forth with triumphant 
tread upon life's broad opening field.</p>
            <p>The "finishing class" numbered more than a score
of girls—all young, some gifted, many beautiful—whose
homes were scattered far and wide through the
country; young girls who, for many months, and even
years, had lived and studied and loved together, with
all the ardor and strength of youth. Now they were<pb n="57"/>
to be sundered; sundered with no prospect of future
reunion.</p>
            <p>All felt this approaching separation with more or
less sorrow, according to their varying natures; and
some contemplated it with deep regret.</p>
            <p>The greetings, congratulations, and presentations
were over, and Madam Truxton, in all her stately elegance, 
had at last relaxed her rigid vigilance, and the
"finishing class" were free—free to wander for the
first time, and that first the last too, among the spacious 
halls and corridors of the old school building, as
young ladies. Free to receive the smiles and addresses
of the long-forbidden cadets without fear of madam's
portentous frown.</p>
            <p>At length the sound of music rose upon the air.
Knotted groups here and there bespoke the preparation for 
the dance. Sets were forming in drawing-rooms and halls, and 
impatient feet were moving to the measure of the prelude.</p>
            <p>"Miss Heartwell, may I claim your hand for the
quadrille?" said George Marshall, bowing before
Lizzie at the presentation of Madam Truxton herself.</p>
            <p>"I thank you, I never dance, Mr. Marshall."</p>
            <p>"Not dance! How's that?"</p>
            <p>"Never learned, sir."</p>
            <p>"That's stranger still. I supposed all of madam's
young ladies danced."</p>
            <p>"In general they do," replied Lizzie, "but from
peculiar circumstances I am an exception to the general 
rule. If you desire a partner in the dance, allow
ne to present you to my friend, Bertha Levy. She
dances like a fay."</p>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p>"Not just now, thank you, Miss Heartwell; if it
is not impertinent, I would like to know why you do
not dance."</p>
            <p>"Well, it's a simple story, quickly told; and if you
will listen a moment I'll inform you, if you desire."</p>
            <p>"With pleasure. Go on."</p>
            <p>"Melrose, my native home, in the State of ——, is 
a quiet little town, with little social life and less gayety.
My mother, too, is a widow, who has lived in great
seclusion ever since my father's death, which occurred 
when I was a little child. I have been her only companion 
in all these years of bereavement and sorrow, 
and it has never been her desire that I should indulge
in any of the pleasures and gayeties that young people
are fond of. From these causes my life has assumed a
sombre tone that may seem, and indeed is, unnatural
in the young. Yet, as I have known nothing else all
my life, it is no trial for me to forego the pleasures
that are so alluring to you, perhaps, Mr. Marshall."</p>
            <p>George Marshall made no reply, and for a time
seemed absorbed in contemplation. He had listened 
attentively to this simple, half-told history of her life. 
And as he marked the gentle expression of her spirituelle 
face, she became in his eyes a model of beauty. 
The allusion to the death of her father had recalled 
to his mind the time and manner of his own father's
death—a time when the terrible plague of yellow fever 
had swept over the Queen City with devastating wing. 
Observing George Marshall's silent, absorbed manner,
Lizzie continued:</p>
            <p>"You think me very uninteresting, I dare say.
Young ladies who do not dance are generally so <orig>con-</orig>
               <pb n="59"/>
sidered. Allow me to present you to some of my
friends who will—"</p>
            <p>"I beg pardon, Miss Heartwell, for my inattention.
I was thinking of the past—the past recalled by your
own story. Excuse my abstraction, I pray."</p>
            <p>"But the young ladies?" said Lizzie.</p>
            <p>"I do not care to dance now, if you will allow me
the pleasure of a promenade," he replied.</p>
            <p>"Certainly I will," replied Lizzie with a graceful
bend of the shapely head; and clasping with her timid
little hand the strong arm of the manly cadet, she
passed with him from the lower drawing-room across
the hall to the library.</p>
            <p>"There's more room in the corridor than here,"
said Lizzie; "suppose we go there?"</p>
            <p>"First let me ask a question, suggested by the
musical instrument I see standing in the library. Do
you sing? Do you sing with the harp?"</p>
            <p>"I do."</p>
            <p>"Will you not sing for me?"</p>
            <p>"I will, with pleasure, if you will make room in the
library," she replied with unaffected simplicity. The
library was occupied by a number of matronly ladies
and elderly gentlemen—all of the guests who were
not participating in the dance. Lizzie bowed her head
slightly, and passed to the harp, now silent in one corner. 
Without hesitation she seated herself before it,
and the slender fingers grasped the strings of the instrument 
with a masterly touch, running through a soft,
sweet prelude of tender chords. Her voice at last trilled
forth in the charming strains of the old Scotch ballad,
<quote>
                  <l part="N">"Down the burn, Davy, love."</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <pb n="60"/>
            <p>Concluding this old favorite air, she sang again,
with sweetness, the witching song,
<quote>
                  <l part="N">"I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows."</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Then rising from the harp, she said, with sweet
accent and sweeter smile, "Now that I have bewitched
you with my music, Mr. Marshall, I am ready for the
promenade on the corridor."</p>
            <p>These words so lightly spoken by the girl, were 
but the utterance of a truth of which she had no suspicion. 
George Marshall was indeed bewitched, and 
bowing a silent assent, he offered his arm to the enchantress, 
and soon Lizzie found herself among the 
dancers, who were seeking temporary relaxation from
the exercise, scattered in groups here, there, and everywhere 
about the spacious building.</p>
            <p>Out into the long balcony, where the silvery moonlight 
lay softly as dew upon the flowers, George Marshall led 
the way, with the young girl clinging timidly
to the brave strong arm, that for months had known
no tenderer touch than the cold, cruel steel of the musket, 
the constant companion of the cadet in the military
course just closing.</p>
            <p>They passed in silence through the corridor, and at
last stood at the eastern end that overlooked the sea,
stretching her arms around the child of her bosom, the
devoted Queen City.</p>
            <p>George Marshall, always taciturn, was now painfully 
silent. His brain, always quick and clear to 
comprehend a problem in Legendre, now seemed beclouded 
and sluggish. At length, embarrassed by the<pb n="61"/>
oppressive silence, Lizzie endeavored to arouse her
companion by remarking,</p>
            <p>"Are you fond of the sea, Mr. Marshall?"</p>
            <p>Still gazing eastward over the deep, he replied
abstractedly:</p>
            <p>"Do you mean, am I fond of sea-life? If so, I
answer most emphatically, No. There's but one life
in this world that attracts me"—and here his manner
grew constrained as he continued—"but one, and that's
the life of a soldier. I love military life and service,
and when my course is finished—which time is near
at hand—if I am successful, as I hope to be, I shall 
offer myself to my country, and await impatiently her
refusal or acceptance of my humble services. But I
beg your pardon, if my enthusiasm has led me away
from your inquiry. I only like <emph>to look</emph> upon the sea;
its grandeur in a storm, and the peaceful repose that
follows, excite my admiration, but that's all. It's
something too treacherous to love."</p>
            <p>"You fear the water, then," asked Lizzie smiling.</p>
            <p>"Look to-night, if you please," was the answer, "at
the soft silver sheen that covers its beautiful blue
bosom, and imagine, if you can, such peaceful water
engulfing a hapless bark within its silent depths!
Oh no; I only admire the sea as a part of God's wonderful 
creation. But, Miss Heartwell, there's something just 
visible in the hazy distance that I do love;
it's old Defiance. You see the lights of the old fort
twinkling far off on the water? They stir within
me the martial spirit, and seem to beckon me on to
an unknown, but longed-for destiny. It may be fancy,
yet there has been a peculiar feeling toward that old<pb n="62"/>
fort ever since I first became a cadet at the Citadel.
Why do you frown?  Do you object to my enthusiasm?"</p>
            <p>"By no means," replied Lizzie quickly; "but,
strangely as it seems to fascinate you, it has always
repelled, and even terrified me. It's the only object
of the beautiful harbor that has ever cast a shadow
across the loveliness of the sea. I hate it; and I have
often wished the sea would draw it silently into its
hungry depths, and leave no trace of it behind."</p>
            <p>George laughed.</p>
            <p>"Your fancy amuses me," he said. "It would
never do to obliterate old Defiance, for then the enemy, 
should they ever come, would find easy access to
the Queen City, and ruin and destruction might follow."</p>
            <p>"Well, I guess my wishes will be unavailing in
the future, as they have been in the past; and as I
leave the Queen City to-morrow, old Defiance will fade
from my sight though not from my memory, for a long,
long time. So for the present I wish it no ill."</p>
            <p>"Indeed," replied George Marshall in surprise,
"do you leave the Queen City to-morrow—so soon?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, I go by steamer—by the Firefly, that leaves
to-morrow for the port of ——, in my native State,
and from there to Melrose, where I live."</p>
            <p>"At what hour does the steamer leave?" inquired
the young man thoughtfully.</p>
            <p>"At six P.M., uncle tells me."</p>
            <p>"And you leave so soon—six P.M. to-morrow?" he
asked. "Maybe I am selfish in monopolizing you so
long, Miss Heartwell. I have two friends you must
know before the evening closes—Edwin Calhoun and<pb n="63"/>
Emile Le Grande. Have you met them? The dancing has 
ceased again, and we'll look them up."</p>
            <p>"Thank you."</p>
            <p>"Before we leave this moonlit spot, however, Miss
Heartwell, I beg that you make friends with old Defiance, 
for my sake, and recall that cruel wish concerning him," 
he said playfully, and with an arch smile.</p>
            <p>Lizzie replied, "For your sake, I will, and for yours
only;" and throwing a kiss across the silvery sea,
she said, "Take that, old fort, as a peace-offering."</p>
            <p>The winds sighed and the sea murmured as they
turned to rejoin the revellers, and that sportive kiss
was borne away on the wandering breeze.</p>
            <p>The revelry must end. Madam's love-bound pupils
must be separated. The adieus must be spoken, but
there must be no tears; that were a weak and indecorous 
manifestation of feeling, in madam's estimation.
Blandly bowing her stately head, and kindly congratulating 
each upon having "finished," and finished
well, madam gracefully waved them out of her presence, 
into the future, with a gentle motion of her jewelled hand.</p>
            <p>"I shall see you to morrow, Lizzie," whispered Leah
Mordecai, as she passed from the seminary escorted by
Emile Le Grande.</p>
            <p>"Certainly, at any hour, and do not disappoint me.
Remember it's the last day."</p>
            <p>All were gone. The stars twinkled faintly in the
sky. Every light in madam's great house was extinguished, 
and all sound of that evening's revel hushed
forever.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <p>THE morning sun threw its ruddy beams, warm
almost to tropical heat, through the half-closed
casement of Leah Mordecai's apartment, and the intrusive 
light opened the dark, dreamy eyes to consciousness. 
The hour was late. Toil-worn and languid
from hard study and the relaxing climate, Leah rested
in her bed reluctant to arise.</p>
            <p>"It's all over now; school-days are ended, and I am
acknowledged a young lady, I suppose," thought Leah
half-consciously, as she aroused at length from slumber.
Then the thought came that it was the last day of
Lizzie Heartwell's sojourn in the Queen City; and
Leah sprang from her repose with a new and powerful
impulse. "I shall spend these last hours with her,"
she muttered articulately, as she hastily performed the
morning's simple toilet. "Yes, I'll tell her my secret,
too, though to no living soul have I breathed it yet,"
she continued audibly, as she adjusted a pin here and
there among the dark braids of her hair. At last,
smoothing the jetty bands across the fair, oval forehead,
she glanced back again to see that the scar—the hated,
dreadful scar—was hidden. Then placing a knot of
scarlet ribbon amid the delicate lace-work of her snowy
morning dress, she languidly descended the stairs and<pb n="65"/>
entered the library, where her father sat awaiting her
appearance.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mordecai was proud of Leah; proud of her
attainments at school, gratified with her grade of deportment, 
and delighted that she had "finished," and
with so much credit. As she entered the library,
he arose, and clasping her in his arms, imprinted first
a good-morning and then a congratulatory kiss upon
her face.</p>
            <p>"I am proud of my daughter," he said; "proud
that no one at Madam Truxton's excelled my own
Leah. I am proud of your example to your sisters, and
trust they will strive to emulate it."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, father. I hope I shall never cause you
shame," she replied with tenderness.</p>
            <p>During this brief dialogue, the evil-eyed mother
had sat an attentive listener, her jealous nature stirred
to its depths. Then she said:</p>
            <p>"If you are so proud of Leah now, what will you
feel when Sarah is through school?"</p>
            <p>"Additional happiness, I trust; and following her
sister's example, she cannot disappoint papa," said Mr.
Mordecai, stroking Sarah upon the head softly, as he
arose and led the way to the breakfast table.</p>
            <p>The morning repast was finished with more than
becoming haste, for Mr. Mordecai had waited to welcome his 
daughter, and would consequently be late at
his bank.</p>
            <p>"It's real late," said Leah, as she followed her
father from the house. "I hear the Citadel clock
striking ten. I must spend the morning with Lizzie."
Then donning the light Leghorn hat that gave her a<pb n="66"/>
gypsy-like appearance, she started forth toward Rev.
Dr. Heartwell's unpretentious house. As she passed
block and square that marked the distance, her heart
was heavy and her thoughts were sorrowful. She realized 
that it was perhaps her final leave-taking of her
most cherished friend. Her path led past the walls
of the dark, gray citadel, and as she cast a glance
up toward its turreted heights, and its prison-like
windows, she sighed a deep-drawn, heart-felt sigh.
And why?</p>
            <p>The gentle sea-breeze had arisen, and though it
sported with the helpless ribbon upon her bosom, and
kissed again and again the crimson cheeks, it could
not cool the fires of anxiety and sorrow that burned
within her heart. She felt that she was losing much
in losing Lizzie Heartwell. And the fear was not an
idle one.</p>
            <p>Trembling with fatigue and deep-hidden emotion, 
Leah at length stood at the door of Dr. Heartwell's 
house, awaiting the answer of the porter.</p>
            <p>The door opened. "M-m-miss L-l-lizzie s-s-says
c-c-come right u-up stairs, M-m-iss M-m-ordecai,"
stuttered out the polished black Hannibal who attended
the door, known throughout the large circle of Dr.
Heartwell's friends and acquaintances as a most accomplished 
servant and a most miserable stammerer.</p>
            <p>"Very well; please show me the way," replied
Leah, repressing a smile.</p>
            <p>Up two flights of stairs she followed the dark guide,
and when they arrived at Lizzie's room, whose door
stood ajar, he said, with a flourish of his right hand;
"M-m-iss M-m-mordecai, M-m-iss L-l-lizzie."</p>
            <pb n="67"/>
            <p>"Well, Hannibal, why don't you tell me?" said
Lizzie playfully; and Hannibal retreated below stairs,
grinning and rubbing his head in confusion. The
girls were left alone. Lizzie was busy packing trunks
and arranging boxes, while every description of feminine 
paraphernalia was lying about the room in disorder.</p>
            <p>"Now let me help you, dear," said Leah, "and
then we can have a long talk."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, so we will. I'll first tumble these
things into that trunk quick as a flash, for Aunt Rose
will not come up to inspect them, I guess; and when I
get home my mother will give them a good overhauling. 
I am tired and worn out from hard study and
excitement, and my good mother will excuse my disorder, this time. 
Cram them in. Here goes the shawl, now comes my dress, 
the muslin I wore last night.
Don't let me crush that. I'll fold it carefully, for the
sake of the compliment it secured me last night," said
Lizzie, smiling as she turned the snowy garment about,
folding it for the trunk.</p>
            <p>"What was that?" said Leah.</p>
            <p>"George Marshall said I looked like a pearl, my
dress was so gauzy. How does that sound to-day? It
sounded very well last night. I scarcely made him a
reply. I don't know how to reply to such speeches,
but I thought if I did look like a pearl in my gauzy
robes, it was owing to my mother's good taste and
skilful fingers, for no professional modiste touched or
contrived my dress."</p>
            <p>"It's as handsome as any Madame Aufait turns
out, I think," said Leah.</p>
            <pb n="68"/>
            <p>"Not as handsome as yours, Leah; but then my
mother has to consider the cost in everything, and
you do not."</p>
            <p>These words of Lizzie's, this kind and loving allusion 
to her mother's tenderness and never-wearying
care, fell upon the heart of Leah as the cold, cruel steel
falls upon the unoffending dove. She looked out of
the window and brushed a tear from the fringed eyelids, 
that Lizzie might not see it.</p>
            <p>Lizzie continued, "I must take care of this dress,
Leah; I don't know when I shall have a new one
again. Maybe, dear, the next time you hear from me,
I'll be playing school-ma'am, and such robes will not
be often brought into use. How would you like to
be my pupil, Leah?" she said, with a forced attempt
at pleasantry.</p>
            <p>Leah looked seriously at her friend a moment,
and said, "You haven't any idea of teaching, really,
Lizzie?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, dear, I may teach. My mother is a widow,
you know, and by no means wealthy. I am the oldest
child. She has educated me at great sacrifice, with
my dear uncle's assistance, and it would be wrong in
me not to show my gratitude by at least endeavoring
to maintain myself, if nothing more. Oh yes, love,
by and by I shall be an angular school-ma'am, unless"—and
she laughed a roguish, merry laugh—"unless I
get married."</p>
            <p>"Dear me! how the wind blows!" said Leah, as
the white muslin curtain flapped backward and forward
in the playful breeze, ever and anon covering her beautiful head and face.</p>
            <pb n="69"/>
            <p>"Yes, Leah, this same sweet sea-breeze will soon
waft me far from you, when to meet again, God only
knows. I am about through this packing now, and
we must have our talk—our last, long, confidential
chat, for many, many days."—"Maybe years," Leah
added sorrowfully.</p>
            <p>"Here goes old trunk number one. Books, and
everything pertaining to school-days, are tucked away
in you;" and she turned the key. "This one, number
two, I shall not close till Aunt Rose makes a little
deposit in it of something for my mother—so she
requested me." Then stooping down, Lizzie drew
forth from its hiding-place a carefully wrapped little
bundle, and handing it to Leah, said:</p>
            <p>"Here, dear, is a scarlet silk scarf, fringed with
gold, that I desire to give you as a keepsake. It is
something I prize, as it was brought from Greece by
an uncle of mine, some years ago. Its colors will contrast 
beautifully with your sweet face; take it."</p>
            <p>"Keep it yourself, Lizzie. I need nothing, I care
for nothing, for personal adornment. You tell me I
am beautiful, but that does not satisfy the heart that
has suffered so from cruel wrong-doing. I care only
for that of which I receive so little—human sympathy
and love. Take it back."</p>
            <p>"No; keep it as a memento of my love, if you
never care to wear it," said Lizzie.</p>
            <p>Leah laid her arms around Lizzie's neck at these
words, and bending her head kissed her again and
again.</p>
            <p>"Now I am done, let's sit here by the window
that looks out toward the sea, and have our chat."</p>

            <p>"TO-DAY you leave me, Lizzie," Leah began;
"leave poor Leah with no one—" then she
stopped.</p>
            <p>"Why do you hesitate? Is there something that
troubles you?" Lizzie asked, observing Leah's hesitation.</p>
            <p>"Yes," Leah said faintly, "there is something that
troubles me—something that I fear to tell even you,
dear Lizzie."</p>
            <p>"Can't you trust me?"</p>
            <p>"Not that, Lizzie; but I am ashamed to tell you,
and afraid too. But," she continued, "you know
what I suffered about Mark Abrams, and how his love
was taken from me and secured for another. Well"—she
hesitated again. "The secret I am about to disclose 
now, does not concern Mark Abrams, or any
other Hebrew under the sun."</p>
            <p>"Is it some love-affair with a Gentile?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," whispered Leah, "and it greatly perplexes
me. It is something that has been forced upon me, and
tremblingly I come to you for advice."</p>
            <p>"Whom does it concern?"</p>
            <p>"One that tells me he loves me, and swears eternal
devotion—one whose name I hardly dare to mention."</p>
            <p>"I hope he is worthy of you, whoever it may be."</p>
            <pb n="71"/>
            <p>"Have you not suspected me, Lizzie? Has not
my tell-tale face betrayed me before? Can't you think
who it is to whom I refer?"</p>
            <p>"Can it be Emile Le Grande?" said Lizzie, after a
moment's reflection, with a look of astonishment.</p>
            <p>"Yes," faltered Leah, "he is the one that tells me
he loves me."</p>
            <p>"And do you love him, Leah?" said Lizzie, with
some hesitation. The curtain that continued fluttering 
with renewed force was wafted full into the face
of the young Jewess, and veiled the crimson blushes
that overspread it. As gently as it came, the curtain
floated back, and Lizzie detected the traces of Leah's
sudden emotion. Without waiting for further inquiry,
Leah continued:</p>
            <p>"I determined I would tell you all, Lizzie, before
we parted, and ask your advice. Yes, I think I do
love Emile—love him, because he says he loves me.
Last night he urged me again to become his wife. I
trembled like a frightened bird; I felt that I was
listening to dangerous words, yet I had not courage
to break away from him."</p>
            <p>"Did he say anything else—I mean about your
being a Jewess?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes; much. He said he cared nothing about
that difference, if I did not; but I told him I did. I
assured him that I had been reared a Hebrew of the
straightest sect, and that my father would never
consent to my marrying a Christian. At my remarks
he laughed, and replied that he would take care of the
opposition, if I would only marry him. He urged
and pleaded with me to promise him, but I steadfastly<pb n="72"/>
refused. He is very fascinating though, and I think
a dangerous man to come in the way of a poor, irresolute, 
unhappy girl like myself."</p>
            <p>"Did he say much about the difference in religion,
Leah?"</p>
            <p>"He said something, not a great deal; said he was
not religious himself; that one faith was about as
useful to him as another, as he did not know positively
which was the true one. He said he would as soon
marry a Jewess as a Christian, so he loved her, and
the religion might take care of itself."</p>
            <p>"Did you ask if his parents knew of his love
for you?"</p>
            <p>"Yes. He replied that Helen knew of it, but he
had not troubled himself to tell his parents. I did
not like that remark; and I replied that they would
doubtless object to my being a Jewess, should he tell
them. He laughed at the bare suggestion, and I
upbraided him a little for this apparent disregard of
his parents."</p>
            <p>"You might have referred him to the fifth commandment 
with propriety, Leah, I think."</p>
            <p>"So I might, but did not think of it. I have told
you about all now, Lizzie, and I want your opinion
of such intermarrying. The subject stirs me deeply,
and I have no other friend to whom I would dare confide it. 
I trust no one as I do you." Leah looked
seriously and steadily into her friend's face, and Lizzie began:</p>
            <p>"What I say now, Leah, is not intended as advice
to you in regard to marrying Emile Le Grande, but
only my opinion in general about marriages where<pb n="73"/>
such material differences exist. In the first place, a
man who confesses that he has no religious faith, is
to be pitied, if not despised. And I think an unbelieving 
Christian far worse than the most unbelieving
Jew. It argues such an utter want of consistency and
fidelity. I should fear to trust a man that could make
such a confession. The Le Grandes are an irreligious
family, and Emile's education has necessarily been
neglected in that most important respect. In consequence 
of their want of religious principles, they are
notoriously proud, haughty, and vain—silly even—of
their family distinction. I imagine that Mrs. Le
Grande could scarcely receive a deeper wound to her
family pride, than from Emile's marrying a Jewess,
no matter how lovely or high-born. All she knows
or remembers of the Mordecais is, that the banker was
once a poor, despised pawnbroker. No years of honest
endeavor, or successful attainment, could wipe this fact
from her retentive memory. It would be a misnomer,
Leah, to call such a woman a Christian. She is an utter
stranger to the sweet principles of faith and love embraced 
by true Christians, and practised by those who
believe that they have 'passed from death unto life.'</p>
            <p>"Then, your people, too, are unrelenting in their
views on such unnatural marriages. Suppose you
were to marry this man, in the face of the unyielding
opposition of the parents on both sides—there's little
hope that they could be reconciled. You see at once
how you might be considered an outcast from your
people and his too. Your children would be neither
Jew nor Christian; for all the external rites and ceremonies 
of the earth cannot transform a Christian into<pb n="74"/>
a Jew, or a Jew into a Christian. Accursed be the
nominal Christian that would allow his children, by
ceremony or rite, to be made nominally Jews. Such
a one is worse than an infidel; and has denied the
faith. God made the Hebrews a great and glorious
people—his own chosen children. But between
Christians and Hebrew there is a wide, wide difference; and God made that, too.</p>
            <p>"No; Leah, if I were advising a Jewess to marry a
Gentile, which I am not doing, I would say, Select a
man deeply rooted in religious principle, and clinging
humbly to his Christian faith. Such a man would
rarely, if ever, deceive or ill-use you."</p>
            <p>"I see that you are right, Lizzie," interrupted
Leah, apparently aroused by her companion's words.
"I'll heed your teaching, and never listen to another
word of love from the one who might lead me into
temptation, and perhaps into a fatal snare. Alas!"
she continued, with her dark eyes flashing, "but for
a terrible lie, a cruel deception, I should still be the
affianced of Mark Abrams, and happy in the hope
of becoming his wife—not an unhappy, disappointed
girl, open to the flattery and fascinations of another
man."</p>
            <p>"Keep your resolve, Leah, if you can; and may the
all-wise Father give you strength," replied Lizzie.</p>
            <p>"God helping me, I will; but you know I am a
weak and helpless creature, and when you are gone,
my only bosom-comfort and faithful friend will have
departed. Promise me that you will never cease to
love me, and remember with pity the heart that loves
you and will ever yearn to be with you."</p>
            <pb n="75"/>
            <p>Lizzie made no reply; the swelling heart choked
down the utterances that struggled to escape her
lips; and drawing Leah close to her bosom, she
embraced her in a silent, warm, and tender clasp.
"Trust me, even unto death," at length she whispered softly; and the reply came:</p>
            <p>"I will."</p>
            <p>At the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs,
Lizzie said, "There comes Aunt Rose. You will be
at the wharf this evening, Leah, to see me off, and to
bid me God-speed with one of your bright smiles, that
I may hope for a safe arrival at my destined port?"</p>
            <p>"Well, we have had our talk without interruption,
and so I'll leave you," said Leah. "Your aunt will
certainly want you to herself awhile. I'll meet you
at the wharf in time. Till then, good-by."</p>
            <p>As Mrs. Heartwell entered Lizzie's room, Leah
passed out; and a sweeter, sadder face Mrs. Heartwell said she had rarely seen.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
            <p>THE hours stole on, and the one for Lizzie's departure 
was at hand. As the sun sank slowly down
to rest, on that memorable sunny June day, clouds of
crimson, purple, and gold, blended in fantastic shapes,
overspread the broad horizon, and attracted the most
casual observer by their wondrous beauty. Toward
the eastern horizon the sky was blue and cloudless,
blending with the water in a vast azure immensity.</p>
            <p>The cool, crisp sea-breeze had dissipated the intense 
heat of the day, and crowds of gay pedestrians,
and scores of liveried vehicles, were passing and repassing 
upon the fashionable boulevard, where the wealth
and beauty of the Queen City daily gathered after the
heat of the day was over.</p>
            <p>The Firefly, laden with her burden, was ready at
the pier, awaiting the signal to depart. Lizzie Heartwell's 
friends still lingered upon the inviting deck, reluctant 
to speak the parting word that must so surely
come. Dr. and Mrs. Heartwell, her uncle and aunt,
Judge Amity and his daughter, her Sabbath-school
teacher, Bertha, Helen, and Leah, the remaining ones
of the "indissoluble quartette," as the school-girls
termed these friends, were assembled on the deck, and
with them Emile Le Grande and her newly formed
friend, George Marshall. In compliance with his <orig>prom-</orig>
               <pb n="77"/>
ise he had come to speed the parting vessel with
good wishes, and watch its receding form till it was
lost from view upon the trackless waters.</p>
            <p>As the citadel gun fired its sunset signal, the
planks were ordered in, friends rushed on shore, and
then the Firefly moved from her moorings, to plough
the deep again. As George Marshall spoke his last
adieu, he slipped a tiny billet-doux into the hand of
the departing girl, who half heeding the action, dropped
it into her pocket, and sat down in loneliness upon the
deck, to watch the slowly vanishing shore. Fainter
and dimmer grew the speck upon the deep to the friends
who watched on shore, fainter and dimmer in the gathering 
twilight, till the bark rounded old Defiance, and
was divided by distance and darkness from their vision.</p>
            <p>When Lizzie Heartwell, attended by the kind captain, 
descended below deck, she remembered the little
missive, and drawing it from its hiding-place, read:</p>
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <div type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>"Miss HEARTWELL: What would you think, if my
wanderings should lead me, some day, to Melrose?</p>

                           <salute>"Regretfully,</salute>

            <p>"Think I should like to see you," uttered the
young girl, with a smile, as she folded the note again
out of sight.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>As the last glimpse of the Firefly faded from the
vision of the sad-eyed watchers, they turned slowly from
their lookout of sorrow, and bent their steps homeward.</p>
            <p>"It's growing late, Miss Leah," said Emile, who<pb n="78"/>
stood near the young Jewess. "May I see you safely
home?"</p>
            <p>"Thank you, but it is not too late for me to go
alone," she replied; "besides, my walk will lead to my
uncle Jacob's, where I may spend the night; that's not
very far, you know."</p>
            <p>Determined not to be baffled in his purpose to
escort Leah, he replied:</p>
            <p>"'The longer the walk, the shorter the way,' with
you, Miss Leah. Allow me to attend you, I pray."
His pertinacity prevailed; and falteringly she replied,
"As you like, Mr. Le Grande," resolving in her heart
though, that this should be the last time. "Only this
morning," thought she, "what did I promise Lizzie?
And before the day is ended, I have broken that promise. 
What an irresolute creature I am! <emph>But this shall
be the last. I vow it again</emph>."</p>
            <p>"You will miss Miss Heartwell, I judge," began
Emile, as he walked forward by her side. "From
your sorrowful expression, one might think she had died,
instead of vanished from sight in a vessel. I trust there
are yet some friends in the Queen City; at least one,
who will be kindly remembered in the absence of Miss
Heartwell."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Mr. Le Grande, I have some friends, a few,
I trust, left behind; but no one, not a soul, that can
supply her place in my affections. She has been more
than a school-friend to me; she has been a counsellor, a
sister; one who above all others comprehends my nature
and sympathizes with and appreciates my character,"
said Leah, warmly.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, Miss Heartwell is to be envied in <orig>pos-</orig>
               <pb n="79"/>
sessing so much of your affection, and yet I think you
speak unjustly in attributing to her alone the heart of
love and sympathy you do. Have I not told you of
my attachment and devotion to you? And do you
still require other protestations to confirm the sincerity
of my confession?"</p>
            <p>At these words—unwelcome words to Leah—she
colored deeply, and turning her dark, burning eyes full
upon Emile, said:</p>
            <p>"Mr. Le Grande, I pray you never let me hear
you utter such a sentiment as that again. We are
friends, and, if you choose, may always be; but, in all
truthfulness I say it, more than friends we can never
be. I confess frankly that your society is very agreeable 
to me, your manner fascinating, your style attractive; but 
I am a Jewess of the strictest sect, and you
a Christian, and not a strict one; and these facts alone
form an insurmountable barrier in the way of our being 
more than friends. A great gulf lies between us,
over which even love cannot securely go. You cannot come to me, 
and I dare not cross to you. It is dishonor to God and 
disobedience to parents, to think of
such a step. Mr. Le Grande, I beg you, forget this
passion you profess; crush it out if it exists, and remember 
Leah Mordecai, the Jewess, as only a friend.
Do you promise?" she said, trembling from head to
to foot, for it had required all the moral strength of
her yielding nature to utter these words—words that
could instantly quench the only taper of hope that still
burned in her soul.</p>
            <p>"Do I promise?" he replied with haughty emotion. "No! I 
swear I will not! So long as you are<pb n="80"/>
free I will love you; and so long as your maidenhood
gives the opportunity, I shall tell you of that love.
Give you up? I, who love you with a mad and foolish
devotion? I promise not to love you? No! no!
Never, never, never, while hope lasts. What care I
if you are a Jewess? It's the shrine of beauty where
I bow, and because a Jewess breathes therein, shall
I withdraw my homage? Never while I live. I
swear it!"</p>
            <p>Frightened at her desperate lover's words, Leah
walked on in silence, almost regretting that her courage had 
permitted her to speak her mind so freely.
After a time she said, "Do not be angry with me, Mr.
Le Grande, I did not mean to offend you."</p>
            <p>"It's worse than offence, it is death," he replied.</p>
            <p>Ascending the steps of her uncle's house, by this
time reached, Leah extended her hand and said,
"Good-by. I'll tarry here to-night." Clasping her
soft hand, he said, "I shall see you soon. Good-night."</p>

            <p>A week after Madam Truxton's school closed, the
term of the military academy ended. The drilling,
drilling, drilling, was stopped, the graduating class of
cadets had either won or lost the honors for which
they contested; and the roll of candidates for military
honors was handed to the world. Conspicuous among
the names crowned with well-won distinction was that
of George Marshall. A nobler, braver spirit never
stepped from college walls upon life's crowded highway,
or one with firmer, truer tread than he.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
            <p>TIME rolled on. Months had melted into months
until they were calendared by years, since we
bade adieu to Madam Truxton's finishing class on
that departed June day 185—, and watched with regretful 
eye the last well-executed drill of the graduating cadets of the same year.</p>
            <p>Sunny twelvemonths only had so far passed over
these sundered friends, many of whom still clung to each
other with the old love of school days, and maintained
by frequent correspondence a thorough knowledge of
each other's lives and doings. It is worth mentioning
that these years had brought some changes to the lives
and fortunes of three of the four firm friends at
Madam Truxton's, and to others who were once sworn
friends at the institute.</p>
            <p>In her quiet home at Melrose, Lizzie Heartwell
was confronting daily the stern duties of life amid a
bevy of bright-eyed little scholars, wearing with easy
grace the dignity of school-mistress.</p>
            <p>Helen Le Grande, a bright fresh blonde in school
days, had blossomed into a fair, beautiful, fashionable
belle, as devoted to society as society was devoted to her.</p>
            <p>Bertha Levy, roguish and merry-hearted as ever,
had been sent abroad to complete her education in
Berlin—"To sober her down, and try and break her
spirit," as she wrote in a letter to Lizzie.</p>
            <pb n="82"/>
            <p>It was only the life of Leah Mordecai that apparently was 
marked by no change. She was older by a
few years—that was all the world saw of change in
her life. To strangers' eyes, she was still pursuing
the even tenor of her life, still wearing the melancholy
expression, and still envied by many for her wealth
and beauty. The eyes of the world could not read the
impoverished heart that throbbed within her bosom.</p>
            <p>On first leaving college, Emile Le Grande intended
to study law, and for months endeavored to concentrate 
his mind upon the prosaic, practical teachings of
Blackstone. The effort proved unsuccessful, and
then procuring employment in a well-established banking house, 
he applied himself to business with commendable assiduity. 
Yet alive in his heart was the
passion so long nourished for the beautiful Jewess.
He still lost no opportunity of assuring her again and
again of his unchanging devotion, and constantly endeavored, 
by tenderest utterances of love, to gain the
promise of her hand.</p>
            <p>This persistent homage, though avoided long by
Leah, became in time not unwelcome; and as month
after month passed on, she often whispered to herself,
"Struggle as I may against it, I do love him. Love
wins love, always, I believe."</p>
            <p>George Marshall, realizing the fulfilment of his
long-cherished dream, was in the active service of his
country, a captain in the regular army. Though he
was removed from his native State, no one who knew
him could doubt that he stood firmly, bravely at his post
of duty, ready to do his country's work at her bidding.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
            <p>"MY son," said Mrs. Abrams, in low, gentle tone
to Mark one day, as she looked into the small
library where he sat busily at work upon something
half-concealed in his hand, "come here a mimute,
won't you?"</p>
            <p>"Are you in a hurry, mother?" he replied, lifting
his black eyes, bright with an expression of determination, 
and resting them full upon his mother's
face.</p>
            <p>"No, not exactly, if you are busy; but what are
you doing?"</p>
            <p>"I'll tell you when I come in, and not keep you
waiting long either."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Abrams quietly withdrew, and returned to the
bedside of her little daughter Rachel, who lay suffering 
from pain and burning with fever.</p>
            <p>"What can mamma do for her darling now?"
said the fond mother, as she bent her head over her
child and smoothed back the fair hair from the heated
brow; "does your arm still hurt, my lamb?" The
child's moan was her only answer.</p>
            <p>"What a pity! How cruel that your dear little
arm should have been so torn by that savage dog!"
continued Mrs. Abrams, as she wet the bandage again
with the cooling lotion, and brushed away the tears<pb n="84"/>
that she could not repress at the sight of her little
daughter's suffering.</p>
            <p>The sound of footsteps, and Mark stood in the doorway, 
holding in his hand a small, dark object, and said:</p>
            <p>"Mother, do you see this? Well, I've got it
ready—"</p>
            <p>"O Mark!" interrupted his mother in horror.
"When did you get that deadly thing: I beg of you,
put that pistol up at once; the very sight of it terrifies me."</p>
            <p>Mark laughed and replied, "I'll fix old Dame
Flannagan's dog, mother, and then I'll put it away.
She hid the dog from the police, but she can't keep it
hid always. I shall kill it on sight, and go prepared to
do so. I have vowed I would."</p>
            <p>"Let the dog alone, son, you may get into trouble
if you do not," replied his mother.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, I will not let the dog alone," replied Mark
indignantly, as he drew nearer to the bed whereon the
suffering little sister lay, with lacerated arm and burning brow. 
"To think of this dear child, as she was
innocently trundling her hoop along the side-walk,
being attacked by that savage brute, and her life so
narrowly saved! Indeed, I'll not let it alone. I'll
shoot it the first time I set eyes upon it, and the old
hag had better not say anything to me after I have
done it. Poor little darling!</p>
            <p>"What shall brother Mark bring his little sister today?" 
continued the fond brother, stooping over and
kissing the child again and again, before leaving for the
office of the shipping firm, of which he had just been
made a partner.</p>
            <pb n="85"/>
            <p>"Yes, mother," he continued, slipping the weapon
of death into the inner pocket of his coat, "I am not
a warlike man, as you know, but I'll carry this," pointing 
to the pistol, "till I kill that dog, sure;" and adjusting 
his coat and hat he passed out of the house.</p>
            <p>Rabbi Abrams did not reside among the palatial
residences of the Queen City. A rather restricted income 
compelled him to find a more unpretentious home
than was perhaps in keeping with his avocation and
position in life. Yet, carrying into practice the teaching 
he set forth, to "owe no man anything," and never
live beyond one's income, he established his home in
a portion of the city that was rather characterized by
low rents than aristocratic abodes. However, they were
respectable, and comfortably situated withal. Immediately
adjoining the rabbi's house lived a garrulous old
Irish woman, at once the aversion and dread of the
neighborhood. Old Margery O'Flannagan needed no
protection against the incursions of depredators, beyond
the use of her own venomous tongue; still, she further
strengthened her ramparts by the aid of a dog of most
savage and ferocious propensities, that she dignified by
the ominous name of "Danger." Between her and
Danger there existed the strongest bond of friendship,
if not affection. In an unexpected manner, this savage
dog had assaulted the little daughter of the rabbi, and
when the father demanded the life of the dog at the
hands of the police, she hid him away out of reach,
and swearing like a pirate, threatened to kill any man
that dared molest Danger.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
            <p>LEAH MORDECAI sat alone in her bed chamber. 
A bright fire glowed within the grate, and
the gas-light overhead added its mellow brightness to
the apartment. Arrayed in a comfortable crimson silk
wrapper, the girl sat before the fire, with her slippered
foot upon the fender, and gazed steadily and thoughtfully 
into the fantastic coals. Without, the world was
cold and bright, for a pale, tremulous moon filled the
world with its beauty. The wind came in across the
sea, and mingling with the murmur of the waters,
produced a weird and ghost-like sound, as it swept
through half-deserted streets, penetrating rudely the
abodes of poverty, and whistling around the mansions
of the rich. This sound Leah heard faintly, as it
sought ingress at her windows, and down the half-closed chimney. 
She shuddered; yet it was not an unusual or a frightful sound, 
and not half so saddening as the sound that floated up the stairs: the sound
of low, sweet singing—Mark Abrams singing with
flute-like voice to her sister Sarah, who was soon, very
soon, expected to become his wife. Leah had heard
that voice before, had listened to its melody, attuned
to other words, and as she recalled the vanished time,
she trembled, shuddered, with an indefinable terror.</p>
            <p>As the sound of the music ceased, she arose and<pb n="87"/>
walked to the window. With both hands pressed
closely beside her face, so as to exclude every gleam
of light from within, she looked steadily out of the
window. All without was bright, and cold, and beautiful. 
White fleecy clouds drifted about the heavens,
like so many phantom barks upon the deep blue sea.</p>
            <p>"It's cold without and cold within," she muttered,
and then, as if startled by some sudden resolve, she
turned from the window back to a small escritoire,
saying:</p>
            <p>"Yes, I'll delay no longer. I must answer Lizzie's
letter and tell her all. My duties for the coming week
will be pressing, allowing me no opportunity for writing, 
equal to that of the present."</p>
            <p>Then she wrote:</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>"MY OWN CHERISHED FRIEND: To-night from my
casement I looked out upon the cold, bright world,
wrapped in moonlight, and as I gazed at the far-off
misty horizon, the distance called to mind my far-off
friend at Melrose—recalled to mind, too, the fact that
your last welcome letter has for an unwonted length of
time remained unanswered. Your letter that came on
the new year, came as the flowers of spring, always
fresh and beautiful. It has been neglected from the
inevitable press of circumstances by which I have
been surrounded, which neglect, I feel assured, you will
appreciate and forgive, when I have detailed the following facts.</p>
                     <p>"My sister Sarah is to be married in a week. This
approaching event has been the cause of my restricted<pb n="88"/>
time, pressing out of sight, and even out of memory,
all letter-writing.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, dear Lizzie, the long-expected nuptials are
actually about to be celebrated, and all our household,
except myself, are in a fever of excitement and delight.</p>
                     <p>"My step-mother is ecstatic over the success of
her scheming, and even condescends to be kind to me,—to
me, Lizzie, whom she has so long and so faithfully despised.</p>
                     <p>"My father, too, seems happy over this alliance,
knowing Mark's excellent character and business qualifications, 
and appreciating the connection with the
rabbi's family. Mark himself appears happy in the
hope of securing Sarah for his wife. But as to Sarah,
I can scarcely divine her feelings; she is too young and
light-hearted fully to comprehend the step before her.
She seems delighted with the occasion that bestows
upon her so many handsome presents; and beyond
this I think she scarcely casts a thought. The marriage will 
be solemnized at the synagogue, and the
reception held here at home. Mark has given Sarah
some elegant gifts, <emph>gifts that should be mine</emph>. Is it
wrong to write those words—words that contain so
much meaning? It may be; but as you know all,
dear Lizzie, I shall not erase them. And this reminds
me of something I must tell you, of another piece of
double-dealing and treachery imposed upon me by
Rebecca. Some weeks ago, my father's cousin, Baron
von Rosenberg, hearing of Sarah's approaching marriage—I have 
told you of this cousin before—sent over
a box of valuable presents for the children, all of us,
including Sarah, of course. Among the articles sent,<pb n="89"/>
were an elegant crimson velvet mantle, and a diamond
brooch. 'These,' wrote the baron, 'are for your
eldest daughter—Leah I believe.'</p>
                     <p>"My father gave the letter to his wife, supposing,
of course, that I would be allowed a perusal of it.
But instead she secreted the letter, and in disposing of
the gifts, said to me 'Here, Leah, is a handsome necklace, 
sent to you by the baron, and this elegant velvet
mantle and diamond brooch are for your sister Sarah—wedding 
presents. How kind of the baron to remember her so substantially!' 
'Yes,' said I, 'it was kind, and thoughtful too. I am glad that he has been
so generous. I certainly thank him for his remembrance of me.' 
I had no dream but that she was telling
me the truth, nor should I have suspected the deception, but, unfortunately, 
I overheard my father one day say, 'Rebecca, how did Leah like the mantle and
brooch the baron sent her?'</p>
                     <p>"'Oh, she thought them beautiful, as they are,'
was the quick reply; 'but like a generous girl—there
are few such—she begged her sister to keep them, as
suitable bridal gifts from her, as well as tokens of
her love.'</p>
                     <p>"'She's a dear unselfish creature,' replied my
father, with the credulity of a child; 'I never saw
another young person just like her. She's so deep
and hidden in her nature, one cannot easily read her
thoughts. I wish sometimes she was more open and
confiding; but she is a darling, for all her reticence.'</p>
                     <p>"'Yes, and loves Sarah to idolatry,' was the smooth,
well-put rejoinder.</p>
                     <p>"This much I heard, dear Lizzie, of the <orig>conversa-</orig>
                        <pb n="90"/>
tion, and then, with a horrified, sickening sensation, 
I flew away—flew away to solitude, and communion
with myself.</p>
                     <p>"I dared not undeceive my father; and as to the
gifts my heart cried out, 'Go, vain baubles, go? What
are diamonds and velvet to a desolate soul? Go, as
Mark Abrams, and many other things rightfully mine,
have gone from me—through treachery and fraud.'</p>
                     <p>"At this dreadful discovery, dear Lizzie, I longed
for your true heart, so warm with sympathy, but it
was far, far away, and no medium of communication
between us but the soulless, tearless pen. That was
inadequate then; now, the feeling has passed.</p>
                     <p>"But I crave your pardon for consuming so much
time and space upon myself and my woes. Forgive me.</p>
                     <p>"When the wedding is over I'll write you a full
and detailed account of it all.</p>
                     <p>"Did I tell you in my last of Bertha Levy?  She is
cultivating her voice in Berlin, and promises to become
a marvellous singer, they say. Would you ever have
thought she could be sober long enough to sing even
a short ballad? What a girl Bertha was!—real good
and kind though, despite her witchery.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, me! do you ever wish, Lizzie, you were a
school-girl again at Madam Truxton's? I do. I often
recall the song:

and am always sorrowful that my cry is unheeded by
this swift-footed monarch.</p>
                     <p>"I see Madam Truxton occasionally. She is
always engrossed, as you know, and the pressing duties<pb n="91"/>
to the new pupils exclude from her mind all remembrance 
of the old ones. Yet I love her, and always shall.</p>
                     <p>"I think I hear you asking, 'What of Emile?' and
in a few brief words I can reply. I still see him occasionally, 
and he still professes his unchanging love for
me. Forgive me, Lizzie; pardon what may seem in
me a weakness, but I must confess it, I believe I love
Emile. Firmly as I once promised you to shut my
heart against his overtures of love, I have slowly
but surely yielded my resolution, and now I can but 
frankly confess it. I do not think I shall ever marry
him. I have told him so again and again, and I believe 
I shall never surrender this resolve. I have
never told my father of Emile's devotion to me. I
have not deemed it necessary, as I do not intend to
marry him; and, then, I have been afraid to tell him.
I only meet Emile by chance, and but rarely. I know
you would advise me not to see him at all, and maybe
I will not in the future. Nous verrons.</p>

            <p>THE days passed on, and the night before the wedding hung 
its cold, starless gloom over the Queen
City—hung as the sable pall above the dead.</p>
            <p>"My dear," said Mrs. Abrams, as Mark on this
evening was preparing to leave his house for that of
his affianced, to make the last necessary arrangements
for the coming ceremony, "I wish you could be with 
me to-night. A mother's heart calls for the last evening 
of her son's free life, claims the last moments of
the time when she can call him exclusively her own.
To-morrow, dear boy, you are no longer mine. I
shall have only a secondary claim upon your love and
companionship, and must in the future console myself
with the knowledge, that in losing a mother my son has gained a wife."</p>
            <p>"O mother," replied Mark, with a troubled look,
"don't speak so. I am compelled to be at Mr. Mordecai's a 
little while to night, and also to call at Crispin's,
and see that my boot is stretched, and then I'll hasten
back. Tight boots on a wedding day, mother, will
not do at all, you know," added Mark playfully, as he
stroked the soft hair that waved back from the oval
Jewish face—a pale, gentle face it was.  "I'll be back
very soon."</p>
            <p>"Brother Mark, isn't you glad my arm is so well?<pb n="93"/>
Mother says I may go to the synagogue, too, to-morrow, 
and see you married," said the innocent little
sister, whose lacerated arm still hung in the snowy
bandage around her neck.</p>
            <p>"Yes, dovey, indeed I am," replied Mark, bending
down beside the fair child, and tenderly caressing her.
"If my little Rachel could not be there, brother Mark
would not consider himself well married. I am only
sorry that I haven't had a peep at that vicious dog
that hurt my darling so. Never mind, I am still ready
and waiting for his reappearance, and then I'll have
revenge.—Good-night, dear mother, I must go; a
sweet good-night to you and little Rachel—till I come
back." The young man stepped out into the cold,
dark night, and turned his face toward the elegant
home of the Jewish banker.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>"Umph! umph! dis is a hard night for old Peter—cold
wind, and no stars. People ought to 'preciate de
old carrier," grunted out rather than spoke, a rather
short, slightly bent old negro, as he stood peering curiously 
out of the window of the dimly lighted, misty
old printing-office of the "Queen City Courier." Then
turning around he shuffled toward the door, ejaculating, 
"Bad night on my rheumatiz;" and continuing,
as he descended the well-worn stairs, "de boss just give
me a little of de w'iskey bitters—w'iskey bitters mighty
good for de rheumatiz. Maybe when dey warm me
up good, I won't feel so stiff, and de cold won't pinch
so dreadful. Umph! umph! umph! ward number
two comes fust," and clutching the bundle of papers
more tightly, and gathering again the folds of the<pb n="94"/>
well-worn gray blanket around him, the old carrier
struck out, as briskly as the cold and his stiffened
limbs would allow, on his accustomed beat.</p>
            <p>It was three o'clock in the morning, and for an hour
he trudged on and on, past block and square, casting
the welcome household visitor, "The Courier," right
and left as he went. Suddenly he stopped a moment
to listen. "Dere, it's four o'clock," he said, as old St.
Luke's rang out the hour. "I'll soon be through dis
ward, an' in time for the up-town gentry too, as dey
takes breakfast late. Old Peter has a long round, but
he don't mind dat, so he gits de money. Den all de
quality knows old Peter, and how de hats come off and
de ladies smile when de New Year comes round again.
Humph! Jingo! How stiff dis knee! When old
Peter dead and gone, nebber find anodder carrier like
him. Peter nebber stop for nuffin, de rain nor de
shine, de northers nor de anything—umph! not even
de rheumatiz." Here the old man cut short his soliloquy,
stooping down to rub the afflicted member that
so retarded his progress, and whose pain was an ever-present
reminder that his agility and youth were gone
forever. Erecting himself, he began again, "Dis bin
a putty hard winter on mos' anybody, 'specially on de
rheumatiz. But for de w'iskey bitters of de boss, old 
Peter wouldn't be as spry is he is. Boss says, 'W'iskey bitters 
mighty good for <emph>anything</emph>,' an' I believe
him. Here it's Jinnivery, an' the winter mos' gone, an'
the rheumatiz will work out of me by next winter, an'
then I'll be as good as new again." By this time the
old carrier stood over against the Citadel Square, and
halting for a moment in his hobbling march, he looked<pb n="95"/>
right and left, backward and forward, and then said,
"Guess I'll save a block in going to Vine street, by
cutting through the Citadel Square—so I will. The
gates are always locked at this hour, but I know where
I can slip through under a loose plank, papers and all."
So saying, he hobbled across the street, found the
opening, and doubling himself up, went through it in
a trice. Then trudging on, he bethought himself
again of the sovereign remedy for all his ailments, 
"rheumatiz" especially, and he continued with evident delight:</p>
            <p>"Next winter w'iskey bitters will be good too, and
de boss will be shure to have 'nuff for us both. I
'spec' the boss teched wid de rheumatiz. I'll—Hallo!
w'at's dat?  Jes' git out ob my way, ole grunter. Dis
ole Peter."</p>
            <p>"Oh, God! help me! come here!" groaned a half
audible voice. "Come to me! help me! help me!"</p>
            <p>"O Lordy!" exclaimed old Peter as he jumped
back in sudden fright. "Who's dat? What you want?
W'at's de matter? I don't like spirits. You can't trick
me. I'm the carrier ob de Courier dese five an' twenty
year. What you want?"</p>
            <p>"O Lord! help me! Come to me, Peter. I know
you. I can do no harm. Come, I implore! Come
quickly!  Reassured by the faint, but importunate
words, old Peter approached the dark object that lay
upon the ground, scarcely discernible in the dim twilight of approaching day.</p>
            <p>"Bend down close to me, Peter. I am dying. I
am cold and faint, and wish to say a few words to
you."</p>
            <pb n="96"/>
            <p>"Good God!" and the old negro shuddered as he
bent down over the prostrate form before him.</p>
            <p>"Don't you know me, Peter?"</p>
            <p>Peter bent closer down.</p>
            <p>"Mass' Mark Abrams, is <emph>dis</emph> you? What's de matter 
wid you? Who did it? Who killed you? Tell
me; tell me for God's sake."</p>
            <p>"Listen to me, Peter; listen. I am dying—shot in
the breast with a pistol."</p>
            <p>"Who did it? Who did it? For Heaven's sake,
who did it?"</p>
            <p>"No one, Peter; be calm; listen to me. It was
accidental. I had in the inside pocket of my coat a
small pistol. In passing through here about eleven
o'clock, walking hastily homeward from Crispin's, I
stumbled by some chance, and as I fell the pistol was
discharged and has killed me. Here, take the pistol
quick, and run for my father. Be quick, man, quick,
that I may, if possible, say farewell. Take the pistol with
you. I am not strong enough to reach it. Be quick."</p>
            <p>Horrified, the old carrier groped on the ground for
it, and accidentally dipped his hand into the pool of
blood near the wounded man.</p>
            <p>"The devil? I hate blood? Dis is bad, bad, bad!
Mass' Mark! Mass' Mark!" No reply.</p>
            <p>"Mass' Mark! I b'lieve he's dead. I feared so.
Mass' Mark!" Still no reply.</p>
            <p>"O Lordy! I'll get away from here. De poor
child's dead, an' if I'm seen 'bout here dey may 'cuse
me of murder. I can't go an' tell nuffin. Ole Peter's
'fraid. I must git away;" and gathering up his papers
and the blanket again, he left the scene of the tragedy<pb n="97"/>
as rapidly as his disabled limbs would allow, feeling
as if some fearful ghost were in close pursuit. Unconsciously, 
he carried the pistol with him, and was
many squares away before he sufficiently collected his
bewildered and terrified faculties, to observe the deadly
weapon in his grasp. "What should he do with it?"
at once flashed through his brain, and as the brightening
daylight prevented his returning it to its place
beside the victim, he resolved to keep it. He dared
not cast it from him.</p>
            <p>As old Peter was too much frightened to reveal
the truth concerning the tragedy, he resolved at once
to keep the secret forever within his own breast, and
as he was guilty of no crime, he had no fears of the
mystery being revealed. So he went on in the advancing morning, 
on his long, tedious round of duty, and
no single reader that day missed the "Courier" or suspected 
the secret that lay hidden in the carrier's breast.
A few hours after the columns of the "Courier" had
been carefully scanned, on this January morning, an
"Extra" flashed from the press, and flooded the
Queen City with consternation and many hearts with
woe and lamentation. It ran thus:</p>
            <p>"Fearful tragedy! Mysterious assassination! Bridal day turned 
into a day of mourning and bitter disappointment!</p>
            <p>"This morning at an early hour the body of young
Mark Abrams was discovered, dead, and lying in a
pool of blood near the centre of the Citadel Square.
How he came to his death is still a mystery, but it
was undoubtedly by the hand of an assassin. The most
terrible fact connected with this sad calamity, is, that<pb n="98"/>
the day of the unfortunate man's death was to have
been his wedding day. He was to have married the
second daughter of Benjamin Mordecai, Esq., banker.
His body has been removed to the house of his father,
the worthy rabbi of Maple Street Synagogue. The
burial will take place this afternoon, at the hour appointed 
for the wedding ceremony. Seldom has the
Queen City been so shocked; and many heavy hearts
will to-day join in the wail of woe that goes up from
the stricken family."</p>
            <p>Thus the bulletin ran, and surmise, consternation,
and sorrow, were upon the lips of many men, women,
and children in the Queen City.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
            <p>MELROSE, Lizzie Heartwell's home, was a manufacturing village 
in the northern part of a Southern State. A more picturesque or inviting spot
is seldom found. It crowned the summit of one of a
range of long, sloping hills, that stretched back from
a river, as a diadem crowns the brow of a monarch.
The snowy houses, nestled amid the clustering foliage,
and the carefully trimmed hedge-rows, imparted to
the place an English air of aristocratic seclusion. The
clear silver river, too, which turned the spindles of
the far-famed factories, encircled this romantic village
as a mother the child of her love. These factories,
that had been in successful operation for nearly a quarter of a century, 
gave employment to scores of honest,
industrious people, that otherwise might have gone
scantily clad and miserably fed, perhaps have perished.</p>
            <p>Mr. Caleb Schuyler, the superintendent and proprietor of 
these factories, was a large-hearted New
Englander, who had brought to this Southern State
his native thrift and enterprise, and had spent a useful
and comparatively long life in the work of building
up and improving Melrose. Enough intelligence and
wealth had gathered there to make the religious and
educational advantages desirable, if not superior. The
houses were all well kept and attractive, and Melrose<pb n="100"/>
was a charming place to live in, although remote
from railways or steamboats.</p>
            <p>In the eastern part of the village, where the winding road began 
its gentle descent to the river, stood a
plain, but comfortable and commodious school-room.
It was erected years ago for a "Yankee school teacher"; 
now it was occupied by Lizzie Heartwell, who had
been a favorite scholar of that same teacher years before, 
when she was a very little girl. Consumption
had long since laid that teacher to rest, and time
had brought that fair-haired little girl to fill her place.</p>
            <p>Over the bevy of factory-children, and those gathered from the 
wealthier families too, Lizzie Heartwell
now presided with great dignity and grace, as school-mistress. 
In this sphere of life, her faculties of mind,
soul, and body, found full scope for perfect development.
Fond of children, loving study, happy always to help
those desiring knowledge, glad to enlighten the ignorant, 
Lizzie Heartwell was happy, and useful too, in
the work in which she was employed. It was now
more than three years since Lizzie left Madam Truxton's, and she was 
now ending the second year of her teaching. It was September. 
The woods were dying earlier than usual, in the golden Indian summer.
The days were sweet and delicious, and Melrose was
as attractive in its autumn loveliness as it had been
in the freshness of spring. It was toward the close of
one of those charming September days, when Lizzie
Heartwell stepped to the door of her school-room
to watch the descending sun, and to see if she were
detaining the children too long. Instantly her attention was 
arrested by the rumbling of the tri-weekly<pb n="101"/>
stage-coach, toiling up the hill before her. For a
moment she stood watching its slow approach, apparently unmindful 
of the class that was already "in line"
upon the floor, eagerly awaiting the last recitation,
which would set them free. And yet the school-mistress gazed at the 
stage-coach, which had at last reached the top of the hill, 
and the horses, as if under
new inspiration, were jogging along in a brisk trot,
and were rapidly approaching the school-house. Suddenly the face 
of the young school-mistress grew pale,
and then crimson, as she caught a glimpse of a face
that leaned wearily beside the coach-door and looked
out—a face not unfamiliar, and yet not well-remembered; a handsome, 
manly face, overshadowed by a
military cap—and like a sudden flash came the thought
that she had seen that face before. Regaining her
self-possession, Lizzie turned from the door, examined
the spelling-class as calmly as ever, commended all for
their perfection in recitation, and with a blessing dismissed the 
eager little band for the day.</p>
            <p>"Who was it?" she muttered, as she slowly donned
the jaunty hat and her mantle, and mechanically drew
on her kid gauntlets, preparatory to starting homeward. "I have seen 
that face before, I think, and yet
I am not sure. Can it possibly be George Marshall?"
she said slowly. "If so, time has changed him, yet
only to improve, I think. How the thought of ever
seeing George Marshall again startles me! But I am
foolish, very foolish, to imagine such an absurd thing.
Oh, no, he will never come to Melrose. I wish he
would," and she began singing a low love-ditty half-unconsciously, 
half-fearfully, as she trudged homeward.</p>
            <pb n="102"/>
            <p>An hour later, and a perfumed billet-doux bore to
the widow's cottage the compliments of Captain
George H. Marshall, U. S. A. He had, indeed, come
to Melrose at last.</p>
            <p>Obtaining a limited leave of absence from the
army, he had come home to visit his kindred, and his
friend at Melrose. The time was necessarily short.
Only one week could he spend at Melrose—one short
seven days—days crowned with a golden halo in the
after years. To the young school-mistress these were
days bright with hope and happiness, bright as
the effulgent sun that ushered them in, one by one.
Days, too, that she parted with regretfully, as each
one's sun went down. Six of these golden days were
passed—passed in pleasant converse, in singing, in
reading, in hoping, and the seventh was drawing nigh.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Marshall," said Lizzie, on the evening of
the sixth day, "will you leave Melrose without seeing my school, 
and telling me what you think of my avocation?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly not, if you will allow me the pleasure,
and to-morrow is the only time I have left," he
replied.</p>
            <p>"Well, then, come to-morrow if you like, and see
me enthroned in my kingdom. My school opens at
eight o'clock, for in this country we teach a long,
honest day. Our people know nothing of the five-hour
system," she replied merrily.</p>
            <p>"Then, Miss Heartwell, if you will grant me the
pleasure, I'll call early in the morning, and we'll stroll
by the river-side. I must tell you further of my coming to Melrose, 
and then I'll see you in your field of<pb n="103"/>
labor. Will you grant me this last request?" the young
man demanded nervously.</p>
            <p>"I will, with pleasure," she replied. "I'll be ready
by seven o'clock, and I'll show you the place where
tradition says an Indian maiden jumped from the bluff
into her lover's waiting skiff below, to elude her angry
father's pursuit, and lost her life on the rocks."</p>
            <p>"That was sad! 'Love's sacrifice' indeed, at a
terrible cost!" replied the young man thoughtfully.
"I trust I'll be more successful some day than the Indian
lover was."</p>
            <p>Lizzie trembled, and turning her eyes upon a vase
of wild-flowers that adorned the simple table, replied
confusedly, "Poor Wenona! hers was a sad fate."</p>
            <p>"To-morrow, at ten o'clock, the stage-coach leaves.
I can see you a while in the morning, can I? So
I'll bid you good night," and George Marshall arose
and extended his hand.</p>
            <p>"Good night!" murmured Lizzie, with a sinking
sensation at her heart, and a dimness of vision that
almost betrayed tears.</p>
            <p>Night passed, and morning came—bright, clear,
fresh morning; and the young girl was awake with
the dawn.</p>
            <p>"Ah me!" she sighed, as she arranged the shining
curls before her simple mirror, "this is the last day.
I am almost sorry he ever came to Melrose. I was so
interested in my school before; now, I fear I'll be
always thinking of the army. Yes, I'll put on this blue
ribbon—he likes blue, he admired the blue 'forget-me-not'
I wore at Madam Truxton's the first night I ever
met him. And these violets I'll pin on my bosom,<pb n="104"/>
they are blue too. I am a silly girl, I fear; and yet
there is a strange aching at my heart. Can it be— 
Alas! I cannot speak it. Seven o'clock! He's coming!
yes, he is here! I hear him on the step."</p>
            <p>George Marshall looked pale and troubled, as he
bade adieu to Mrs. Heartwell and stepped forth from
her neat white cottage on this cool September morning, 
accompanied by the young school-mistress. His
thoughtful face bore the impress of a sleepless night,
and he was taciturn and abstracted. By his side Lizzie chatted away, 
as though bribed to dispel the gloom
and silence that threatened to surround them—chatted
as though no other feeling than gayety filled her own
fearful heart—chatted till a curve in the white sandy
road brought them in view of the river, and under
a cluster of wide-spreading water-oaks that overshadowed 
a broken mass of stone.</p>
            <p>"Miss Heartwell," said George abruptly, "sit here
beside me, on these moss-covered rocks, before we go
any farther, and let me tell you something I've kept
unspoken long enough. Will you?"</p>
            <p>Lizzie made no reply, but timidly followed where
he led, and sat beside him on the lichen-covered stones.
As George Marshall looked up, a tear stole from her
true blue eyes, and moved by this evidence of emotion, 
he said with deep-toned pathos:</p>
            <p>"Miss Heartwell, I love you, and you know it.
If it were not a sin against the great God, I would say
I adore you. May I not hope that those crystal tears
betray the existence of a kindred love for me? Nothing but love, 
unalloyed and pure, love for yourself,
ever brought me to Melrose. May I go away with<pb n="105"/>
the assurance that my love is returned, and bearing in
my heart the hope to come again some day, and claim
you as my wife? May I?"</p>
            <p>The tears still flowed from the pure fountain of
Lizzie's innocent, tender heart, and her head bowed
as gently as a lily in the gale, but she answered firmly,
sweetly, truly, "Yes, I love you too, and I promise,
with God's blessing, one day to become your wife."</p>
            <p>"Wipe away those tears then, and let me see, in
the depth of your innocent eyes, that your promise is
solemn and unchanging."</p>
            <p>"As my soul is undying, I am in earnest; and as
Heaven is true, I shall be faithful to your love. Never
doubt me. Here, take these innocent flowers, modest
children of the wild-wood—these violets, as a pledge of
my unfeigned love;" and unclasping the golden brooch,
she let the delicate flowers fall into the open hand of
her lover.</p>
            <p>Gathering up the offerings of affection, George
Marshall clasped the slender hand that gave them, 
and imprinting a fervent kiss upon it, said, "God
bless you, my darling, and take this as the seal of my
benediction."</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>When the tri-weekly coach rolled out of Melrose
on that charming autumn day, and passed the schoolhouse 
of the maiden, the sigh she cast after it was not
without hope, and the one the lover wafted back
breathed a promise to come again some day, not far
off, and take her away from that school-room forever.</p>

            <p>THE terrible tragedy that had filled so many hearts
with consternation, the untimely and mysterious
death of Mark Abrams, had long since been numbered
with the events of the past. In the Hebrew burial
ground, in a suburb of the Queen City, his mortal
remains were at rest. Months ago, the grass had
sprung, and the flowers of affection blossomed above
his pulseless bosom. Upon the seventh day of every
week since that dreadful January, the unhappy father
and mother had turned their faces devoutly toward
the city of their fathers, and offered their fervent
prayers. Yet no abatement of sorrow had time brought
to the mother's wounded, bleeding heart. Wearily,
and often despairingly, she longed for that untried,
unknown life beyond, where she dimly hoped for a reunion with her lost son.</p>
            <p>Sarah Mordecai, young, thoughtless, volatile, in
the death of her lover was disappointed, but not heartbroken. 
Recovering from the shock of her sorrow
with the buoyancy and elasticity of youth, her repinings 
scarcely reached beyond the period that brought
blossoms to the resting-place of the dead. Let no one
censure this young heart that, by reason of its nature,
could not sit enshrouded in gloom and sorrow, nor
shudder at the thought that when the summer came,<pb n="107"/>
with warmth and brightness, she was as light of heart
as the birds that carolled in the garden around her
spacious home.</p>
            <p>Not such the mourning of her disappointed mother.
From day to day, since the failure of her cherished
hope, regret and disappointment had rankled in her
bosom with consuming force. She despised the fate
that foiled her plans and purposes, and left the object
of her hatred still uncrushed. Leah, with her beauty
and unaffected grace, was again to be triumphed over.
Again she might not be so successful. Rebecca was
cold, cruel, and false—Leah fearful, dispirited, and
miserable. Alas! poor Leah Mordecai.</p>

as Belle Upton was; and if she was in love with me, it
was without a cause.' I have paid her some attention,
but only to please mother and Helen. She's too effeminate, 
if she is so very aristocratic—not half so handsome as 'ma belle Juive.' 
Oh! those dreamy eyes! They haunt me day and night. I believe I am sick
with love!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 30.—This has been a memorable month to
me. Last night, in the starlight, as I walked home
with Leah from the Battery, she promised to marry
me; <emph>yes, actually to marry me!</emph>  Said she was unhappy 
at home—I wonder why—and would marry
me in self-defence, if from no other cause. A tear
stood in her dark eyes as she said, with stern, hoarse
voice, '<emph>If you love me, Emile, truly love me, and will
be faithful to me, I will forsake all others and marry
you.</emph>' Then she made me swear it—swear it there, in
the face of the blue heavens and the glittering stars.
I tremble when I think of my parents' displeasure,
but then I love the girl, and shall fulfil my vow,
even unto death. In a month I shall be twenty-five years old, 
and before another birth-day rolls
around, after this one, I shall be a married man—married
to the girl I love, Leah Mordecai, the Jewess.
I wonder what the world will say. But I don't care;
love knows no barriers. When my plans are a little
more defined, I shall mention the matter seriously to
my father. Mother will not hear to it, I know.
And then; if he is willing, <emph>all well</emph>; if he is <emph>not</emph> 
willing, all <emph>well</emph> still. I shall marry her."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
            <p>LEAH MORDECAI sat alone in the southern balcony of her father's 
house one night in this same
memorable August, the events of which were so fully
recorded in Emile's diary—sat alone enjoying the warm
silver moonlight that flooded all the world about her—sat
alone, thinking, dreaming, fearing, vaguely hoping.
Suddenly the sound of her mother's voice reached her
from an adjoining room, and arrested her attention.
Involuntarily she listened. "Yes, dear husband, Leah
is anxious to go—unhappy even, at the fear of being
denied."</p>
            <p>"You surprise me, Rebecca," replied the fond husband and father; 
"I never dreamed that Leah desired
to visit Europe. She has never mentioned it to me."</p>
            <p>"No, nor will she ever. She fears your displeasure,
shrinks from betraying a desire to be separated from
you, even for a short period of time; but still she longs
to go. Ever since Bertha Levy went to Berlin, she
has cherished a secret desire to go, too. You well
know that music is the passion of her soul, and Leah
longs for culture which she cannot obtain in this
country."</p>
            <p>"Dear child!" exclaimed the father, "she shall
be gratified in her desires, and study in the fatherland
as long as she chooses. She has always been a good,<pb n="110"/>
obedient, loving daughter, and deserves to be rewarded." 
Then he added, after a moment's pause, 
and with ill-concealed emotion, "Yes, my daughter is 
always obedient and kind, yet a shade too sober for
one so young; but her mother was always thoughtful, dear woman, 
and I suppose it's the child's inheritance." Mr. Mordecai sighed. 
And Rebecca, discerning the drift of his thought, recurred quickly to
the subject, saying:</p>
            <p>"Well, my husband, what arrangement can you
make for Leah's going? Of course you cannot accompany her."</p>
            <p>"That's easily done," he replied. "Every week
there are persons going direct to Europe from this very
city; and, by the way, my friend Solomon Stettheimer
expects to go soon to Wirtemberg, to look after an
estate of a deceased relative, and I could safely intrust
Leah to his care. I shall write at once to my cousin,
the baron, and have her placed under his care."</p>
            <p>"That's a wise plan, my husband, and will give
Leah great joy. Make it known to her as though it
was only a pleasant surprise you were offering her, not
mentioning the fact that I acquainted you with her
wishes."</p>
            <p>"So I will, kind little heart, good little woman
that you are," replied Mr. Mordecai affectionately, as
he stroked Rebecca on the arm.</p>
            <p>Leah heard no more. Shocked and terrified at
this treacherous plotting, she stole softly from the balcony, 
passed through the side garden, entered the
house by the rear door, and hastened away to her own
chamber up stairs.</p>
            <pb n="111"/>
            <p>"Merciful Heaven! what a lie, to deprive me of my
father's love, and send me from my home, among
unknown friends, so far away! I cannot, cannot go;
I cannot leave my father, even though it kill me to
remain," gasped the young girl, in tears and bitterness
of heart, as she sank helpless and hopeless upon the
snowy bed that stood, a monster ghost, in the moonlit chamber. 
For hours she lay in silence and in
sorrow, and when sleep came at length, the spoken
words of her slumber but revealed the burden of her
heavy heart in the oft-repeated words, "I cannot, cannot, <emph>will</emph> not go."</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <pb n="[112]"/>
            <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
            <p>A WEEK passed. No word concerning the projected journey had 
been spoken by her father, and the young girl was beginning 
to hope that it might have been only the burden of an idle 
conversation, not a project really determined upon by either
parent. But early one morning, as Mr. Mordecai
caught the sound of music floating out from the drawing-room—such tender 
music—he laid aside the paper he
was reading, and slipped softly toward the room whence
came the sounds. This sudden and unusual manifestation of 
musical skill, this morning outburst of melody, astonished 
the father, and his approach to the
drawing-room was as much from surprise as for the
pleasure of a nearer enjoyment of his daughter's skilful performance. 
Unconscious of any approaching
footstep, Leah sat, pale and statuesque, at the elegant
instrument, and drew forth, at intervals, strains of
witching melody. The absorbed expression of her
emotionless face told plainly that music was the one
channel through which the pent-up feelings of her
heart found an outlet. How often is this divine art
the unsyllabled expression of a miserable, or an overjoyed heart.</p>
            <p>"My daughter," at length said Mr. Mordecai tenderly, 
after standing for some moments unobserved
behind Leah.</p>
            <pb n="113"/>
            <p>"Is it you, father?" she replied, turning suddenly 
around, "I did not hear you come in."</p>
            <p>"No, my love, I came softly that I might not disturb you; 
came to thank you for the sweet music
that in this early morning sounds—so heavenly, I will
say. Play me something else, as sweet and tender as
the sonata you have just finished, and then come here
and sit beside me; I have something to tell you."</p>
            <p>"With all my heart, father," Leah replied, rising
and turning through a mass of music. "Shall it be a
song, father?"</p>
            <p>"By all means, my dear."</p>
            <p>And drawing forth the well-worn pages of Beethoven's "Adelaide," 
the young girl reseated herself, and sang.</p>
            <p>The tender words of her father, as well as the ominous ones, 
"I have something to tell you," startled Leah,
and caused the chords of love and fear to vibrate wildly
within her bosom. Yet she concealed her deeper
feelings, and sang—beautifully, bravely, sweetly—the
tender, ravishing love-ditty which she knew was her
father's favorite. The melody died away, the chords
relaxed and hushed their sweetness, and Leah turned
toward her father, awaiting the words of commendation 
that he always awarded to her performances.
But he was silent. Seated upon a divan near by,
Mr. Mordecai presented a striking appearance, which
Leah at once observed. He was attired in his crimson
morning-gown, adorned with golden bordering, and
wore a becoming scarlet cap carelessly adjusted upon
his head; a golden tassel hung from the cap beside the
thoughtful face, and the half-snowy beard which spread<pb n="114"/>
like a silken fringe upon his bosom. His head was  
half-averted, and the sharp black eyes seemed to rest
immovably upon some central figure on the luxurious
tapestry. He was so absorbed that he heeded not
the cessation of the music, nor was he aroused from
his abstraction till Leah seated herself beside him
and said:</p>
            <p>"Now, father, I am ready to hear you."</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, daughter, if I seem unmindful of
your charming song; but thoughts for your welfare
filled my reverie."</p>
            <p>"What thoughts, father?" Leah asked fearfully.</p>
            <p>"Well, listen to me. I have planned for you,
my daughter, a most delightful and profitable journey.
Assured that you possess musical talent of the highest
order, I desire that talent to be most highly cultivated.
The culture you need cannot be obtained in this country; 
so I have written to my cousin, Baron von Rosenberg, 
to have you become a member of his distinguished family 
for a time. Under his care and direction, your studies 
can be pursued to the greatest advantage. What do you think of the arrangement?"</p>
            <p>As Mr. Mordecai was unfolding what he supposed
would be a pleasant surprise to his daughter, he marked
the serious, even pained expression of her face, and
wondered at it.</p>
            <p>Leah was silent. Then, with an air of surprise
and disappointment, her father repeated the inquiry.
"What do you think of my plan? You cannot possibly dislike it, my daughter!"</p>
            <p>"Saxony is a great way off from you, dear father—I
believe the baron lives in Saxony. I do not think<pb n="115"/>
I could be happy so far away from you, the only living human 
being who loves me truly in this cold world." The last words were spoken bitterly.</p>
            <p>"Your words astonish me, my child; they savor
of ingratitude, and are strange words for your lips.
What can you mean?"</p>
            <p>Leah trembled that so much had escaped her
hitherto silent lips, betraying even faintly the true
feeling of her heart; and repressing the words that
would have followed had her father not offered his
rebuke, she replied quickly:</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, dear father, if I seem ungrateful;
perhaps I do not appreciate the love I enjoy; but I do
not wish to go so far away from you. And you will
not send me, will you?"</p>
            <p>"Never trouble about me, my daughter; go and
stay a year, if no longer; that's a short period of time,
when it is past. Go for the improvement you will
get. Go and become distinguished, my child;" and
the ambitious parent's eye kindled with a new light
at the thought.</p>
            <p>Leah made no reply, and the father, releasing the
delicate hand he had so tenderly held, said again and
again, "Never mind me, child, never mind me; a
year's a short time. Go and become distinguished."</p>
            <p>The banker went to his counting-house that day,
elated with the project for his daughter's pleasure and
improvement, little dreaming where, or for what purpose, 
this plan was conceived; and Leah spent its
lonely hours in sorrow and in tears.</p>

            <p>"I HAVE been in such a maze of suspense and
bewilderment for a month, dear Journal, that I
have neglected you; to-night I'll recall, if I can,
some of my lost days. No, I can't. It makes no diference; 
they were only days of trouble. I am perplexed to death to
know the result of the baron's letter. He wrote, of course, 
and urged that Mr. Mordecai send Leah at once to him. 
And the preparations are going rapidly forward for her departure. 
Every day I say, 'Darling, stay with <emph>me</emph>,' and her father
says, 'Daughter, you <emph>must</emph> go.' 'We shall see, in the
end, what the end will be.'</p>
            <p>"<hi>October</hi> 15.—To-night, dear Journal, I make the
most triumphant record of my life. Tell it not,
breathe it not, to a mortal soul! Leah, my darling,
has promised to marry me, and not go to Europe, as
her father had determined. She told me last night,
when I met her in the park, that her mind was made
up. <emph>She would not go</emph>. She did not wish to go, and
to marry me was her only alternative. She loves me,
though, and we shall be happy, I am sure. My parents are 
bitterly opposed, and hers will be, to such a
union, but we will be married, for all that. Helen<pb n="117"/>
alone is in my confidence; she has none of that pride
that revolts at Leah's being a Jewess. To-morrow
I leave for Havana, where I go with papers from our
banking house to a branch house in that city. If I
am successful in making my business arrangements, as
I feel assured I shall be, then all will be well. I can
only remain two days, as the day for Leah's embarkation 
is not a fortnight off. My mother and father
know nothing of the business that takes me away, yet
I have not deceived them. But, Journal, good night.</p>
            <p>"<hi>October</hi> 28.—Home again from Havana—home
with bounding heart and glowing hopes. I admire
that fine City of the Antilles almost as much as I do
my beloved, native Queen City. I shall enjoy my new
home, I know. How could I do else than enjoy it?
With a satisfactory salary in our branch house, and a
lovely young wife, a heathen might well be happy.
Now, old Mordecai can keep his gold, if he likes, and
ny father can do the same. The opposition has driven
me to rely more implicitly upon myself, thank the
fates. I shall be able to 'paddle my own canoe.'
Leah looks something like those Spanish beauties, only
she's a trifle sadder in expression. I trust she'll be
happy in her new home, amid Cuban bloom and under
azure skies. Heaven grant her an unclouded life. I
am delirious with joy; and for fear of committing too
much to your keeping, Journal, I'll stop writing.
Adieu."</p>

            <p>"AUNT BARBARA," said Leah, the day before
the proposed departure of the vessel that was
to bear her away, "will you tell Mingo to leave the
key of the lodge hanging just inside the inner door to-night. 
I may be coming in, or going out late, and he 
need not be disturbed, if he will do that." These words 
were addressed to a middle-aged colored woman, who, 
with high-turbaned head, moved busily about Leah's 
apartment, folding garments and packing trunks, and
sighing, ever and anon, as though enduring heart-felt
grief at the prospect of the approaching parting.</p>
            <p>"Yes, dear chile, I'll tell him, if you wish. Dere
is not many more times for your dear feet to pass in
and out of de lodge;" and accompanying these simple,
pathetic words was an outburst of honest tears, that
fell upon the tidy white apron which the kind soul
held to her eyes.</p>
            <p>"Will you miss me, Aunt Barbara, when I am
gone?" said Leah, deeply moved by the old colored
woman's manifestation of sorrow.</p>
            <p>"Law, chile, God only knows how ole Aunt Barbara 
will miss you. But I'll pray de good Lord to
keep you safe from harm, when you are so far away,
and bring you back to us again, one day."</p>
            <p>"Suppose I never come back, Aunt Barbara; will
you ever forget me?"</p>
            <pb n="119"/>
            <p>The old woman made no reply, but her ponderous frame 
shook convulsively, with excessive emotion. Leah then
approached this faithful friend, and
laying her arm around her neck, said tenderly, "Don't
cry so, Aunt Barbara, but cheer me with the hope
that some day I'll come back to you." The sound
of approaching footsteps in the hall dried Aunt
Barbara's tears, and when she opened the door in response 
to a gentle tap, her face was as placid as a summer lake.</p>
            <p>"Is it you, father? Come in," said Leah, looking
up to meet her father's eye.</p>
            <p>"Yes, my daughter. Are you ready? Are the
trunks packed? Can I do anything more for you?"
replied Mr. Mordecai, almost in one breath.</p>
            <p>"Nearly ready, father. Aunt Barbara has about
finished the last one, and I am ready to leave you."</p>
            <p>These words, so full of feeling, so sorrowfully
spoken, too, struck deep into the father's heart, and
filled him with unspeakable regret.</p>
            <p>"Ready to leave me, daughter," he reiterated, half
petulantly, "I fear that you do not appreciate, or
rather that you misinterpret my motive in sending
you on so grand a journey. How many girls there
are who vainly wish, from day to day, for such advantages as I am offering you!"</p>
            <p>To these words Leah made no reply. And Mr.
Mordecai, walking backward and forward with restless step 
across his daughter's bed-chamber, secretly
regretted that he had ever considered the project for
a moment. Then he said, half apologetically, "You<pb n="120"/>
shall only stay a year, my daughter; that is not such a
very long time."</p>
            <p>"Maybe I shall never come back, father. But you
will love me always, won't you?"</p>
            <p>"Hush! hush! child. I do not like your words.
They distress me! A year is a short time, you know;
so don't be foolish. Come, braid up your hair,
arrange your dress, and come down at once into the
drawing-room. I must have some music to-night."</p>
            <p>"With pleasure, dear father," answered Leah, as 
cheerfully as the swelling emotion at her heart would 
allow. Then, in an undertone to herself, she added, "It
may be the last time I shall have the privilege of playing 
for him in my life. If I were to go to Europe, that
wretched woman would devise some plan to keep me
there, and so I'll stay with—" the last word she uttered
was spoken in a whisper, and scarce escaped her lips.
Hastily obeying her father's summous, after 
arranging a becoming toilet, Leah descended to the drawing-room,
where Mr. Mordecai awaited her. "Father,"
said Leah abruptly, as she was turning to her music,
"to-day, in looking over a package of papers, I came
across the cards of cousin Hannah Stuyvesant; I had
not thought of her for ever so long. Who was it she
married?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! A Christian dog! A renegade. Somebody
named Bliss, I believe."</p>
            <p>"Did they prosper, father?"</p>
            <p>"I'll venture to say not, but I do not know positively. 
I've known nothing of her since she so far
renounced her people as to marry a Christian. Neither
have I desired to know anything of her."</p>
            <pb n="121"/>
            <p>At these words of Mr. Mordecai—significant words—Leah
stationed herself at the instrument, and, with
mind absorbed, and thoughts far away from the music,
she performed mechanically piece after piece, as her
father would request. The tea-bell at last summoned
the family to the evening meal, and encircling his
daughter with his arm, Mr. Mordecai led the way to
the waiting repast. This was the last evening meal of
the banker's family, unbroken. Yet who could have
said so on that memorable evening in the long ago?</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
            <p>NIGHT gathered around the Queen City with
dark and sombre fold, after the chilly October
day previous to the one appointed for Leah Mordecai's
departure for Europe—a night whose ominous gloom
seemed to pervade the innermost apartment of the
banker's home. It was late before Mr. Mordecai could
spare his daughter from his presence, and give the
good-night kiss, his usual benediction before they separated 
for slumber. Even the wily Rebecca said good
night now in a tender tone, and gave Leah a gracious
smile as she ascended the stairs for the last time. "It
is the last," thought she, "for many a long day, maybe
forever, and I can smile in sincerity. Once gone, I'll
see to it that she never comes again. Aha! I am happy
now, and can smile in joy and truth."</p>
            <p>Once more within her quiet chamber, Leah locked
the door and stood a moment with frightened face gazing 
furtively around the room. All was silent. The
beating of her own wild heart was all the sound she
heard. Then sinking down from actual weakness, she
sat a moment as if summoning the last spark of courage 
in her timid, fearful soul and said, "Yes, it is a
dreadful alternative, but I am driven to it. If I obey
my father, and go to Europe, I know I shall not return
for many years, if ever. If I am to be separated from<pb n="123"/>
my father, it shall not be by that woman's scheming.
She has devised this plan to send me from my home,
and she shall be disappointed. I am assured that Emile
loves me, yet I should never have married him had I
not been forced to do so—simply because he is not a
Jew. But as it is, I take the step deliberately, firmly
resolved to abide the consequences, be they good or evil.
Yes, I am resolved to take this first step in disobedience
to my father's wishes. I cannot help it. It has caused
me terrible suffering to reach this decision, but circumstances 
press me to it. Now, it is irrevocable. God
forgive me, if I cause my father sorrow! He knows how
I love and serve him, and Heaven knows how cruelly
I have been dealt with. But time is passing. I must
write a last, fond letter to my dear Lizzie; tell her of
this final, desperate step in my life, and beg that her
love, so long tried, may follow me still through the
untried life that lies before me, be it a life of sunshine
or of shadow.</p>
            <p>"Oh! the thought is dreadful. Let me see. Now
the hour is eleven. Emile will come at twelve. I
must hasten;" and rising from her recumbent posture,
Leah replaced the watch within her bosom, and
seating herself at the escritoire, wrote a last, loving
letter to the friend of her school-days. This she
dropped into her pocket, that she might post it at the
lodge. Then she wrote, with trembling hand and
faltering heart, a farewell message to her beloved
father; and she was done. In a small portmanteau
she had carefully packed the few things requisite
for her clandestine journey. The well-filled trunks
were safely locked, and the keys hanging idly upon<pb n="124"/>
the ring in her work-basket. "These trunks," she
murmured to herself, as she glanced around the room
preparatory to leaving it, "will descend to my sister,
or go to Europe, or, maybe, will be destroyed. I shall
never use their contents. Dear Aunt Barbara's careful packing 
was all to no purpose, had she only known 
it. Kind Aunt Barbara! Now, one thing more
remains to be done. I must have my mother's miniature before 
I quit my father's house, perhaps forever. 
Aunt Barbara has secured the key of the cabinet for
me, and it lies secreted in one of the drawers. Yes,
Rebecca has kept it from me for nearly five years. 
How I burn with anger yet, to think of the cruel lie
that took from me the only gift I ever valued in my
life! That perfidious bosom shall never feel the
pressure of that precious, jewelled face again. No, in
heaven's name, I will not leave without it!"</p>
            <p>"Hush! the citadel clock strikes the quarter to
twelve! Dear old room!  Chair, bed, books, pictures—all, farewell!"</p>
            <p>The house below was silent. The lights had been
darkened for an hour. With stealthy step along the
upper hall, and silent footfall on the stairway, the
cloaked and hooded figure of Leah approached the
sleeping apartment of her father and his wife. The
sound of heavy breathing betokened heavy slumber,
as she silently turned the door-knob and stood within
the chamber. Reassured by this sound, she glided
toward the cabinet, and noiselessly adjusting the key,
turned it gently in the lock. The white, delicate
finger stole softly about the first smoothly polished
drawer, to find it empty. Then one and another<pb n="125"/>
underwent, in quick succession, the same noiseless
inspection, till the fourth and last drawer was reached;
and that one yielded up the coveted treasure. Hastily
placing it in her bosom, she closed the drawer, and
then glided out as softly as she had glided into the
room. On the threshold she cast back one fond, lingering 
look at the dimly outlined figure of her father,
as he lay before her in unconscious slumber. "Heaven
ever shield him," she whispered softly; and passed on—on
and out beyond the heavily-bolted front door—out
forever! In the starlight, chill and faint, she
found herself, with trembling limbs and trembling
heart, and for a moment sat down on the cold stone
step to rally her failing strength and courage before
she sought the lodge. At the sound of approaching
wheels she arose, and walked with rapid step to the
lodge, reaching it just as a coach drew up before it.</p>
            <p>"Is it you, Emile?" said Leah softly, as the lodge
door opened and a manly form appeared.</p>
            <p>"Yes, darling. Thank fortune, your courage has
not failed you. I have been feverish with anxiety and
impatience for hours. Are you ready, dear?"</p>
            <p>At these words Leah trembled, and faltered "Yes."</p>
            <p>"Well, I thought it best to bring the minister
with me, and so my friend Bishop Leveret is in the
carriage. Suppose we have the ceremony performed
here; then there can be no possible disappointment
or danger. Are you afraid?"</p>
            <p>"What have I to fear now, when I have gone so
far? I abide now by your wishes in all matters, henceforth 
and forever. I am ready."</p>
            <p>In a moment the bishop was summoned. By the<pb n="126"/>
light of a dimly burning lantern, he drew forth the
Prayer Book, and read the impressive marriage ceremony of his church. 
The responses were solemnly
uttered, the benediction invoked, and at that midnight
hour, in the stillness of the porter's lodge, Emile
Le Grande and the young Jewess were pronounced
"man and wife." Driving quickly to the vessel that
was ready to depart for the tropical port with the first
appearance of the morning sun, Emile soon safely
ensconced his bride in the comfortable cabin, and with
a feeling of joy, tinged only with a shadowy apprehension, 
he bade adieu to the kind bishop, who had
accompanied them thither.</p>
            <p>As the morning sun rose, bright and ruddy, from
its eastern bed, the vessel's gun, giving the signal for
departing, sounded beyond the foaming bar, and the
newly wedded lovers were adrift, alike upon the ocean
of life and upon the blue expanse that surrounded
them—adrift to suffer a dismal shipwreck, or to anchor
safely within some remote harbor of love and security.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
            <p>ANXIOUS and nervous from the expected sorrow
of the coming day, Mr. Mordecai rose early from
his couch of restless slumber. Restlessly he walked
the library floor backward and forward, awaiting the
appearance of his daughter Leah. At length he said
to his wife, as she summoned him to the morning meal,
"It's very late. I wonder why Leah does not come
down. I'll just step to her room, and see if she is
ready; fatigue and anxiety may have caused her to
sleep later than usual this morning. I'll join you in
the breakfast-room in a moment."</p>
            <p>After a moment had elapsed, Mr. Mordecai stood
gently tapping at his daughter's chamber door. There
was no response. He gently opened it. The room
was vacant. Not a sound or a voice greeted his entrance. 
Stiff and well-arranged, the elegant furniture
stood mutely against the cold, cheerless walls. The
ominous tidiness of the deserted bed-chamber bespoke
a fearful story. The father stood for a moment in
amazement, silently surveying the apartment, his heart
half trembling with a vague fear; then he said, in a
hoarse, frightened tone, "Leah, my daughter, where
are you?" There came no reply, but the faint echo
of his whispered words, "Where are you?"</p>
            <p>Stepping forward softly into the room, he paused<pb n="128"/>
again, and then with slow, uncertain step approached
the casement that looked out upon the front garden.
There was nothing without but the sunshine and the
breeze, and the passing crowd already beginning to
throng the streets. Again he turned, with anxious
heart, away from the crowd without, to the deserted
room within. "Where's my daughter? Leah, dear
Leah, where are you?" A folded scrap of paper upon
the escritoire caught his eye, and springing forward he
seized it, half hopefully, half fearfully, and tremblingly
unfolded it. These are the words it contained:</p>
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>"OWN DEAREST FATHER: Can you, will you ever
forgive your disobedient Leah? I shudder when I
think of you, reading these lines in the morning, when
I shall be far away from your loving embrace! But,
dear father, you know I did not desire to go to Saxony, 
so far away from you; fearing, yes, even knowing
that circumstances would arise to prevent my return.
I cannot explain my meaning, dear father, for fear of
imperilling your happiness. I prefer to live on, as I
have done for years, with the secret of my sorrow—the
secret that impels me to this act of disobedience—hidden
in my heart. I fear your wrath, and yet, dear
father, I cannot go. I prefer to remain and marry the
one whom, next to yourself, I love above all mankind—Emile
Le Grande. Yes, dear father, when your eyes
peruse these lines, I shall be his wife, and far away on
my journey to our distant home. He loves me, and I
love him, yet more than once have I refused his love,
in deference to your teachings, that 'to deny my
people and my faith, by marriage with a Christian, was<pb n="129"/>
worse than death, and an everlasting disgrace.' Can I
hope, then, for your forgiveness, even though I seek it
on bended knees, dear father? Had I been allowed
to remain at home, I never should have married him,
certainly not in the clandestine manner I propose. I
flee to the love and protection of Emile, as an alternative 
to a dreadful fate. Oh! pity and forgive me,
father; love me, even though I bring sorrow to your
tender, loving heart. In my new home, I shall watch
and wait for some tidings, some missive like a white-winged
dove, bearing me a single word of love and remembrance 
from my beloved father. If it comes not,
alas! ah me! you may always know there's a sorrow
in my heart that no amount of happiness or prosperity can 
ever eradicate—a darkness that no sunshine can
ever dispel.</p>
                        <p>"And now again, and lastly, my father, I pray that
the blessing of the great God of Israel may ever rest
upon your venerable head; and will you not, too,
invoke His blessing to descend upon the head of your
unworthy and unhappy child? Dear, dear, precious
father, <emph>now adieu</emph>, a long tearful adieu, till I receive
your blessing.</p>
                        <closer>
                           <salute>"Sorrowfully, your own</salute>
                           <signed>"LEAH."</signed>
                        </closer>

            <p>Stupefied and amazed, Mr. Mordecai scarcely
realized the import of the words that his flashing eye
devoured, till the familiar signature was reached.
Then, as if a flood of light had burst upon his blinded
vision, came the dreadful revelation; involuntarily he
exclaimed, "Eternal God! It cannot be! It is not<pb n="130"/>
possible, that my child has fled from me! Gone with
a Christian dog, to become his wife; seduced by his
honeyed words from the embrace of my love to that of
his faithless heart! Torn from my home to follow the
wanderings of a villain! Oh, God!  Oh, heaven! It
cannot be! It must not be! I swear, by Israel, it <emph>shall</emph>
not be! Oh my child! my daughter, my own precious
Leah? Where art thou? Where hast thou fled, my
daughter?"</p>
            <p>In frenzy Mr. Mordecai smote his breast, tore his
silvery locks, and bowed in grief as the fatal letter fell
from his trembling hand. The depths of his sorrow
were stirred, and the tears that flowed from his burning heart 
left the fountain dry and shrivelled. Then,
as the calm succeeds the storm, so, when this fierce
tempest of emotion was passed, Mr. Mordecai regathered his strength, 
summoned the forces of his pride,
revenge, and hatred, dispelled all traces of his sorrow,
steeled himself for the duty before him, and with a
heart of stone in a bosom of adamant, took up the
letter and descended the stairs to the waiting family
below. Untasted before them was the morning meal.
With wild look and emphatic step Mr. Mordecai
entered the breakfast-room, and stood before the family
holding the letter aloft in his trembling hand. "See
here," said he, with a ringing voice, "read here the
story of a child, that sought to break an aged father's
heart. But hear me first. Hear this my oath. This
heart shall <emph>not</emph> break, I swear it shall not! Leah has
gone—fled with a Christian dog, to become his wife.
Read it for yourselves when I am gone; but hear me,
you that remain. Sarah and Frederick. My blessing<pb n="131"/>
shall never rest upon her, living or dying. As she
has chosen to bring sorrow upon the gray hairs of
her father, so may God rain trouble upon her disobedient head. 
May her children wander, uncircumcised
dogs, friendless, and neglected—as she has neglected me—upon
the face of the earth, ever seeking bread, yet
feeling constant hunger! Despised of her people, and
rejected of her people's God, may she ever feel the
need of a friend, and yet find none! Her disobedience
is cursed forever, so I swear it by the God of Israel!
Mark my words, and remember my wrath!" he concluded, 
looking fiercely into the eyes of the two children who sat 
silent before him. "Read this for yourselves; and then burn it, 
and scatter the ashes to the winds." No one made reply to that outburst of
implacable, burning rage, that so consumed the father's
heart. They had never seen him in such a frenzy
before. Mr. Mordecai then hurriedly left the house,
and passing Mingo, at the porter's lodge, went out
without a nod of recognition. Urbanely bowing and
smiling, Mingo let his master pass, wondering at this
singular breach of his accustomed politeness.</p>
            <p>As the lodge door closed after Mr. Mordecai had
passed out, Mingo bethought him of something, and
hastily pursuing his master, said:</p>
            <p>"Here, master, is this your yourn?"</p>
            <p>"What?" asked the master morosely.</p>
            <p>"This book, sir; I found it in the lodge."</p>
            <p>Mechanically, Mr. Mordecai took it from the servant, 
and placed it in the inner pocket of his coat, and
then passed on without a word. In the house, all
were startled, all dismayed, at the disclosure in the<pb n="132"/>
letter; all, save Rebecca, were filled with sadness. She
felt no regret. The brother and sister moved silently
and sorrowfully about the house, and in and out of the
vacated chamber, hardly realizing that their gentle
sister had indeed gone.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
            <p>MR. MORDECAI had scarcely passed a square
from his home, when suddenly he retraced his
steps, and stood again before the lodge.</p>
            <p>"Mingo," he said sharply, "tell your mistress to
send me that cursed letter. Be quick."</p>
            <p>With a dash the nimble slave obeyed the command,
and in a moment stood before his master, the letter in
his hand, bowing and smiling with his usual politeness.</p>
            <p>Taking the letter, Mr. Mordecai crushed it in his
hand, then placed it in his breast pocket, as he again
started forward toward his banking-house. If he
passed man, woman, child, friend, acquaintance, or
kinsman in that morning's walk, he knew it not; for
the tumult of passion that stirred his soul obliterated
for the time every recollection but that of the terrible
sorrow that had befallen him. In due time he reached
the dingy brown banking-house, and stood irresolutely
for a moment upon the well-worn stone steps. He
placed the ponderous key within the lock, but the
hand seemed powerless to turn its massive bolt; and
for a moment he stood with thoughtful, determined
eye resting upon the pavement. A moment more, and
then he quickly withdrew the key, dropped it into his
pocket, and briskly retraced his steps for square after
square, and then abruptly turned into the well-known<pb n="134"/>
street where stood the office of the distinguished Le
Grande.</p>
            <p>It happened that Mr. Mordecai approached the
office from one direction, as Judge Le Grande himself approached 
it from another, riding in the light
single phaeton in which he usually drove to and from
his office.</p>
            <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Mordecai. How goes it with
you, my friend, this fine morning?" said the judge
pleasantly, as he alighted and threw the lines to Cato,
the driver.—"Tell your mistress she need not send for
me till five o'clock. I shall be very busy to-day."
Then turning to the banker he looked for a reply.</p>
            <p>"It's no good-morning to me," replied the banker
fiercely. "The night has brought devilish work to
my home."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean, my friend?" was the judge's
quiet reply. "What has the night done?"</p>
            <p>"Played the devil! Don't you try to trifle with
my sorrow. That son of yours has already wrought
me injury enough. Don't you attempt to mock me.
I warn you, Le Grande, I warn you!"</p>
            <p>Astonished by these mysterious words of the Hebrew, 
Judge Le Grande gravely assured Mr. Mordecai that he knew
nothing of the trouble that had
befallen him, and repeatedly asked, "What has my
son done?"</p>
            <p>"Done? Alas! he has done that which would to
God I could undo!" was the reply, uttered angrily
and savagely. "But as I cannot undo it, I shall curse
it—curse it from the depths of my soul! He has
married my daughter? Stolen her—taken her away in<pb n="135"/>
secret from my house, and they have wisely fled from
my presence!"</p>
            <p>"Married your daughter!" ejaculated the judge,
the truth faintly dawning on him. "Surely that's a
mistake."</p>
            <p>"Indeed it is a wild mistake; I would to God it
were otherwise."</p>
            <p>"By what authority do you make this assertion?"
continued Judge Le Grande, evidently aroused by the
dawning truth.</p>
            <p>"By the confession of my daughter, left in her
room, and written a short time before her flight."</p>
            <p>"Where is that confession? Let me see it."</p>
            <p>"Here," replied the banker, drawing the crumpled
missive from his pocket. "There, read the mischief
for yourself."</p>
            <p>With trembling hand Judge Le Grande smoothed
out the crushed paper, and eagerly, fearfully, scanned
the contents that were to crush his hopes, as they
had crushed those of the banker. Silently, carefully,
he read it, read it till the story was told, and then,
brushing away a tear from his eye he said, with emotion:</p>
            <p>"Mordecai, forgive her! Forgive her, as I shall
forgive him; and now that it is done, let us make the
best of it."</p>
            <p>"Forgive!" hissed the banker; "forgive such an
act of disobedience as that? Such disgrace to my
name and people? Never, while there is a drop of
Hebrew blood in Benjamin Mordecai's veins, will I
forgive it!"</p>
            <p>"It's no more a disgrace to your name and people
than it is to mine; but I consider that people are fools,<pb n="136"/>
who make disgrace of family troubles, by obstinately
parading them before the world."</p>
            <p>"Then I shall delight in being a fool, if so you
deem it," replied Mr. Mordecai, with kindling emotion.</p>
            <p>"Alas! I had great plans for Emile," said Judge
Le Grande sadly, as he turned away from Mr. Mordecai; "and his 
mother too; she had fondly hoped he
would marry Belle Upton. Now, all is disappointment. I do not 
know how she will bear it. As for
myself, I shall make the best of it. I hope they may
be happy.—I say, Mordecai," looking steadily at the
banker, "they have my forgiveness and my blessing
too. You may do as you please."</p>
            <p>"Well, I curse them," the banker answered bitterly;
"and I swear they shall never see my face again, living or dying.
Not one dollar from my purse shall
they ever receive, even though want and beggary
come upon them. Think not I can ever change,
Judge Le Grande. As my people and my people's
God, the Eternal Father, are unchangeable, so is my
purpose concerning these disobedient children. Good
morning." Mr. Mordecai then turned slowly from the
office, and as the judge beheld the receding form, and
remembered the fierce flash of his dark eye, he unhesitatingly 
exclaimed, "Poor old man! I pity you. And,"
he added after a moment's pause, "Heaven pity us
both!"</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>As a bird floats safely upon the bosom of the blue
sky and finds at last her leafy home, so the little
vessel that bore the fugitive lovers, found safe and
speedy anchorage in the quiet harbor of the sea-girt<pb n="137"/>
isle that was to be their future home. The young,
ardent husband, and the fair, gentle wife, gazed
with delight upon the cloudless skies and bright
waters, and thought hopefully of the future. Only
one shadow darkened their horizon. It was a fearful
thought, to Leah, that her father's anathema might
ever rest upon her. But the future was veiled, and
the voice of Hope whispered, "his blessing may come
by and by. Wait."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
            <p>TWO years rolled away—two short, bright years
of individual and national prosperity, and then
came a change. To use the words of the immortal
Dickens, "It was the best of times, it was the worst
of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of
foolishness; it was the season of light, it was the season of 
darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the
winter of despair; we had everything before us, we
had nothing before us; we were all going direct to
heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
These utterances of inspiration so fittingly describing
the period that ushered in the bloody French Revolution, 
may be applied with equal truth and force to the
years that inaugurated the war between the States in
fair America.</p>
            <p>Did not prosperity bud and blossom in every vale
and hamlet of this fair domain? And yet were a people ever 
more unmindful of, or more ungrateful for
their blessings? Bickering and strife, dissension and
hatred, grew fiercer with the growth of the nation's
grandeur. Slavery, on one hand said, "I will," and
Freedom, on the other, "You shall not." So the war-cloud, 
"the size of a man's hand" only at first, appeared upon the 
dim horizon of the future. Wisdom
sought to devise plans for averting war, but Folly shook<pb n="139"/>
her locks tauntingly, and said mockingly, "Ha! ha!
War is pleasant pastime." So the culmination was
reached, and a misguided people, clamorous for war,
sounded the tocsin that caused rivers of blood to flow
from brothers' hearts, and enshrouded a grand and
happy people in desolation and disgrace.</p>
            <p>At the time when the war-cloud of fratricidal conflict 
was rolling dark and broad over the land, a treacherous enemy 
on the border were menacing and even
destroying many of our country's peaceful citizens.
Upon the broad frontier at the Far West it became the
duty of the government to hold these wily foes in
check by a strong and reliable armed force. To this
north-western outpost of service Captain Marshall had
been ordered by the voice of his country. Not ordered
there as to a holiday excursion, but ordered into actual
bloody conflict, and to an ordeal that would have tried
the bravery and courage of a veteran. At the head of
his command, Company A, 3d Regiment U. S. Regulars, Captain Marshall 
reached this post of danger in
the hour of its most imminent peril. But for this
timely arrival of troops, the peaceful little town of
Minneopoli might have been laid waste, and its defenceless inhabitants
cruelly butchered or carried away
captive. But the premeditated destruction of the
town was averted, the treacherous "red-skins" disappointed, and 
Captain Marshall's bravery demonstrated
beyond a peradventure.</p>
            <p>It was the night after the attack of the Indians,
and the bloody repulse. All was quiet. The troops
were reassembled in camp. The usual garrulity of
the soldiers was checked by the recollection of their<pb n="140"/>
dead comrades, so recently laid to rest in soldiers'
graves. All, too, remembered the danger through
which they had passed, and many were moody and
silent. At length a bright-faced, light-headed young
recruit spoke out, seeing the silence and sadness around
the camp-fire. "I say, captain, that was a wretched
red-skin of a chief that you hauled in yesterday. He
looked more like the Prince of Darkness than the chief
of a tribe. I thought once, cap'n, he had you; and
I was just ready to pick him off, when I saw you
were safe."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Carlos, that was a close place, and but for a
kind fate, I should be sleeping with those brave fellows who 
have left us. Peace to their resting-places."</p>
            <p>"I was sorry you did not kill him; he deserved
death. But how quick he did surrender, when he saw
you close in on him with your sword! Ha! ha!"</p>
            <p>"Yes, Mico is a bad, bad Indian, and has caused
more trouble to this settlement than all the other Indians
combined. I guess he will enjoy his freedom,
when he gets it again. Confinement and chains are
worse than death to him."</p>
            <p>"I tell you, cap'n, they are cowardly devils. They
can't stand gunpowder. At the very smell of it they
run out from their hiding-places, like so many rats
from a burning building. I hated to see one of them
taken alive. It's not like fighting civilized people; is
it, cap'n? I am in favor of the black flag in a fight
with these red devils."</p>
            <p>"War is war, Carlos, and brutalizes the most intelligent 
people on earth, if they indulge in it. I trust
our troubles are ended here, for a long time, if not<pb n="141"/>
forever, now that Mico is our prisoner. At any rate,
I hope all will remain peaceful and tranquil till I go
home and return. For a month I have a leave of absence, 
to visit my native State."</p>
            <p>"Going home, captain, to see your mother?" spoke
up a fair-haired young boy, scarcely eighteen, who had
sat a silent listener to the conversation between Carlos and his commander.</p>
            <p>"Ah! Franco, I have no mother; she died long
ago," replied the captain; "but I am going back to
my native State. My father and a brother and sister
live there."</p>
            <p>"It has been many a long day," said Franco,
"since I saw my native hills, and heard my mother's
gentle voice, as she went singing about our humble
home. I often wonder how she could sing so, with so
much poverty and care constantly about her. Maybe I
shall never see her again ;" and a shade of sorrow crept
over the fair young face of the French recruit.</p>
            <p>The captain replied, "I trust that you may, Franco,
though you are now so many leagues away. What
brought you away from her, Franco?"</p>
            <p>"Poverty, captain, poverty; and unless I can
lighten the burden of my mother's life by returning,
I shall never go back!"</p>
            <p>Silence at length settled upon the camp, and one by
one the groups of comrades disbanded. The campfires
were extinguished, and at an early hour sleep
tenderly enfolded these guardians of their country's
peace and security.</p>

            <p>THE spring had come again, and a little more than
its first month had elapsed when, early one morning, as the sun 
was stealing up softly from the east,
and before it had brought the hour for the slumbering
troops to be aroused by another réveille, or had gilded
the hills and valleys with its light, Captain Marshall,
accompanied by his faithful orderly, Franco, entered
the half-slumbering town of Minneopoli and turned
toward the inn, whence the coach was soon to leave
for the nearest railway station.</p>
            <p>"Lieutenant Styles will be in command, Franco,
till I return, you know, and I fear he will form a dangerous 
substitute, with his affable nature," said the
captain, as the hour of parting drew near.</p>
            <p>"Well, never mind that, captain; no matter how
affable, we boys do not wish a new commander just
now," returned the true-hearted boy.</p>
            <p>"Take care of your scalps, Franco. Don't let the
'red-skins' surprise you while I am gone. There, I
see the coach is ready. I must soon bid you adieu."</p>
            <p>"If I remember the bravery of my captain, the
red devils won't get my scalp, I'll wager. But I hope
they are settled for a time. Come back as soon as you
can, captain, and in your absence think occasionally of
Franco, will you? There comes the coach. The
horses are fine and gay."</p>
            <pb n="143"/>
            <p>"Rest assured, Franco, I will think of you, and
often too. How I would like to take you with me!
But take care of yourself. A month's absence is not
such a long time, after all. Good-by, my dear fellow,
good-by;" and seating himself in the waiting coach,
Captain Marshall waved an adieu to his sorrowful
young companion, and at the same moment the coach
driver hallooed, "All ready!" and gave a sharp crack
of the whip; the horses dashed forward, and recruit
and captain were soon separated—separated forever.
In less time than a fortnight, Captain Marshall had 
accomplished his long and troublesome journey, and
was safe once more within his native State.</p>
            <p>"I tell you, Fred," said the captain, one day when
he was visiting a friend in the Queen City, "the
agitated, portentous state of affairs in this section distresses 
and alarms me. I had no dream of the warlike
aspect of this quiet Queen City of the Sea. I fancied
we had all the trouble with us, in the north-west,
among those wretched savages. I came home for a
month of recreation and pleasure, and—" he uttered
with slight hesitation—"for the fulfilment of my
plighted troth; for the realization of the bright dream
of a love that has brightened my heart for nearly two
years. Yes, Fred, and if it were not for the business
that takes me to fair Melrose, I should regret that my
coming home had been just at this time. I tell
you, my good fellow, the future portends evil, if
not bloodshed."</p>
            <p>"Well, Marshall, bloodshed is inevitable, unless as
a section we are allowed our constitutional rights; and<pb n="144"/>
I, for one, say, if it must, let it come, even with the fury
of a storm. I am for State rights, and the Palmetto
State forever!"</p>
            <p>"Not bloodshed, Fred, if we can avert it," replied
the young officer to the enthusiastic outburst of the
impetuous young Pinckney, the beloved friend of
his boyhood. "I am just from the gory field, where I
saw my brave men fall beneath the treacherous blows
of the Indians. I have seen bloodshed, and desire to
see no more of it. I have always loved military life,
you know, Fred; but I tell you it tries the heart of a
man to see his men shot down like dogs."</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes; you are for the Union, I see," replied
young Pinckney with impatient gesture. "Your
service in the regular army has weaned your heart
from your native State, I fear."</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes; I am for the Union just now—the
union of hearts, at least; and as you go with me to
Melrose, you shall see that the union is maintained."</p>
            <p>"O bother! Marshall; you can think of nothing
now but matrimony. I am for the union of hearts myself; but the 
union of States as it has existed, I detest.
Peaceable secession, you see, we cannot have; and if
it must come in bloodshed, why, in the name of
mankind, let it come! I am ready for the issue of
my State's action."</p>
            <p>"I pray your blood may never be required as
the price of forcible secession, my dear Fred. But
the condition of the country appals me! I—whom
duty calls to one place, and whom ties of affection bind
to another—I am placed in no enviable position. Yet<pb n="145"/>
I still hope the trouble will soon clear up, and all will
yet be bright."</p>
            <p>"Your duty is plain before you, Marshall. It's
<emph>for or against us now</emph>, and no equivocation."</p>
            <p>"Well, we'll not fall out about our country's troubles. They 
may be better and they may be worse than
we anticipate. I'll hope for the best, though evil
come. Let's talk of Melrose, and the fair flower
that blooms there. Eh, Fred?"</p>
            <p>Fred replied smiling, "So we will, dear boy; here,
take this cigar. Let's have a smoke, and if you like
we'll stroll down to the Battery and see the encampment."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
            <p>THE rosy month of May succeeded the chilly April
in that memorable year when the war-cloud
of civil contest overshadowed the land so darkly. It
came with unwonted verdure, freshness, and beauty,
filling the hearts of the despondent with hope, and the
hopeful with rejoicing. It was scarcely a month from
the time the coach dashed out of the half-aroused town
of Minneopoli in the chilly April morning, when a
similar vehicle, one evening, toiled slowly up the long
hill whose summit was crowned by picturesque Melrose.
Among the passengers were Captain Marshall and his
friend Fred Pinckney. The former had come to Melrose to claim 
the hand of his affianced, Eliza Heartwell,
and to take her away as his wife. In that sweet May-time,
no heart was happier than George Marshall's, and
no voice gladder, as it rang out in unrestrained laughter
at the droll jokes and facetious comments of his witty
friend Fred.</p>
            <p>"I say, George, this is undoubtedly the beautifulest
country I ever saw. Do see. Such honeysuckles and
such dog-wood blossoms never grew before. Maybe
if the fates are propitious, I'll come back here to this
picturesque country to get me a wife, after the war is
over. Who knows? Then I'll be a laurel-crowned hero,
having whaled out the Yankees to a frizzle, and all the<pb n="147"/>
fair ones will be sighing for my hand and heart!
Umph! I am impatient for the conflict. <emph>George, you
know the Yankees won't fight!"</emph>
            </p>
            <p>"Well, we will see. At any rate, from my acquaintance with them, 
I shall not go to battle against them
armed only with a broom-stick. But here we are in
Melrose. Don't, for love's sake, talk of war. My
heart's in a flutter. Cupid's conflict is worse than the
Indians, Fred."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I see you have surrended unconditionally;
yet your captivity is by no means galling, I observe.
Well, you are a lucky fellow, George. Prosperity
attend you."</p>
            <p>Fatigued from the long journey, so much of
it accomplished by tiresome, lumbering stage-coaches,
these two travelling companions gladly alighted at
the Melrose Tavern, and eagerly sought the refreshments 
its simple hospitality afforded.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
            <p>IN the quiet little parlor of Widow Heartwell, in
the early May morning, the tender breeze stole in
and out of the window, fluttering the muslin curtain
and filling the apartment with delicious perfume. In
the same parlor a few chosen friends were assembled,
to witness the solemn ceremony that was to deprive
them of the pride and favorite of the village. As the
dial upon the delicate face of the little bronze clock
on the mantel marked the hour of eight, the flutter
of robes and the rustling of footsteps ushered in the
expectant pair, and at once all the guests arose.</p>
            <p>Pale and trembling, Mrs. Heartwell took her place
beside her daughter, as she stood before the venerable
minister. For years the Rev. Mr. Pratt had been their
pastor and spiritual adviser, and his heart was filled
with deep emotion as he pronounced the solemn words
that bound this child of his love and watchful care to
her husband, to be
<quote>
                  <l part="N">"His servitor for aye."</l>
               </quote>
Amid smothered sobs, he invoked Heaven's benediction upon 
their wedded hearts, praying that, as love
had directed this union, so love might attend them,
even unto death.</p>
            <p>Amid sighs and tears, the congratulations were<pb n="149"/>
received, and when at length Fred Pinckney found a
moment to whisper in George Marshall's ear, he said,
with characteristic drollery, "By Jupiter? I'll be
glad when the coach comes. I can't stand so much
crying; it's more like a funeral than a wedding. If
they are obliged to blubber this way when a fellow
marries, I think I shall back out."</p>
            <p>Another hour and the bridal party had departed.
The fair flower of Melrose was gone, changed from a
lonely maiden to a happy, hopeful bride; gone to
follow the footsteps of a true, brave-hearted husband,—gone
from Melrose, leaving many aching hearts
behind; leaving, too, a vacancy that no succession of
years could ever quite fill.</p>
            <p>A fortnight after the quiet wedding in Melrose,
late one afternoon, George Marshall and his wife were
walking slowly along the ever-thronged battery of the
Queen City, whither they had come on a visit to Captain Marshall's 
uncle, Dr. Thornwell. A serious expression rested upon the 
young captain's face, as he
surveyed the long lines of tents that dotted the open
square and bordered the broad street—so serious indeed, that 
he scarcely heeded the passers-by who were
bowing salutations to him and his fair bride.</p>
            <p>"George, you seem so abstracted; you scarcely
noticed Frank Brewster as he passed just now in the
brett with Florence Dale. What's the matter, dear?"</p>
            <p>"I'm troubled, perplexed, pondering, my dear.
Yet I did not mean to be so abstracted. I must beg
your forgiveness, as well as that of my friends."</p>
            <p>"Oh! never mind me, George; only tell me what
troubles you."</p>
            <pb n="150"/>
            <p>"Nothing more than the perplexing question that
has harassed me ever since I came home, and saw
beyond a doubt that we should have war—the question
that I must soon decide, whether I shall desert my
State in time of peril, or my country. In either course
of acting, I shall be branded as a traitor, or a rebel.
It's a serious dilemma to be placed in, dear Eliza, and
I must act wisely, and like a man. My heart is dreadfully divided: 
duty calls me to my country, and love
calls me to my home. My forebodings, too, whisper
that this war will be no trifling affair."</p>
            <p>"Well, for my part, George, and you already know
it, I am opposed to secession. Fred Pinckney says it's
on account of the Whig blood that flows in my veins.
I told him that my father, and my grandfather before
him, were uncompromising Whigs. It may be so; I
don't know. I abhor the idea of bloodshed, and as yet,
I think we have had little cause to declare war."</p>
            <p>"You are a sage little woman, and your argument
sound, but these sentiments won't do to promulgate in
the Queen City. Remember, I am still a commissioned
officer in the United States army. Be careful."</p>
            <p>"Oh! I am not afraid of my sentiments, or of being
deemed traitorous. Only this morning, Colonel Legare asked 
me if I would present the Palmetto Rifles
with the new flag he had made for them. But to
return. War is war, George, and should be entered
into with caution."</p>
            <p>"Yes; you are right. I feel at times as though I
could not fight against the flag of my country; and
then, on the other hand, I would not fight against my
home and kindred. There seems but one alternative<pb n="151"/>
left to me—to resign my commission in the army and
not take up arms at all," replied the young officer
sadly.</p>
            <p>"Well, cheer up. Don't grow despondent. I hope
wisdom will direct your decision; and remember, if
the thought will give you any comfort, that I have
sworn to follow your footsteps and your fortune,
wheresoever they may lead, be it from craggy Maine
to wild Colorado," said the young wife with forced
pleasantry.</p>
            <p>"Bravo! what a lucky fellow I am! Surely no
evil will befall me. Your cheering words decide my
choice; wisdom, you say, will direct the decision. It
shall be made. We will once more make the charming
round of this inviting boulevard, and then I'll tell
you my decision. There goes Fred Pinckney on horseback. 
How handsome he looks in that uniform! He
belongs to the Palmetto Rifles, I believe."</p>
            <p>"Yes, so he does. Fred's a gallant, handsome fellow, a 
little too hot-blooded, though," replied the
young wife, thoughtfully.</p>
            <p>Once again the gay promenade was traversed, and
as the sun's last ray was faintly dying, the young wife
stopped, and leaning gently on the railing with eye
turned toward the sea, she said, "Now, George, tell me
your decision." And he replied quickly, "I shall
resign my commission in the army, and cast my lot
with my people and my State. Alas! I may never
see Franco again!"</p>
            <p>"I trust you have acted wisely," replied the young
wife, thoughtfully. "But, oh, George, see Defiance.
See how the dying sun gilds the flag, the new flag that<pb n="152"/>
has risen above the old one that floated there when I
was here a school-girl. Somehow I love the old flag,
the Stars and Stripes—'Whig blood,' I suppose; but
Defiance always looked so grim and terrible to me,
even when I was a school-girl, in peaceful days, and
now it appears a terrible monster of horror!"</p>
            <p>"Oh! Defiance bears you no ill-will, my darling.
It's a quiet old fort, that will protect us from our enemies. 
Long live the memory of the man who surrendered it only at the mouth of cannon! 
But come, let's be going. It's late; already pedestrians and
vehicles are turning homeward."</p>
            <p>How sad, that time so far has furnished no historian or biographer 
truthfully and charitably to chronicle
the terrible struggle of many noble-souled men, who
sacrificed the love of country for the love of State in
that unhallowed civil war! Yet there is the truth
that the great Searcher of human hearts has His record
on high; and in the unfolding hereafter, many souls
that here were branded as traitors, will there receive
the rewards of patriots. Scores who were here despised for cowardice, 
will there receive the plaudits
that await the brave. Legions who have perished in
ignominious cells, will there be found crowned heroes.
For who knows the yet unwritten record of the horrible war between the 
States, but the heroes who perished
here and passed on beyond?</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
            <p>SIX months rolled by—six memorable months, that
sadly blasted a nation's hopes, and overturned the
plans and purposes of countless individuals. The war-cloud
had darkened and deepened, till the sky of many
a happy home was already obscured by its fearful
gloom. At the first bugle-note of conflict, a peaceful,
happy people was transformed, as if by magic, into a
warlike host. The war-tide rushed on with an impetuosity that 
bore all things before it. Willing or
unwilling, men <emph>must</emph> be soldiers. Cities, towns, and
villages were astir with excitement. Forgetting the
ordinary interests of life, people talked enthusiastically,
madly, of war. Months ago had the accustomed serenity of the 
Queen City given place to noisy military
life. Its by-ways and suburbs were dotted with tents,
the phantom homes of soldiers. Men who yesterday
were gentlemen, were to-day only vassals, whose existence was 
marked by the morning réveille and the
evening tattoo. The drilling, drilling, drilling, still
hourly went on; but not that peaceful exercise the
inhabitants had been wont to observe in Citadel Square
in days agone. Marching, guarding, countermarching,
watching, were the order of the day. Some hearts
were wild with enthusiasm, others dark with despair.
Already the tide of brothers' blood had crimsoned the<pb n="154"/>
sod of more than one State. Blood, blood, was flowing—crimson blood, 
that might have been a libation
to a nobler, holier cause.</p>
            <p>Old Defiance, standing dark and warlike in the harbor of the Queen City, 
had now a new commander.
The guns, as usual, turned their deadly mouths to the
open sea, but the gunners and the commander did not
wear the uniform of the old troops once garrisoned
there. George Marshall, impelled by the love of State,
and moved by the importunities of friends, had accepted
the position of commander at Defiance, and was now
Colonel instead of Captain Marshall. With regret,
with tears even, he folded away the regimentals of the
old army, and said with a sigh, as he laid them out of
sight, "I shall never need them again." Blame him,
if you dare, you who have never stood the test of
such a trial. Censure him for a traitor, if you must,
you that have only dallied on the outskirts of your
country's danger. In that book on high, thank God,
angels read his record aright.</p>
            <p>"George," said Eliza one morning to her husband,
in a soft October day, as he was about leaving her for
the fort, "I am sorry you ever took command of Defiance. 
I have always had a strange horror of that monster of the sea. 
I hate to think of your being there."</p>
            <p>"Well, you are foolish in that fear, my love. It's
much better for you than if I were in the field. If I
were at the head of a regiment, I should be ordered
here and there, Fate only knows where, and maybe
not see you for months, perhaps years. When you
become more acquainted with the old fortress, my
dear, you will cease to regard it with such terror."</p>
            <pb n="155"/>
            <p>"Maybe I shall, George, but I fear not. It stands
like some terrible apparition, ever before me, waking
or sleeping," she replied, half sadly, half fearfully.
"Oh! this terrible war! It has begun, but it is not
yet ended," she added with a shudder.</p>
            <p>"You must be more hopeful; your words are not
encouraging to a soldier-husband. Come, cheer up,
and go with me over to the fortress this evening.
What do you say? Go, and beard the lion in his den,
as it were."</p>
            <p>"I shall be most happy to do so, if it will tend to
dispel my prejudice, or rather, my dread of the place.
At what hour?"</p>
            <p>"At six P. M. precisely, the Sea-Foam leaves pier
number three for the fort. I'll return in time for us
to leave at that hour. Be ready. Adieu. I must
hasten!" He kissed her, and was gone.</p>
            <p>When Eliza was once again alone in her quiet
chamber, the skilful fingers were busy with her
work, and the perplexed brain was busy with its
thoughts. At length she said, half audibly, "I may
be foolish. God only knows how dreadfully I feel
about this wretched war."</p>
            <p>At the appointed time George Marshall returned,
to find his wife awaiting him; and without delay they
sought the Sea-Foam's pier. As the young colonel
walked beside his wife, so modestly yet becomingly
attired in simple white muslin, with a blue scarf round
her faultless figure, he thought her a paragon of
beauty, and passed on in silent admiration, till the pier
was reached.</p>
            <p>"What does this embarkation recall to your mind,<pb n="156"/>
George?" said the young wife pleasantly, as her husband seated 
himself beside her on the deck of the
Sea-Foam.</p>
            <p>"Nothing in particular, that I remember. What
is it?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, I was vain enough to suppose it might recall
to you an occasion that has ever been memorable to
me," she replied archly.  But I see you have forgotten that 
sunny June evening, five years ago, when I
embarked, from this very pier—embarked, leaving you
behind, and thinking I should never see you again."</p>
            <p>"Oh, forgive my want of memory and sentimentality. 
The war has well-nigh crushed the latter out
of my nature. I thank God though, that we have
now embarked together on the ocean of life, with no
fear of separation, and with the hope, too, that storms,
if they come, may not wreck our bark. Isn't the sea
lovely? And how delicious the breeze!"</p>
            <p>"Yes, the flags float airily; but the fort, though
seemingly so near, is yet quite far away. How deceptive is water!" 
The boat sped on toward the fortress
like a feather on the breeze.</p>
            <p>"Here we come," said the colonel, "nearer, nearer,
nearer, to the huge pile of sea-washed brick and mortar;
nearer to your dreaded enemy, my love; slower, slower,
slower, to the land. Here we are!" And the Sea-Foam
safely cast her anchor once again.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
            <p>EVENT crowded upon event as the first two long
years of the war glided by—years that seemed
to calendar twenty-four, instead of twelve months
each. The strife hadn't yet reached its climax, but
blood was flowing fearfully. From Maine to the Gulf
was one vast beleaguered sea-coast, for at every sea-port city, 
grim monsters of war stood guarding the
entrance to the harbor. Already the central, though
despised Queen City, was feeling the fire of a fierce
and cruel bombardment. Refugees were flitting
hither and thither about the country, seeking peace
and security, but finding none. Want and privation
were even now beginning to menace a once luxurious
people, and gloom and despair to enshroud the hopes
of those who had fondly dreamed of a successful dismemberment 
of the Union. Such was the record of the
years preceding the memorable seven days' fighting 
at "Merry Oaks."</p>
            <p>These battles form the half-way stone in the long 
period of our civil war. It was the day after the
dreadful conflict. The forces had retired to re-gather
their strength, and the wounded, dying, and dead, 
were left upon the field. Early in the morning, as
the heat of the summer sun was streaming down, a
horseman rode slowly and carefully about this field of <pb n="158"/>
death. Here and there, lying thickly, as they fell, were
the dead of both forces, easily distinguished by the
different colors they wore, while gathered in groups,
under the grateful shade-trees, could be seen the
wounded whose strength was sufficient to drag them
thither. This field was a shocking spectacle. And as
the horseman rode slowly along the desolate track,
peering curiously and sadly into the upturned faces of
the dead, a casual observer might have detected the
melancholy expression on his face, and marked the
glittering tear that bedewed his eyes. For brave,
true, noble George Marshall, was never ashamed to
weep over the woes of humanity! Imperative business had 
called him from his post of duty to the seat
of war, just in time to be within ear-shot of that memorable seven 
days' carnage. And as he rode, on that
quiet summer morning, strange, painful emotions filled
his heart. Around and about him, before and behind,
lay grim and ghastly faces cold in death—faces of soldiers 
who were brothers in country, and many of them
brothers in name—brothers in actual consanguinity,
brothers in destiny, brothers in everything, save <emph>love</emph>.
There they were, peaceful now, side by side, the last
conflict ended, the last spark of animosity extinguished;
there, side by side—dead. No wonder George Marshall wept. 
The wonder is that there ever throbbed
a human heart that could refrain from weeping over
such a scene.</p>
            <p>At length, George Marshall suddenly drew his rein,
and lifting his hand to his forehead so as to shade his
eyes, gazed curiously forward for a moment toward an
object lying not very far distant. Then, quickly<pb n="159"/>
alighting, he stepped cautiously toward the object of
his scrutiny. It was the dead body of a soldier.
The dark blue uniform told to which army he belonged.
The stocking, turned back from a slender ankle, fell
carelessly over the heavy army shoe. The head was
half-averted, and the open eyes, though sightless, were
still bright with God's own azure.</p>
            <p>"Creeping gently through his slender hand, as
though it loved the cold caress of death, was a wild
vine whose tiny blossoms would have shrunk at the
touch of a wild bee's foot." By the side of his face was
the worn cap that had fallen from his head as he fell.</p>
            <p>Fearfully, timidly, with an air of dread, Colonel
Marshall approached the silent figure and bent over
the recumbent form.</p>
            <p>"Great God! it <emph>is</emph> Franco! I thought I knew the
poor fellow from afar! Poor, poor boy! Poor fair-haired
Franco!" he exclaimed in a breath. Then gently
turning the soiled cap, he read "Third Regiment
United States Regulars." "My old command, my old
command," he murmured. "Alas! poor Franco! I
thank God we did not meet in deadly conflict. Your
true, kind heart wished no one ill, yet an unkind fate
has brought you to a mournful end, and I, for one,
shall mourn your hapless lot. Alas! poor boy, you'll
never see your vine-clad France again, and your kind
mother's peasant home will ever be darkened by your
absence."</p>
            <p>Then kneeling for a little time beside the dead
boy, the kind-hearted colonel dropped a tear and
bowed his head in deep reflection. Then, arising and
looking eagerly about him, he said at length, "There,<pb n="160"/>
in the end of that entrenchment, by the side of that
shattered tree, I can lay his body, in lieu of a better
grave. There it will at least be safe from the vultures
and the horrible fate that awaits the unburied dead of
a defeated army."</p>
            <p>Then tenderly and sadly he laid the young soldier
away in his peaceful grave, covering his face with his
smoke-stained cap, and folding his pulseless hands
upon his bosom. At last, covering the mound upon
which his tears had fallen, with some evergreen
boughs, he patiently carved upon a rude board, that

            <p>THE bombardment of the Queen City continued.
With unprecedented stubbornness did she resist the
enemy's fierce demands, and stand firm amid the death-dealing
blows of shot and shell. Many of the inhabitants 
had fled from their homes at the first boom of
the shelling guns, but many, too, had remained; and
among the latter number was Mr. Mordecai's family.
But now the moment had arrived when farther exposure to 
danger seemed to the banker a reckless disregard of life. 
So they were going—going, as many
others had gone, leaving behind the palatial home, with
its comforts and luxuries, for the privations, hardships,
discomforts, of a refugee life. Articles of value were
being removed to places of greater security, some to be
sold, others given to remaining friends, who could not
get away, and some left uncared for. It was the day
before the proposed departure. The house wore the
aspect of a dismantled castle. In the room formerly
the library, but now well filled with trunks, boxes,
bundles, and so on, Rebecca and her faithful attendant
were busy with the packing, unpacking, and repacking
of their household goods. "Here, Barbara," said
Rebecca, turning to the woman nearest her, as she
pushed aside an old worn portmanteau, "you can take
this. It's an old valise that my husband sent up from<pb n="162"/>
the bank the other day, among his rubbish from there.
Here, give me the papers out of it, and I'll lookover
them, while I sit here to rest a moment. Here, pour
them into my apron." Obeying this command, Barbara emptied 
the contents into the large apron that
the mistress upheld to receive them, and she sat down
to the examination. One by one the papers fell from
her fingers to the floor as valueless trash, and she pushed
them with her foot toward the open fire-place. Suddenly she 
descried upon the floor a dark brown paper,
loosely folded, that had fallen from her lap unobserved.
picking it up, she drew from it a small book, bound
in Russia leather, the size of a man's hand. Upon the
outer cover, in dim, well-worn, and mold-covered letters
was the word "Journal." "What can this be?" she
murmured curiously, holding it tightly in her hand.
Slowly unfastening the slender clasp, she read with
astonishment the words written upon the first page:
"Emile Le Grande's Diary."</p>
            <p>Amazed at what her eyes beheld, Rebecca hastily
secreted the book in her dress pocket and retired from
the room. Once securely out of sight, she eagerly began her 
scrutiny of the ill-fated little book that had
fallen so mysteriously into her possession. Record
after record was read with greedy eye. Soon her eye
rested upon the name, "Leah Mordecai." No vulture
ever devoured its unfortunate prey with more rapacity
that did this wicked woman the contents that followed,
day after day. Her eye gleamed with delight, and her
jewelled hands trembled for joy, as she turned leaf
after leaf of the unfortunate book. At length she
stopped suddenly, and exclaimed half-wildly, "Aha!<pb n="163"/>
I know it now! At last the truth has come to light,
the terrible mystery is revealed," as she read the unfortunate 
yet idle record of young Le Grande's, made
on the night of Bertha Levy's tea-party, the foolish
record: "If I knew that she loved Mark Abrams, I
would kill him."</p>
            <p>"You are mistaken, my bird," Rebecca continued
to soliloquize; "he did not love Leah Mordecai as fondly
as you supposed, but you dared to kill him from jealous
hatred when you well knew you were destroying the
hopes and future of my child. Well, I'll see to it that
revenge comes. My young eagle, you are not so far
away, but justice can find you. Though the water of
a dozen oceans rolled between us, I think my revenge
could reach you. Rest on in your fancied security
while you may, young villain; the storm is gathering
for your destruction. Rest on. Rebecca Mordecai will
<emph>never, never</emph> forget you. I will keep this secret 
to myself till my plans are matured; then I will act. Now, we
must fly, and then—well, never mind what then, so I
keep this treasure safe in my grasp." So saying, she
stowed the journal away in her bosom, and with a cruel
laugh, busied herself again with her preparations for
departure. The removal was made. The mansion of
the banker was vacated, and the Queen City left to the
mercy of the spoiler. In all these days of agitation
and confusion, the little journal lay safe in the bosom
of its possessor. She intended to have the way clear,
before unfolding her secret and her purpose. And
so it was.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
            <p>IN their quiet little sea-girt home, where the skies
were bright and blue, and the breezes balmy and
soft, Emile Le Grande and his young wife had dwelt
in peace and happiness for nearly five years. Not a
line had ever come, amid all Leah's hopeless longing
and vain expectation, to assure her of her father's
forgiveness and continued love. So, weary from this
continued disappointment, she had settled down into
the confident assurance, that his blessing now would
never come, and she must find happiness alone in her
husband's love. Long, long ago, Emile's parents had
written, expressing kindest wishes for their welfare,
and tendering to Leah a daughter's welcome. Mrs.
Le Grande, although disappointed and chagrined
that Belle Upton was not the choice of her son's love,
soon quieted down, and accepted the alternative with
astonishing and commendable resignation. So, despite
Leah's bitter disappointment, she was happy; for,
aside from Emile's love, she soon drew hope and
happiness from the life of the dark-eyed little daughter 
that had come to bless her home. Emile had
yielded to Leah's wishes, and, following the custom of
her people, she had called her little daughter, Sarah,
in memory of her mother, whose death she had so
long and deeply mourned.</p>
            <pb n="165"/>
            <p>The event of this little grandchild's birth had
never reached Mr. Mordecai's ears, for he had regarded
Leah as dead, ever since that dreadful morning when
he discovered that she had clandestinely married a
"Christian dog." He desired to know naught of her
welfare; he avoided knowing anything.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>In the interior of the State, about two hundred miles
distant from the Queen City, was a cosy, sequestered
little settlement, called Inglewood. To this little shelter of 
peace and security, many refugees had found
their way, and taken temporary homes. Many Hebrew
families from the Queen City had fled thither, and
among them those of Rabbi Abrams and Mr. Mordecai.</p>
            <p>It was some weeks after Mr. Mordecai's removal to
Inglewood, when one day Rebecca requested her
husband to accompany her to the house of the rabbi.
Mr. Mordecai gladly assented. They found the rabbi,
as usual, engrossed with his books in the temporary
library that was a necessary feature of his home. Mrs.
Abrams still bore on her pale, calm face the marks
of sorrow that had rested there since the terrible and
mysterious death of her son. Without delay, and by
dint of that skilful management which was characteristic of 
Rebecca, she approached the dreadful subject
of Mark's death. Then, after a pause, looking straight
at the rabbi, she said suddenly, with terrible emphasis,
"I know the guilty man—the one who did the dreadful deed." 
The rabbi, his wife, and Mr. Mordecai
looked aghast.</p>
            <p>"What do you mean," at length spoke out the
rabbi, in fearful bewilderment.</p>
            <pb n="166"/>
            <p>"I mean that I know who assassinated Mark," she
replied, with flashing eye and ringing voice.</p>
            <p>"Know who killed my son!" he ejaculated hoarsely,
"for Heaven's sake, who was it?"</p>
            <p>"You know the dark villain, Rebecca, who did
that bloody deed! By Israel, who was it?" said her
husband, almost in the same breath.</p>
            <p>"It was Emile—Le—Grande!" she replied slowly.
"He and none other."</p>
            <p>"That's a dreadful accusation," said the rabbi; "by
what authority do you make such a statement?"</p>
            <p>"By the authority of his own words," she replied
triumphantly. "Here, you can read the confession
for yourself." She drew forth the little journal and
pointed to the records.</p>
            <p>"There, read first: 'If I thought Mark Abrams
loved her, I would kill him."</p>
            <p>"Great God!" gasped the rabbi, looking again
at the record as though he thought his eyes had deceived him.</p>
            <p>"Here again, see here," said Rebecca, pointing to
one other record: "'Dead men tell no tales.' Was
that not some deed of his foul doing that he did not
wish discovered?" she continued, as she turned onward
through the book.</p>
            <p>"He shall die!" exclaimed Mr. Mordecai, quivering
with rage and astonishment, while the stricken father
turned and walked sadly across the floor, exclaiming,
"Ah me! ah me! Alas! my poor boy?" while the
mother's wounded heart bled afresh.</p>
            <p>"See here again," said Rebecca, pointing with her
finger to another record that bore upon the mystery.</p>
            <pb n="167"/>
            <p>"Enough! enough!" exclaimed the father, averting his head 
and waving her to silence with his hand.
"I have seen enough; the mystery is plain, the truth
at last revealed. O God, the dreadful truth!"</p>
            <p>Mr. Mordecai stamped his foot, clenched his hands,
and muttering half audibly, "This villain has ruined
you, has broken my heart, and destroyed the hopes of
my child; and he shall die!"</p>
            <p>"But, poor Leah, my husband," said Rebecca,
half timidly, and with a semblance of deep feeling.</p>
            <p>"Leah!" he angrily repeated, "dare you even, 
now, speak that name to me? Would to God she
were dead! Never insult me again with the utterance
of that name?"</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, dear husband; in the excitement
of this sad discovery I forgot your commands. I'll
obey you in future." And turning again to the subject, 
in order to appease her husband's displeasure, she
added, "By what means can you hope to reach Emile
now, dear husband? You know he's far away, and
the guns of a blockading fleet intervene."</p>
            <p>"Though the guns of a dozen fleets intervened, I
should bring him to justice," he replied sharply.</p>
            <p>"Think what my dear Sarah has suffered—is suffering still, 
from the work of his bloody hand, dear
husband," said Rebecca, affecting to weep, as she
covered her face with her hand.</p>
            <p>Well-nigh aroused to frenzy, Mr. Mordecai said
fiercely, "Promise me, Rabbi Abrams, promise me,
Rebecca, that you will lend me your aid in bringing
this fugitive to justice; and I swear by Jerusalem, he
shall be punished. I have gold, and that will insure<pb n="168"/>
me success. Yes, I have gold he coveted, but—aha!
that he has never received. Pledge me, promise me,
both of you, that good allies you will be!" And they
pledged him.</p>
            <p>"But, tell me, Rebecca," said the rabbi, suddenly
stopping in his agitated walk. "How did you come
into possession of that book?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed, Rabbi Abrams, that is a mystery. In
packing and unpacking, preparatory to leaving the
Queen City, I accidentally found this Journal in an old
portmanteau that my husband sent up from his bank
one day, among a lot of rubbish. It had lain there a
long time, I judge. Can you clear up the mystery,
my husband?" she said, turning to Mr. Mordecai.</p>
            <p>"Let me see it," he replied; and taking the Journal 
from her hands, he held it in his grasp as though
it were a deadly thing, while he eyed it strangely
from side to side.</p>
            <p>"I think, I think," he said slowly, as though abstracted 
and confused; "I think this is the book Mingo
gave me the morning after—" Then he was silent.
"Well, he found it in the lodge, I guess," he continued.
"I remember his giving me a small book <emph>that</emph> morning, 
and I laid it away somewhere, to look at when my
mind was less agitated. I had forgotten it."</p>
            <p>"A kind fate has preserved it, husband, so that
we might be avenged," said Rebecca.</p>
            <p>"Keep it securely then, as it will be needed in the
future. You are a wise, good woman, a wise little
wife," added the husband, with all trace of displeasure
toward her banished from his face.</p>
            <pb n="169"/>
            <p>Her mission accomplished, Rebecca, leaving the
distressed family to find solace for their sorrow as
best they could, returned home to gloat on the perfection 
of a scheme that would bring sorrow and desolation to the happy Cuban home.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
            <p>THE war still raged. The whole world, one might
dare to say, was more or less agitated by this
conflict. Vigilance, tightening its grasp here, redoubling its 
blows there, watching the inlets and outlets
everywhere, had taught a once happy people that war
was no holiday sport. But the great end must be
reached, the end of the "War of the Rebellion" with
the government intact. To accomplish this, every
means was deemed fair and honorable. Blockading,
starvation, destruction of property, the torch—yea, any
and every appliance that would tend to subdue a
hostile people, was brought into requisition to maintain the Union.</p>
            <p>So, before the third year of the memorable civil
war had run its bloody course, want almost stalked
abroad in this fair Southern land. But for the successful, 
though occasional ventures of some friendly
vessel, that succeeded in running the blockade, bringing 
stores necessary for the comfort of a war-worn people, 
dire want might have reigned supreme in many a
household, where wealth and luxury once dwelt. So
much for the good accomplished by those bold adventurers of the sea. 
And yet there were blockade-runners—a few, a very few, thank Heaven—who were but
a set of human vultures, preying upon their <orig>fellow-</orig>
               <pb n="171"/>
beings, and who, for a sum of gold, would lend their
hand to any deed of darkness. To this latter class belonged 
Joe Haralson, the well-known captain of the
Tigress, the most successful blockade-runner on all
the southern coast. Haralson himself was a native of
one of the fertile cotton islands off the coast of the
Palmetto State, and, in an hour of danger, had deserted
his country, and fled to the West Indies. There he
equipped a vessel for blockade-running, and being
familiar with much of the southern coast, he was
always successful in eluding the guns of the blockading fleets, 
and entering safely with his cargo. The
supplies of merchandise, and the munitions of war
that he occasionally landed, were exchanged for cotton, 
which he sold for gold at a fabulous profit.</p>
            <p>It was the summer after the removal of Mr. Mordecai's family 
to Inglewood. In the month of June,
Joe Haralson anchored the Tigress safely within the
port of Havana. New Providence was his usual
harbor of refuge; but now, other business than the
successful disposal of his cargo of cotton had brought
him thither. One soft, sweet morning, in this land
where spring and summer alternate, Leah had been
out driving with her husband, enjoying the early
morning breeze, and hoping that it would benefit the
delicate little Sarah, then in her second summer.
They drew near the Plaza de la Mar, and Emile
remarked, as he surveyed the endless rows of shipping:</p>
            <p>"There, Leah, see the countless numbers of flags."</p>
            <p>"Yes, all but the flag of our struggling country,"
she replied. "I wonder if that will ever become a
recognized flag among nations?"</p>
            <pb n="172"/>
            <p>"I fear not," Emile replied gravely. "But there!
our darling has fallen asleep! We must hasten home."</p>
            <p>On reaching home, Emile kissed his wife, and
softly kissed his sleeping baby too, before alighting from
the light volante; and then, throwing the lines to Petro,
the slave, who was awaiting their return, he said,
"Take care of the pony, Petro;" and turning to his
wife—"You take care of my wee lamb, Leah, till I
come again," and left them.</p>
            <p>An hour later, and a thick-set, rough-visaged man
entered the banking-house of Gardner &amp; Company,
and asked, in faltering English, "Is Señor Le
Grande in?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Gardner. "Here, Mr. Le
Grande, this man wants to see you." Emile approached, 
and looking curiously at the stranger,
observed that he was clad partly in sailor's, partly
in citizen's clothes. "What will you have, sir?"
demanded Emile.</p>
            <p>"Señor," replied the strange man, whose broken
English betrayed his Spanish tongue, "Dere is at da 
w'arf Blanco Plaza, a 'Merican vessel from da States.
A seik frien' wish to see señor Le Grande, very quick,
<emph>very quick</emph>, señor."</p>
            <p>"From what State does the vessel come?" asked
Emile in astonishment.</p>
            <p>"From da Soutern State, señor, da Pa'metto State."</p>
            <p>In a moment Emile conjectured that it was some
blockade-runner, and supposed some friend or relative
had arrived, and, being unable to come on shore, had
indeed sent for him. Without waiting to consider,
and without further explanation, he accompanied the<pb n="173"/>
strange guide, who led the way to the wharf. The flags
were floating free and gay, yet as this nameless cicerone 
pointed out the Tigress, that lay before them
with flag staff bare, Emile Le Grande thought, "The
captain is afraid to show his colors; well he may be."</p>
            <p>"Captain Haralson, Señor Le Grande," said the
guide, in broken accents, as he entered the ship's cabin,
where the captain awaited his return. "I told cap'n
you I would bring him," he continued, with a savage
grin upon his features.</p>
            <p>"Who is it would see me?" demanded Emile.
"Where is my sick friend?"</p>
            <p>"You are a prisoner, sir," replied the captain
fiercely, "a fugitive from justice, and your State calls
for your return."</p>
            <p>"By what authority do you utter those words, you
scoundrel?" replied Emile, in bewildered indignation.</p>
            <p>"By the authority of those you have injured, and
who have sent me to bring you back."</p>
            <p>"Who, and where are my accusers?" asked Emile
angrily. "Let them dare confront me!"</p>
            <p>"Then follow me," said the captain, as he passed
along to a small apartment, a kind of saloon, at the end
of the vessel. He gave three sharp, quick raps at the
door, then turned the bolt and entered. Emile followed.
Seated before them upon a ship-lounge, with a book
lying idly in her lap, was—Rebecca Mordecai!</p>
            <p>"Aha! and you have come at last, captain," she
said. Arising from her seat and turning her eyes
upon Emile, she continued, "Mr. Le Grande, we meet
again, securely as you deemed yourself beyond the reach
of justice. You see oceans and shell-guns are no barriers<pb n="174"/>
in the way of the accomplishment of my ends. You fled
from your country, thinking your foul crime would
never come to light; but 'murder will out,' and now,
you are my prisoner. Justice will yet be avenged."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean, woman? your tongue contains
the poison of asps. If I did not know your face, I
would swear you were some escaped inmate of a madhouse. 
Tell me your meaning, lunatic," replied Emile,
in wrathful astonishment.</p>
            <p>"Call me lunatic, if you dare, you miserable felon.
Deny my words, if you please, but your own written
confession is in my hands."</p>
            <p>"Confession of what?" shouted Emile, stamping his
foot in indignation. "Never, never, am I your prisoner! 
I'll leave this cursed place,—"</p>
            <p>"Not so fast, my friend," said Joe Haralson menacingly, as Emile 
made an attempt to leave the room.
"Not so fast! I am promised much gold, if I bring
you alive to your native State; and that gold, my friend,
I shall have."</p>
            <p>"Release me! release me!" shouted Emile, "I am
an innocent man. This woman—"</p>
            <p>"Hush, my friend, or I'll stow you away where
your cries will not reach any human ear. Be quiet,
my lad."</p>
            <p>Emile saw that resistance was useless; and he said
calmly, turning again to Rebecca "Of what crime am
I guilty, that you thus hunt me as you would a wild
beast?"</p>
            <p>"Would you know?" she replied, with a scornful,
cruel laugh. "Would you know even half the crimes
that are scored against you in your native State?"</p>
            <pb n="175"/>
            <p>"You can tell me of none," he replied sullenly,
regretting that he had again spoken to this merciless
woman, into whose snare he had so unwarily fallen.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you think we have not yet discovered
who murdered Mark Abrams; but, sir, we have."</p>
            <p>"Who was it?" indignantly inquired Emile.</p>
            <p>"It was—Emile—Le—Grande," she replied slowly,
her fierce eye marking every emotion of his face.</p>
            <p>"Great Heavens. What an atrocity!"</p>
            <p>"Deny it if you dare, I have the proof."</p>
            <p>"Prove it, if you can. I dare you to prove it.
But I must leave this place. Such nonsense shall not
detain me longer. I know that you are mad.—Captain, release me. 
Do not heed the ravings of that
woman any longer."</p>
            <p>"I am pledged, sir, on the accusation of this woman, to 
convey you safely back to the State, and back
you must go. I can allow you no opportunity to
escape."</p>
            <p>"I must see my wife first. I cannot go without
it."</p>
            <p>"The vessel is ready to start. It will be impossible
for you to see her. If you are quiet and obedient, you
shall not be manacled; if you resist, we shall stow you
away in security. Be wise now, and be silent."</p>
            <p>"But my wife—"</p>
            <p>"In an hour the Tigress will be out of port, sir,
and you cannot see her."</p>
            <p>"Alas! alas!" groaned Emile. "In Heaven's
name, why has this evil befallen me?" and quickly
sinking down upon a cabin stool, he said, "Keep me
from the presence of this wretched lunatic, captain, if I<pb n="176"/>
must go. Yes, if I must be stolen in this cowardly
way, from a peaceful home, and taken from a loving
wife and innocent, helpless child, I can but submit;
but keep that wretched woman out of my presence, I
implore you."</p>
            <p>"My friend, you may stay in here," replied the
relentless captain, "till we are out of port;" and
opening the door of a small room that contained only
a port-hole of a window, he locked Emile in, and
then busied himself with preparations for a speedy
departure. Once shut in, Emile drew from his pocket
a slip of paper, and addressed a line to Gardner &amp;
Company, urging his friend to go for his wife, and
come to him at once. From his diminutive window
he spied a slave near by, and quickly summoning him,
said, "Here's my watch, boy; take this note quick to
Gardner &amp; Company, and my watch shall be yours."
Then he threw the slip of paper out of the window.
Distressed and dismayed, he sank down again, nervous
and miserable, for fear the Tigress would depart before
his wife and Mr. Gardner should arrive.</p>
            <pb n="[177]"/>
            <p>RECEIVING Emile's mysterious note, Mr. Gardner went with
all possible speed to the young
man's home, and informed Leah of what had transpired.
"I do not understand this note," he said; "there is
certainly a mystery about this summons. The man
who came for Le Grande had a strange, mean-looking
face; but we must hasten."</p>
            <p>Leah, so long accustomed to sorrow, evinced no
unusual emotion at these apprehensive words of Mr.
Gardner; but calmly asked:</p>
            <p>"Do you suppose any harm has come to my
husband?"</p>
            <p>"I cannot say, madam; I trust not."</p>
            <p>"What motive could that man have had for deceiving Emile?"</p>
            <p>"Mercy knows, but it will not do to trust these
treacherous Spaniards too far. Still his story may
have been a truthful one. He was undoubtedly a
sailor. We will at least go and see. The pony and
chaise are ready."</p>
            <p>"Take care of my darling, Margarita," said Leah,
as she kissed her sleeping child, and stepped out to the
waiting volante.</p>
            <p>"Now drive fast, Mr. Gardner. My heart misgives me."</p>
            <pb n="178"/>
            <p>Without replying, Mr. Gardner urged forward the
fleet pony, and they did not slacken their speed until
street after street had been traversed, corner upon corner turned, 
and they were in sight of the Plaza de la
Mar, with its myriads of ships' masts and flags in view.
Then, driving more slowly, Mr. Gardner turned upon
the dock of pier number three, and looked eagerly
forward. There was no ship there. Alighting from
the chaise, Leah and Mr. Gardner approached a party
of ship-hands at work there, and asked:</p>
            <p>"Is not this pier number three, where an American 
vessel has been anchored?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, señor, but the American vessel has been
out of port an hour."</p>
            <p>"Out of port an hour!" repeated Leah, in dismay.
"Where is my husband, then?"</p>
            <p>Mr. Gardner shook his head dubiously, and said,
"He may have gone with them."</p>
            <p>"Gone with them?" said Leah wildly. "Gone!"
she uttered again, and then sank helpless upon the
wharf.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gardner, deeply moved, lifted her again into
the chaise, with the assurance that her husband in
all probability had returned to his place of business.</p>
            <p>Once more at the bank, Mr. Gardner was disappointed 
to find that Emile had not returned, but
instead, another scrap of paper was awaiting him,
bearing these dreadfully significant words:</p>
            <p>"They have stolen me away, to take me back to
my native State, to answer for a fiendish crime of
which I am not guilty. Send my wife after me as
soon as—"</p>
            <pb n="179"/>
            <p>Here Emile had stopped for want of time. He
had thrown the note into the hands of the same slave
who had carried the first one.</p>
            <p>"Take that to Gardner &amp; Company, and they
will pay you," he said, as the Tigress pushed from
shore.</p>
            <p>The ship had started; and Emile, alone in darkness
and despair, tried vainly to conjecture whence this
mysterious trouble had come, and what would be its
probable result.</p>
            <p>The captain of the Tigress, as has been said, was
a mercenary and rapacious man, caring no more for
a bleeding country than does a bird of prey for a
bleeding dove. So long as he obtained the gold of
his impoverished countrymen, and eluded the grasp of
the blockading fleet that so vigilantly guarded every
important port, he was contented. To the care of
this man, this iron-hearted captain, Rebecca Mordecai
had committed herself, in her endeavor, as she said,
"to recall Emile Le Grande to the bar of justice."</p>
            <p>"If you land me safely there, captain, I will give
you gold. If you bring me safely back with the culprit, I will give you more."</p>
            <p>Haralson, aware that the coffers in the Mordecai
vault were well-filled with the coveted ore, pledged
himself, and swore a terrible oath, that his ocean wanderer 
should accomplish this trip, even at the cost of
the last drop of his heart's blood. How successful he
was in landing and treacherously inveigling his victim
into the ship, has been seen. Then, after two days of
rather tempestuous sailing in a tropical sea, dodging
here and there, for fear of being pounced upon by the<pb n="180"/>
maritime monsters he sought to elude, Haralson landed,
at length, at an inlet, obscure but well-known to him,
upon the low, sandy shore of the Palmetto State.
With downcast heart, Emile once more set foot upon
his native soil, and at the bidding of his captor followed 
sullenly in the way she led. Chagrined, stung,
maddened almost, he trod the devious way that led
him back once more—back, back, to the Queen City.
Not back to his father's comfortable home, for that,
alas! was unoccupied, and the family refugees in a
foreign land. But back again, in a felon's manacles, to
find lodgment in a felon's cell—back to solitude and
despair, when at length, the grim old turnkey turned
the grating bolt upon him, and he was left alone in
prison.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
            <p>THE war still raged. Everywhere in all the beleaguered land, 
the tide of brothers' blood flowed
apace. Bitterness grew with every hour, and not
one heaven-toned voice was heard above the din of
carnage, saying, "Stay the madness, and let the blood
stop flowing." The end was not yet reached, the great
problem of this unnatural conflict not yet solved. The
bombardment of the Queen City still continued,
though with little hope of its surrender. But the
shelling went on, as though this murderous rain of
death were but a merry pastime, on those summer
days. The fort was now deemed impregnable; and yet
the hope of its surrender was one that could not die
in the hearts of the beleaguerers. Day after day, they
assaulted and reassaulted, and day by day were filled
with disappointment.</p>
            <p>At last, one bright June day was ushered in by a
terrific boom, and then, as if summoning the last spark
of hope and determination, the grim mouths of the
cannon belched forth, for many hours, such a rain of
shot and shell as will ever be remembered. The sky
was blackened early with the cloud of smoke that
rolled up from the sea—the sulphurous smoke that pervaded 
every nook of the city, and was borne away upon
every hurrying breeze to the far-off hills and valleys.<pb n="182"/>
One might well imagine the scene a very <emph>inferno</emph>; so
terrible was the conflict. Stern, dark, and resolute,
Defiance stood for hours—not a gun dismounted, not a
man dismayed. But the day grew late, and still the
booming cannons roared. The heavens above were
overcast, as though nature were ready with a flood of
tears to weep over the deeds of humanity. The lightning 
flashed, and the guns flashed, and here and there
and everywhere the dreadful shells fell thick and fast.</p>
            <p>At length one fell upon the ramparts of Defiance
and exploded—exploded with a crash of fury that said
to every listening ear, "Some dreadful deed is done."</p>
            <p>Alas! alas! The wild crash sounded the death-knell of one brave, 
noble heart, and crushed countless
hopes as George Marshall's soul went out. The murderous fragment 
of a shell penetrated his brain, and
his life was ended in a flash.</p>
            <p>Let nothing more be told of the sad story; nothing
but simply this: he was killed, and the troops left in
dismay and disorder—killed and borne to the last
embrace of the wounded heart that knew no after years
of healing—killed at Defiance, the place of weird,
mysterious terror to the widowed heart from the days
of her sunny girlhood—killed and buried away under
the magnolia shade, among the hundreds of brave
hearts that perished in the same unhappy cause.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
            <p>TIME stole along. Many months had slipped into
the past since the day of the lamented Colonel
Marshall's death—months of which this narrative has
little to record, save that they were months of blood.</p>
            <p>Returning to the desolate wife, left by an adverse
fate alone in her Cuban home, we find her sadly
changed. As sudden and unexpected as had been the
separation of Emile from his family, so shocking and
violent had been the affect of this trouble upon Leah's
delicate nature. From the hour when Mr. Gardner
informed her of her husband's mysterious disappearance, 
Leah sank down, overwhelmed with grief. Then
for many weeks she lingered through an almost hopeless 
illness, to recover at length and find herself still
alone.</p>
            <p>The hope of gaining strength to follow her husband
was the one hope that cheered her hours of convalescence, 
and stimulated the efforts of nature in the work
of recovery. At last, time brought relief, and after
many months of weary waiting, hoping, watching, the
opportunity was at hand for Leah to start in pursuit of
her husband. Committed to the care of a kind-hearted
man, himself the captain of a blockade-runner, the
anxious wife hoped to reach the shores of her native
State in safety. Unlike the treacherous Joe Haralson,<pb n="184"/>
the captain of the Cotton States, the vessel upon which
Leah embarked, was not familiar with the sea-coast of
many of the blockaded States; but, urged by her importunities, 
the kind captain determined, if possible, to
land her in safety upon the coast of her native State.
In this attempt, however, he was disappointed. It was
late one afternoon as the Cotton States was about to
anchor safely in an obscure harbor of a small island
near the main-land, when the captain discovered, far off
on the sea, the dark form of a pursuing gun-boat.
Immediately he put to sea, and fortunately, the gathering 
shades of night obscured the pursued vessel in
time to prevent capture. The next day, the Cotton
States ran ashore on a lone, sparsely inhabited coast, and,
anchored at Sandy Bar, a place known to but few as a
possible port of entry.</p>
            <p>In this obscure port of entry, the Cotton States was
the only vessel that had ever cast anchor. Here, erected
on the shore, was a rude, commodious warehouse, built
by the speculators who owned this adventurous craft,
and designed for the reception of the cotton that was
taken out and the cargoes that were brought in by it.
The care of this depot of supplies and unlawful merchandise 
was committed to a rather decrepit, but trustworthy old man, 
called familiarly "Uncle Jack Marner."
In a rude hut, near by this cache above ground, lived
old Uncle Jack and his wife. Scipio, a trusty negro,
was also employed by the company to assist Uncle Jack
in watching the depot, and was usually detailed to inform 
the owners of the vessel as soon as a cargo was
landed. In this obscure harbor—the White Sandy
Bar, as it was known to Uncle Jack, the captain, and<pb n="185"/>
the company—the Cotton States was anchored and
ready to deposit her cargo.</p>
            <p>"Madam," said the captain to Leah, "I have done
the best I could. I tried to land you nearer your
home, but could not; I trust you will bear me no
ill-will."</p>
            <p>"I can never forget your kindness, sir; once on
land, no matter how far from the Queen City, I know
I can find my way there. I feel assured my husband
is there, if living, and thither I shall go at once."</p>
            <p>"Not alone?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes; alone, if necessary."</p>
            <p>"Don't you fear the scouts and straggling soldiers
that so infest the land?"</p>
            <p>"I fear nothing, captain. I am in search of my
husband, and I shall seek him, though I perish in the
effort."</p>
            <p>"Well, madam, I shall intrust you to the care
of Uncle Jack Marner, and go away again knowing
that you will be well cared for. There's the old man,
and Scipio, at work with the hands unloading. I'll
take you to his hut."</p>
            <p>Leah thanked him kindly, and taking her child in
his arms, the captain led the way to the humble home
of Uncle Jack, and introduced Leah to his wife.</p>
            <p>Without delay the Cotton States unloaded;
loaded again; and was soon once more out at sea
in safety.</p>
            <p>"It's a mighty weakly lookin' child, madam," said
kind Uncle Jack, when he returned to the hut, after
the work on the ship was ended. "Is the little creetur
sick?"</p>
            <pb n="186"/>
            <p>"No; but she is not very strong, Uncle Jack," was
Leah's reply.</p>
            <p>"Teethin', maybe? Teethin' ginerally goes hard
with the little ones."</p>
            <p>"Yes," Leah answered, "teething has made her
delicate."</p>
            <p>"La, chile, the cap'n tells me you are bound for
the Queen City; ain't you afeerd to go thar now, sich a
power of shellin' goin' on thar?" And without waiting 
for a response, he continued, "I think, though,
the war-dogs are gittin' tired, and will soon haul off.
It's no use tryin' to shell and batter down that fine old
city. She never was made to surrender to any furrin'
power; and surrender she <emph>never will</emph>. I'll bet on that.
But, my chile, I should be afeerd to go thar now,
strong and supple a man as I am, much less a poor,
weakly lookin' woman like yerself."</p>
            <p>"No, Uncle Jack, I am not afraid. The soldiers
would not molest me, and the shells cannot strike me,
so I go undaunted. I am seeking my husband, and
must find him. How far is it, Uncle Jack, to the
Queen City?"</p>
            <p>"More'n a hundred mile, chile."</p>
            <p>"Can I obtain any conveyance about here to take
me part of the way, at least?"</p>
            <p>"Chile, thar's not a critter in twenty miles of this
place, as I knows on. Nobody lives hereabouts, but
me an' the old woman, and Scipio and Toby—that's
the company's mule, you know; and Scipio rides
Toby to ——, when the vessel gits in safe, to tell
the company. Scipio must start to-morrow to let the
company know the boat is in agin, and when he gits<pb n="187"/>
back I'll take you part of the way to the Queen City.
You kin ride Toby and I kin walk. I tole the cap'n
I'd see you on your way as far as I could."</p>
            <p>"When will Scipio return?" inquired Leah timidly.</p>
            <p>"Mebbe in a week, mebbe sooner."</p>
            <p>"Oh! I cannot stay here a week. I cannot stay
a day. I am so impatient to get on. If my husband
is living, I must reach him."</p>
            <p>"But how can you go, chile?"</p>
            <p>"Go alone, Uncle Jack. I assure you I am not
afraid."</p>
            <p>By Jupiter! Jack Marner let a weakly lookin'
woman like you start alone from his house, with no
strong arm to pertect you? Never, never, never!"
exclaimed the kind old man with emphasis, as he
shook his gray locks.</p>
            <p>"But there is no one to go with me, Uncle Jack;
and as I cannot tarry, I <emph>must</emph> go alone. I assure you
I fear nothing."</p>
            <p>The old man continued to shake his head, though
he made no reply; and then, handing little Sarah to her
mother, he went out of the cabin for some wood, that
was needed to prepare the evening meal.</p>
            <p>Night passed, and morning came soft and bright;
and Leah, refreshed from her slumber, expressed the
determination to pursue her journey at once.</p>
            <p>"If you will go, the Lord go with you, chile; but
I fears you will never git thar. Twenty miles from
here, you may find lodgings, and you may not; what
then?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, I can take care of that; only give me the
proper directions, if you can."</p>
            <pb n="188"/>
            <p>"Keep nigh the coast as possible, an' if nothin'
devours you, you'll find the Queen City after awhile;
but it's more'n a hundred mile, remember. I hate to
see you go, I do."</p>
            <p>"Do not detain me, Uncle Jack. I cannot, must
not stay."</p>
            <p>"Well, if go you must and will, I'll go with you
till we reach the open road; but I say again, you are
welcome to stay here in my cabin, if you will. It's
humble, I know, but old Jack Marner has had a sight
better home than this, in his day. Yet I thank the
Lord I have this one left;" and the old man brushed
away a tear with his trembling hand, as he assisted the
old woman in preparing some food for Leah's lonely
journey. At an early hour they were ready to start.
Uncle Jack took little Sarah in his arms, and Leah
bade adieu to the kind old wife, and following Uncle
Jack, stepped out upon the sandy beach and turned
her face toward the far-off, hidden road.</p>
            <p>For an hour or more, the pedestrians trudged
slowly along, Uncle Jack endeavoring the while to
amuse the child in his arms, who would ever and anon
stretch out its little arms and cry, "Mamma." With
downcast eye and heart, Leah moved steadily forward,
heeding nothing, save the occasional cry of her child.
Uncle Jack, as he walked along, had broken a green
bough from a swamp-myrtle, and gathered a spray of
blue winter berries, which he bound together as a nosegay 
for the child. With these he charmed its baby
fancy, and foiled every endeavor to reach its mother's
arms. At length the trail was ended, and the open
road reached.</p>
            <pb n="189"/>
            <p>"Now," said Uncle Jack, "we are here at last. This
is the road that leads to Sheltonville, the only place
that lies in your way to the Queen City. Keep it
straight, chile, an' mebbe you'll reach thar at last;
mebbe not; I don't know. Here, let's rest a minit
under this water-oak. Sit down on the log; I'll warrant 
there's no snakes under it."</p>
            <p>Leah slightly smiled as she obeyed this command,
and sat down on the crumbling, moss-grown wood,
saying:</p>
            <p>"Uncle Jack, are there any rivers in my way to the
Queen City?"</p>
            <p>"None, chile, but the Little Black, and you kin
cross that at Sheltonville. It's a wonder those dev'lish
soldiers hain't destroyed the bridge, 'fore this; but they
hadn't, the last I heered from Sheltonville."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I can get across, I guess," replied Leah cheerfully. 
"Rivers, nor mountains either, can keep me
from my husband now. If he is in the city, I shall
find him." Here little Sarah began to cry, and show
signs of weariness. In vain Uncle Jack flourished the
wild nosegay, whistled, sang, chirruped; the little creature 
would find lodgment in its mother's arms, and
sleep on her faithful bosom.</p>
            <p>The sun was getting toward the half-way morning
hour, when the little child awoke, and clinging around
her mother's neck she cunningly averted her face from
Uncle Jack, as if to say, "You shall not have me again.
I am tired of your wild nosegay."</p>
            <p>"Well now," said Uncle Jack, "the little creetur is
awake agin, and as spry as a cricket. Come to Uncle
Jack, won't ye?"</p>
            <pb n="190"/>
            <p>"I must be going," said Leah. "It's getting late."
And rising with the child in her arms, she drew the
small bundle of food and clothing that she carried
closer to her, and said, "I am ready. Good-by. Keep
straight ahead, must I?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, chile," replied Uncle Jack in a tremulous
voice, "straight ahead, and the good Lord be with ye."</p>
            <p>Leah was gone. She followed the sandy road
pointed out by Uncle Jack's trembling finger, followed
it till a small morass, thick with swamp-growth, hid
her from his view; and then the old man said, as he
turned sorrowfully back toward his cabin, "Poor chile,
she seems to have a lot o' trouble in this troublesome world. 
And she's so young and purty, too. I
thank the Lord there's a world up yonder"—and he
cast his tear-dimmed eyes above—"where no more
trouble will never come; an' may ole Jack Marner
be lucky enough to git thar."</p>
            <p>For ten long, weary days, Leah pursued the way
that lay straight and unobstructed before her, every
step bringing her nearer and nearer to the city of her
childhood. Scarcely able, much of the time, to obtain
food by day, or lodging by night, still she undauntedly
pursued her way, and kept her eyes straight forward
toward the end. Foraging parties, and straggling
soldiers, passed occasionally, yet not one syllable of
disrespect or insult was offered to the lonely woman
as she passed along, the living impersonation of unfriended helplessness.</p>
            <p>At length, in pain, in weariness, in tears, the journey was 
almost accomplished, and the evening of the
tenth day was closing in. The stars were stealing, one<pb n="191"/>
by one, into the blue heavens above, and the bright
lights of a hundred camp-fires, far and near, announced
the welcome fact that the Queen City was near at
hand. The stray shot, too, of some vigilant sentinel,
reminded her that, without passports, one could not
easily find ingress to the once peaceful, hospitable city.
As this thought came, Leah trembled; but she passed
forward undaunted to the dreaded sentry line that
stretched itself across her pathway. She was too
weary to weep, too bewildered to think, too anxious to
do aught but look forward toward the advancing city,
with its myriad lights, and then down again at the
innocent child asleep on her bosom. Upon the breeze
that came to greet her, as if in kindly welcome, she
caught the note of the old familiar music of the
chimes of St. Angelo. "Home, Sweet Home" rang
out upon her weary ear with all the sweetness and
familiarity of by-gone days.</p>
            <p>"How changed is everything here; and, alas! how
changed am I," said she; and tottering beneath the
burden of her child and the awakened weight of
memories, she would have fallen exhausted to the
earth, but for a sharp, ringing voice, that said:</p>
            <p>"Halt! Who comes there?"</p>
            <p>Recalled to a sense of her true situation by this
unexpected inquiry, Leah summoned the remnant of
her strength and courage, and replied, "Only a woman,
weak and tired. In heaven's name let me pass."</p>
            <p>"Advance, and give the countersign."</p>
            <p>"I cannot! indeed I cannot! But in mercy's
name, give me rest and food within the City this
night," she replied with a despairing voice.</p>
            <pb n="192"/>
            <p>"Whence do you come?"</p>
            <p>"From Sandy Bar, some hundred miles away, and
I have walked the whole distance. I bring you no ill,
or good news. I am nothing but a poor, helpless
woman, faint and famishing. I pray you, in the name
of pity, let me pass, kind sentinel."</p>
            <p>Touched by these imploring words, the sentry
looked furtively around him, and replied softly,
"Woman, be quick. Go on; and mind, if you say
that I passed you without the countersign, my head
will pay the forfeit. Go on, for Tom Marbray
hasn't the heart to say no to such a looking woman
as you are."</p>
            <p>"God bless you!" murmured Leah; "bless you a
thousand-fold;" and she hurried forward, and was soon
lost in the winding streets of the city, that was now
overshadowed by the darkness of night.</p>
            <p>Once more within the familiar limits of the old
city, she paused, and leaning against the angle of a
shop, looked curiously about her, as if endeavoring to
define certain localities. At length she said softly:</p>
            <p>"Yes, I see the Citadel, and Christ Church spire.
But I must rest. I'll enter yonder inn." She stepped
forward toward a shabby looking tavern a few doors
off, where a crowd of garrulous soldiers were grouped
about the door. Too weary to observe any one, Leah
staggered into the forlorn, miserably furnished reception-room 
of the Good Cheer House, and called for
food and lodging for herself and child for the night.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
            <p>THE ruddy beams of an October sun shone through
the one window of the little rudely furnished
room that Leah occupied in the inn. Weary from
her long, toilsome journey, she still slept. Though
tired nature for a time resisted the intrusion of the
garish sunlight, the chirruping of her little child at
length aroused Leah to consciousness. The tiny, dimpled 
hands were tangled in the long black hair that
hung about the mother's shoulders in dishevelled
grace, and the merry child laughed gleefully as the
mother awoke.</p>
            <p>"Is my bird always ready to sing?" said Leah
tenderly, as she beheld the innocent, happy child by
her side. "May you never know a note of sadness,
my love; sing on, while you may." Then Leah sadly
turned her eyes upward to the cracked, stained wall
overhead, and faintly murmured, "Here I am at last,
alone—alone in the Queen City, friendless and penniless—alone 
in the place where I once possessed thousands—alone in my search 
for the only being who loves me, in this wide world—alone, with nothing to
cheer me but my own faithful, resolute heart. When
that fails me I shall find rest. Poor, beloved
Emile!"</p>
            <p>Overcome by weariness, anxiety, and fear, Leah<pb n="194"/>
covered her face with the coarse brown coverlet of
her bed, and wept and sobbed in very bitterness of
heart. At length, astonished at the withdrawal of its
mother's smile, the child cried; and ceasing to weep,
Leah clasped the helpless creature to her bosom in a
fond, impassioned embrace. "God keep you, blessed
one!" she said with deepest pathos. "Heaven shield
you, my angel, from such sorrow as now fills your
mother's heart! But I must be up and doing. Weeping
will not accomplish the end and object of my coming."</p>
            <p>Arising resolutely, she hastily performed their simple toilets, 
and descended the narrow stairway to the
breakfast-room.</p>
            <p>The plain repast was soon over, the coarse, garrulous 
inmates of the inn departed, and Leah with her
child sat alone in the ill-furnished reception-room.
She had sent a wiry-looking little negro boy for the
proprietor, and was awaiting his appearance. Suddenly a 
thump, thump, thump, sounded along the narrow entry, and 
a short, red-faced, bald-headed, pompous
looking old man, with a wooden leg, stood before her.</p>
            <p>"Madam," he said, bowing obsequiously, "is it
yourself that desired my presence? Cricket told me—we
call that limber-looking little nigger Cricket—that
a lady desired to see me in the drawing-room."</p>
            <p>"Whom have I the honor of addressing?" said
Leah, with difficulty repressing a smile excited by the
grotesque appearance of the man. "I desired to see
the proprietor."</p>
            <p>"Exactly so, madam, and my name is Michael
Moran, the proprietor of the Good Cheer House these
twenty years."</p>
            <pb n="195"/>
            <p>"And have you remained in the Queen City during
all these dreadful months of shelling?" said Leah,
whose heart was at once brightened by the hope that
she might gather some desired information from him.</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes, child—beg pardon, madam, but, really,
you look like a child. Michael Moran is not the man
to desert the post of duty in times of danger. You see,
madam"—and he pointed to the wooden stump—"you
see, I had the misfortune to lose a member in the Mexican war. 
That wooden stump speaks yet of Michael
Moran's bravery, and I am the same brave man to-day
that I was in 'forty-seven, always ready to serve my
country."</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied Leah, "but you are too old to do
much for your country now."</p>
            <p>"Yes; that is to say, I am not able to take up
arms, but then I have done valiant service by furnishing 
a very comfortable, thoroughly respectable wayside home 
for my country's unfortunate children. You
see, madam, the Good Cheer House is known far and
near as <emph>the</emph> place to find good food and lodging, at <emph>very</emph>
reasonable prices. The soldiers—alas! I know what a
soldier's life is," and the old man laid his fat, plump
hand on his heart, "the soldiers, I say, find out the
house of Michael Moran, and enjoy the good cheer he
dispenses."</p>
            <p>The old man, once started, would have continued
his remarks ad infinitum, 
had not Leah bravely interrupted him by asking:</p>
            <p>"Can you tell me, sir, if any of the refugees have
yet returned?"</p>
            <p>"A good many, madam. You see this infernal old<pb n="196"/>
shelling, although it's pretty pesky business, hasn't done
much harm, after all. It battered down a few fine
houses, and killed some men, but then I don't believe
the Queen City will never surrender; and by Erin I
hope it never will. If the soldiers, to a man, possessed the
heart of Michael Moran, they would stand out till—"</p>
            <p>"Can you tell me anything of the Le Grande
family—Judge Le Grande, I mean?" again interrupted
Leah bravely.</p>
            <p>"The judge? Oh, yes; I think they went to
France some months ago," replied Michael, with an air
of profound satisfaction at possessing some slight
acquaintance with so distinguished a man as the judge;
and patting his knee with his plump hand, he continued,
"You see the judge was not particularly a war man,
and—"</p>
            <p>"Do you know anything of the Levys?" again
cut short the old inn-keeper's volubility.</p>
            <p>"The Levys? Oh, yes; they fled long ago, and
are now roving the face of the earth. The bombs
well-nigh tore down old Levy's house, and I guess
that will about kill him, as he is as stingy as a man
well can be. If he had stayed by his suffering city, as
Michael Moran has—"</p>
            <p>"But Mrs. Levy was a widow," interrupted Leah,
seeing that the old man was coining his information
as he went, for the purpose of his own exaltation. 
"Her husband has been dead these many years."</p>
            <p>Determined not to be baffled in this quiet way,
Michael replied, "Well, this was another man, madam,"
and fearing Leah might discredit his fabricated story,
he added, "I swear by Erin it was another man."</p>
            <pb n="197"/>
            <p>"Well, sir, can you tell me anything of the Mordecai 
family—Mr. Benjamin Mordecai?" said Leah,
with a slightly tremulous voice.</p>
            <p>The old man's eye brightened up, and he slapped
his fat hand upon his knee with renewed force and rapidity, 
and replied, with an inquisitive squint in his
face, "Are you a Jew?"</p>
            <p>"I am a Jewess, sir," she said softly. "I feel an
interest in my people. What can you tell me of the
Mordecais."</p>
            <p>"Well, child, then listen to me again. I say emphatically 
<emph>madam, now</emph>. Well, old Ben Mordecai he
was a mighty rich man, had a bank many, many years,
and lots and piles of gold. In fact, he was my banker
at one time in my life, and to-day he can testify as to
whether Michael Moran was or wasn't a thrifty man
and the Good Cheer House a paying institution.
Some years ago though, I moved my business to another bank, 
ahem!" Here the old man eyed Leah
sharply, to see if these hints respecting his pecuniary
status did not impress her profoundly. Then he continued, 
"Well, I was about stating—Well, where was
I?" he said, with a puzzled look of regret, as though
he had lost, or was about to lose, some cherished remark,
so bewildering had been the thought in reference to
his money matters, "where was I?"</p>
            <p>"You were speaking of Mr. Mordecai's having left
the Queen City," kindly suggested Leah, seeing the
old man's embarrassment.</p>
            <p>"Oh yes; my head gets a little muddy sometimes,"
said the inn-keeper apologetically, as he rubbed his
rosy hand, this time briskly across the bald, sleek <orig>sur-</orig>
               <pb n="198"/>
face of his head. "Well, the Mordecais went away,
and I am told a poor family moved into the old man's
house to protect it. But the other week, a shell came
whizzing into the city and tore off one corner of his
fine house. I tell you, madam, the old man had a fine
house, sure. And, madam, old Mordecai had a fine
<emph>guirl</emph> once, and a few years ago she ran away 
and married some fellow, and it well-nigh broke the old man's
heart. They ran away, and went somewhere; I think
it was to the Island of Cuby. My banker told me this.
You see, madam, my resources are yet such, that my
banking business is quite burdensome to me. The
Good Cheer House is a fine paying institution, sure,
and—"</p>
            <p>"But what of the unfortunate daughter?" inquired
Leah faintly.</p>
            <p>"Well, as I was about remarking, they went
away to Cuby, and some months ago, perhaps a year
or so, they caught the scamp out there, and smuggled 
him to this country, to be punished for a murder
he committed some years ago, long before he was
married."</p>
            <p>Leah's heart throbbed wildly in her bosom, and
every limb trembled like an aspen; but the old man
did not detect her emotion, and continued:</p>
            <p>"He will soon be tried here. I hear the friends
of the dead man and the Mordecais are pushing up
the trial. When the trial comes off, I guess the banker's 
family will come back."</p>
            <p>"Is the unfortunate man confined in the old city
prison here?" inquired Leah, with a faltering voice.</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam. At one time a shell struck the old<pb n="199"/>
prison, and some of the inmates came nigh escaping, but
they have had it repaired, and now it's pretty full,
sure. If a bomb could strike it, and finish all the inmates
at once, I guess that would suit them. I don't
know why else they keep that jail full of thieves and
murderers. I am too busy with my wayside house, giving cheer 
and comfort to my unfortunate countrymen,
to bother much about the jail-birds. Yes, Michael
Moran is too busy for that."</p>
            <p>"What is my bill, sir?" said Leah faintly, oblivious
of the wordy Michael's harangue, and thinking only of
the prison—the dim, dark prison, where her husband
was languishing. "I have no money but gold," she 
continued; "how much do I owe you for my food and
lodging?"</p>
            <p>"Gold!" repeated Michael with eager emphasis;
and then, as if fearing to betray his characteristic love
of the shining ore, he added with an air of indifference,
"well, I guess, as you have nothing else, <emph>gold will do</emph>.
you owe me—" and he named a certain sum. "Remarkable 
low price. Michael Moran hasn't the heart to be
hard on a woman; and I know you'll be sorry, to your
dyin' day, that you had to quit the Good Cheer House
so soon."</p>
            <p>Leah made no reply and evinced no regret, as she
handed out, from her low supply of money, the amount
demanded. Hurrying away from the inn, with the
child in her arms, she hastened forward toward the
dismal jail that, as she well remembered, was many
streets away.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>On the same bright October morning that opened<pb n="200"/>
the eyes of Leah in the Queen City, Emile Le Grande
was pacing to and fro in his prison cell at an early
hour. The confinement of so many long, weary
months had left its impress on every feature; and pale
and emaciated he scarcely resembled his former self.
Before him, on a tin platter, was the coarse prison
breakfast, as yet untasted. Restless and miserable, he
trod backward and forward within the narrow limits of
his cell, now glancing up at the sunlight that streamed
through the narrow window so far above his head, then
turning his ready ear to catch the sound of every
human footstep that trod the corridors, or moved in
the adjoining cells of this wretched place.</p>
            <p>Despair had settled upon him, and death was a
coveted visitor. "Is it myself," he muttered, as he
convulsively ran his fingers through his hair, grown
long from neglect, "or is it some other unfortunate
wretch? Have I a wife and child on a far-off foreign
shore, or is this thought a horrid, hideous nightmare,
that comes to harrow my brain? O birds of the air,
I envy you! O breezes that wander, I envy you! O
sunlight, that streams through my window, give me
my freedom, my freedom, I pray!"</p>
            <p>Overpowered by these thoughts, the wretched man,
enfeebled in mind as well as body, sank down upon
the hard pallet, when the sound of footsteps was again
heard along the corridor, coming nearer, nearer, nearer
to his cell door. Startled, Emile heard the bolt draw
back once more and the door open, and the jailer stood
before him.</p>
            <p>"Le Grande," he said, "there's a woman below
says she must see you—a beggar; shall I bring her up?"</p>
            <pb n="201"/>
            <p>"Yes, man, in the name of mercy, bring her up.
I'd see a dog that would come to me in this lonely
place. Bring her up, beggar or not, though I have
nothing to give her."</p>
            <p>The jailer withdrew, and Emile's heart beat wildly
from the strange announcement that even a beggar
wished to see him in his wretchedness now.</p>
            <p>Again the footsteps resounded in the corridor,
coming nearer, nearer, nearer, to the cell.</p>
            <p>Emile had risen from his pallet, and searching
in his pocket said, "I haven't even so much as a fourpence 
for the poor old soul."</p>
            <p>The cell door opened. Emile saw the jailer, and
a woman with a child. His eye flashed bright, his
heart leaped to his throat. The woman's face grew
paler, and tottering forward she fell upon the prisoner's bosom, 
and gasped, "My husband!"</p>
            <p>He said, "Thank God. My wife! my wife! my
child!"</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
            <p>IT were impossible to chronicle the half that transpired 
in the eventful days of those eventful years.
Days seemed months, and months seemed years, in
their sad, slow progress. When the heart is happy,
Time's wing is light, but as every soul was sorrowful in
those dark days, so the progress of the years was slow
and dreary.</p>
            <p>To none was the time so dark, and hopeless, as to
Emile while he languished in prison, and to Leah, as
she waited for an uncertain reunion. But the hopeless
days had passed, and in unutterable joy the husband
and wife clasped each other again. Now, she was
never to leave him till the stern fiat of the law should
decide his guilt or innocence. In an obscure abode,
within the very shadow of the jail, Leah obtained a
temporary home. The inadequacy of her means would
have forbidden her more comfortable accommodations.
But she desired only to dwell in obscurity, and be
near, and with her husband, in his loneliness and misfortune. 
Without comment or observation, she passed
in and out of the jail as frequently as the stern prison-law 
would allow. The jailer was a man who had
occupied a higher position in life, and had sought this
place to evade the merciless grasp of conscription.
Often had he wondered at the pale, lovely face of this<pb n="203"/>
unhappy wife, and marked her tenderness toward the
child that never seemed to weary the faithful arms
that bore it so constantly about. "That woman has
a history," the jailer often said to himself.</p>
            <p>But the days passed, and ere Leah had been a
month within the Queen City, the trial was at hand.
Pressing measures in these awfully chaotic times, Mr.
Mordecai was about to bring his culprit to justice, from
fear that delay would prove dangerous, if not disastrous, to his purposes.</p>
            <p>"My darling," said Emile to his wife, the day
before the proposed trial, "I desire that you shall not
be present during the investigation of to-morrow.
I fear you may be subjected to insult and indignity
which I cannot resent, being in bonds. Besides, dear,
you can do me no good."</p>
            <p>"Will my father be there, Emile?"</p>
            <p>"I suppose that he will."</p>
            <p>"Then I <emph>cannot</emph> be present. I feel that I could
never meet my father's eye, unless I knew I had his
forgiveness and his love still. But how can I leave
you?"</p>
            <p>"Remain quietly, dear, at your boarding-place, and
await, hopefully, the end. I trust it will all be right.
I know I am innocent," said Emile, with a forced effort
at cheerfulness.</p>
            <p>"Heaven grant they may find you guiltless! But
oh! Emile, I fear, I fear, I fear something—I cannot
tell you how it is, but from the day you were taken
from our happy Cuban home, not a ray of hope has
illuminated my heart."</p>
            <p>"You must be brave, Leah, your sadness will weigh<pb n="204"/>
me down, and I cannot, must not go into the presence
of my accusers with aught but a look of defiant innocence. 
Be brave, be cheerful, for my sake, and the
sake of our innocent child."</p>
            <p>"Can I see you during the trial?"</p>
            <p>"I suppose not; but as it will consume but a few
days at most, you can remain quietly at your lodgings
till the end."</p>
            <p>"The twilight is gathering in your window,
Emile," said Leah, after a thoughtful silence. "I
should have gone an hour ago; your supper will be
late to-night, dear; but oh! I fear to leave you! It
seems as though you were going to your burial, to-morrow. 
What will become of me? What will
become of our helpless darling?"</p>
            <p>Distracted by the plaintive words and agonized
look of his wife, Emile said:</p>
            <p>"Would you madden me, Leah? Have I not
asked you to be brave, even unto the end? If you
falter now, I am lost. My health and my strength are
already gone. Only the consciousness of innocence
sustains me. Leave me now. Sheer me with the
hope of acquittal, and be brave as only a woman can be."</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, Emile; forgive my weakness; and
when we meet again, may the sunshine of a brighter,
happier day, dawn over us. Good-by, my own Emile,
my own beloved husband," and the wretched wife laid
her head upon the true, innocent heart of Emile, and
wept her last burning tears of sorrow.</p>

            <pb n="[205]"/>
            <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
            <p>FROM the day that Leah first found her husband
in the prison, and observed the coarse, uninviting
fare that was served to the prisoners, she had daily
prepared his food herself, and supplied it, too, from
her scanty purse. By the permission of the jailer, this
food was received twice a day from the hands of a
trusty negro woman, known to many of the prison inmates as Aunt Dinah.</p>
            <p>On this same evening when Leah parted so sadly
from her husband, she went at once to her lodging place,
and quickly prepared the tempting evening meal.
After she had gone, Emile, once more alone, crouched
down in a corner of his shadowy cell, and was lost in
sorrowful revery, till the jailer, unheeded, opened the
cell-door and handed in a basket, saying:</p>
            <p>"Le Grande, here's a supper for a king. Cheer up,
man, and eat it. Old Dinah brought it from your wife,
and she says the bread is 'perticklar fine.'"</p>
            <p>"I want no supper to-night, jailer. But I'll keep
it, for my wife's sake."</p>
            <p>"Old Dinah said you must eat, whether you craved
food or not; said you must eat to be strong." The
jailer deposited the small basket that contained the
tempting brown buns and some cold slices of ham, and
departed.</p>
            <pb n="206"/>
            <p>For a moment Emile still remained crouched in his
corner, and listened to the dying footsteps of the retreating 
jailer; then rousing himself, he moved forward,
and lifting up the basket, said:</p>
            <p>"For love's sake, I'll taste the bread, not from hunger. 
Heaven knows when I shall feel hunger again."
The daylight was nearly gone, but enough light penetrated 
the dismal cell to reveal the contents of the
basket. Taking up a soft brown loaf, he turned it in
his hand, then laid it down. Again he picked it up,
and said, "It is so nice, for love's sake I'll taste it."
Then he broke it gently, and there fell into his hand
from it a small piece of brown paper. Astonished,
he opened it, and read these words:</p>
            <p>"An unknown friend wishes to help you. Meet
me at midnight at the prison gate. I'll save you.
Skeleton keys and wires will enable you to escape,
Find them in the buns. As you value your life and
liberty meet me."</p>
            <p>"What means this?" said the terrified prisoner.
"Is Heaven kind at last?" and then he curiously and
cautiously opened the bread that, sure enough, yielded
up the secreted appliances for effecting his escape. In
astonishment, even terror, Emile held these unlawful
little contrivances in his hand for a time, eyeing them
curiously, and then half-fearfully tucked them away
in his bosom.</p>
            <p>"Who is this unknown friend, I wonder, that so
desires my escape?" pondered Emile, as he watched
the darkening twilight as it withdrew the last vestige
of daylight from his cell. "Can it be Leah who has
done this, my own desolate Leah? Can she save me<pb n="207"/>
at last? She upon whose heart I have innocently
brought such sorrow and disappointment? Alas! alas!
dear heart! But should it prove some one else, how
can I leave my wife and child? What if it should
prove to be an enemy trying to betray me into further
trouble? And yet I do not fear. This dreary cell has
made me tired of life, and death were welcome if it
comes in the struggle for freedom! No, I cannot stay;
I'll leave this cursed place, though I be betrayed again—leave
it, though my escape may take me heaven
knows where—leave it, and hope a brighter future is
bringing me prosperity and a peaceful reunion with
those who are so dear to me. Stay I cannot, I dare
not. My tormentors are insatiable, my innocence
disbelieved, my friends gone; money I have none. I
shrink from the coming ordeal. The promise of freedom 
is offered me. I accept it.</p>
            <p>"The clock is striking midnight. It is dark, very
dark, little keys; but perhaps you will not fail me.
Now I leave this cursed place; yes, leave it, I hope, to
walk the earth again in freedom. Blast my accusers!"
whispered the excited prisoner as he softly applied
the mysterious, slender-looking key to the heavy lock.
"Ha! how the lock yields to this delicate spring!
Softly! softly! or I may disturb some sleeping inmate! 
God knows how many weary vigils are kept
in this wretched abode. I'll tread this narrow corridor 
no more, I hope. Heavens! The outer bolt,
too, withdraws, and God's blue dome and bright stars
are above me! I am free from these cursed walls!
Now the gate yields, too! I am free! free! Thank
God, free once more!"</p>
            <pb n="208"/>
            <p>As Emile emerged from the prison-gate, and it
swung noiselessly back to its place, he gazed anxiously
about, and at once descried a dark, half-bent figure of
a man approaching him. His heart trembled.</p>
            <p>"Mars' Emile," said a low voice, as the unknown
figure approached close to him, "Mars' Emile Le
Grande, don't you know me? I am here as I promised."</p>
            <p>Affrighted at this seeming apparition, Emile shrank
back, saying, "Stand back, man or devil, whatever you
may be! Who are you? What do you want?" he
continued, as the unknown figure essayed to lay hold
of his arm.</p>
            <p>"Hush! hush! We may be overheard. Don't
be afraid. I come to befriend you. Mars' Emile,
don't you know me?" said the little old man, as he
pushed back the slouched hat from his face, and peered
into Emile's eyes. "Don't you know old Peter
Martinet?"</p>
            <p>"What! old Uncle Peter, who carried the 'Courier'
so long ago?" said Emile in astonishment.</p>
            <p>"De very same, Mars' Emile. I'se de same old
darkey now dat I was years ago, only not quite so spry.
You see I'se crippled wid de rheumatiz a little. But
come along wid me, man; don't wait here any longer;
we may be found out."</p>
            <p>"Is my wife with you?" whispered Emile eagerly.</p>
            <p>"La, no, man; your wife knows nuffin ob dis plot.
We must hurry."</p>
            <p>And can I not see her, Peter?"</p>
            <p>"No, man, if you wish to escape de bloodhounds
dat are on your track. You had better be quick, too."</p>
            <p>"I must see my wife."</p>
            <pb n="209"/>
            <p>"Be brave, man; be brave. Why did you leave de
jail, if you didn't wish to 'scape? Come along faster."</p>
            <p>"But where are you going?" replied Emile, as he
mechanically followed the hobbling guide.</p>
            <p>"Here, this way, follow me. I'll tell you by'mby;"
and then halting within the shadow of a protecting
building, the old man stooped to rub the afflicted
limbs, and said softly, "You see, Mars' Emile, I'se
kept my eye on you, eber since dey brought you here
to jail. I'se nebber left the Queen City, and nebber
will, an' I 'tended all de w'ile, dat you should git
away, if you wanted to. I'se made plan after plan,
and dey would not work, but at last I got help from
inside, an' den I got de keys; den I knew you was
safe, if you could only git 'em. So I hired ole Dinah 
to make some extry bread and slip into your basket
after your wife had fixed your supper. Dat was all I
could do. I heard de trial was to come off to-morrow,
and but for de rheumatiz, de keys would have been
ready a week ago. You know, Mars' Emile, old Peter
part Affikin, and what he can't do, no udder nigger
need try. He, he, he!"</p>
            <p>"But where are you going?" interrupted Emile.</p>
            <p>"Well, Mars' Emile, der's a blockader lying off de
Bar. I'se gwine to take you to it." Emile shuddered.</p>
            <p>"Nebber fear. If you stays on land, dey'll git you,
shure, an' I knows ebry foot ob de harbor as well as I
do de city. Ain't Peter Martinet been here eber
since the Revolution War? No man here knows de
harbor better dan me, tripedoes or no tripedoes. Dey
can't blow me up, dat's shure. Come, let's go, be quick,
and be sly too."</p>
            <pb n="210"/>
            <p>Emile followed as one in a dream. Not daring, or
caring, to question his guide, until they were safely on
the edge of a pier that was several feet above the sea.</p>
            <p>"What now?" he said.</p>
            <p>"All right. I have a bateau tied down da, waitin'
for us. Her's de rope to slide down. But as you'se
afeerd, mebbe I'd better go down fust. Here goes!
I'se afeerd of nuffin, 'specially in de harbor." Emile
peered over the edge of the pier, and shuddered, as he
saw the dark figure disappear below.</p>
            <p>"All right agin, safe and sound. Come on. Mind
yer hold. Be brave, man, don't lose yer courage now, or
you may be a jail-bird de rest of yer days. He, he, he!"</p>
            <p>Stimulated to action by this stinging remark of old
Peter, Emile seized the rope, glided slowly down the
wall, and landed safely in the boat below.</p>
            <p>"Now I guess we's safe; no one can git us now,"
chuckled old Peter, as he grasped the oars and rowed
away.</p>
            <p>Emile made no reply, and for a time the plash of
the oars was the only sound that broke the stillness.</p>
            <p>"Do you know that they'll receive me?" at length
said Emile, as he saw the shore receding.</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes; more'n once have I carried men to the
blockaders—some who didn't want to fight, and some
who had friends on the udder side. Dey allus paid ole
Peter well, and he nebber fail to git 'em away safe.
He, he, he."</p>
            <p>"Why did you do this for me, Peter? For me
who had scarcely a friend in the world; for me, who
can repay you in nothing but gratitude?" asked Emile
with emotion.</p>
            <pb n="211"/>
            <p>"Oh, old Peter don't always work for money;
sometime he do for love. It's for love this time, Mars'
Emile."</p>
            <p>"How far is the vessel away, Peter?"</p>
            <p>"Five mile from de pier; you see de lights ob de
vessel yonder, sir."</p>
            <p>Emile was silent, thinking of the desolate wife and
unfortunate child whom he was leaving farther behind
at every stroke of the oars.</p>
            <p>"I must send a letter back by you, Peter; promise
me that my wife shall get it."</p>
            <p>"I promise, Mars' Emile. But be brave, man, be
brave; remember you'se a free man now; freedom
mighty sweet, Mars' Emile. I'se ben free dese twenty
years, eber sence old Marster Martinet died. He gin
me freedom. Ship ahoy, here we are," said the old
negro, as he came alongside of the grim iron-clad, that
stood like a huge rock in mid-ocean. Then the old
man blew a shrill whistle through his hands that penetrated 
to the inmost recess of the man-of-war.</p>
            <p>"Halloo! Is it you, Peter?" screamed back the
mate, as he swung a huge lantern over the side of the
vessel and looked down into the water below. "What
brings you now, old humpback?"</p>
            <p>"A friend, a man, a recruit to your sarvice, if ye
wish. Take him, an' do as you please."</p>
            <p>"Won't you come aboard, old Peter?" added the
jolly tar, aroused to receive the escaping prisoner.
"It's been so long since we saw you, we did not know
but a shell had picked you up. Come aboard, General,
we'll show you some more bombs."</p>
            <p>"Not this time, cap'n, my rheumatiz is rather bad<pb n="212"/>
for so much climbin.' I'll jes' wait down here for a
letter. Ole Peter Martinet ain't feered of fishes. He,
he, he!"</p>
            <p>Emile's letter was written and handed to old Peter,
who was soon again steering landward. When the sun
shone again in the Queen City, old Peter was hobbling
along his daily round of duty, singing occasionally in
his own peculiar way, and wearing an expression as
innocent as though the night-time had been an undisturbed 
season of peaceful repose and beautiful dreams.</p>
            <p>A letter found upon the door-way of Leah's lodgings, 
addressed to her, was picked up and handed to
her about the hour that the jail was thrown into a
tumult of consternation over the discovery that Emile
Le Grande had escaped.</p>
            <p>How and whence this letter came was ever a
mystery.</p>

cost my life to obtain it. I dare not look ahead; but
be hopeful and brave, faithful, loving Leah, and
patiently await a brighter day. When this wretched
war is ended, if I cannot come to you, you shall come
to me. Living, longing, hoping, for that coming time,

            <p>Bravely, calmly, Leah read this fatal letter; and
then, with a fortitude and heroism peculiar to her own
glorious people, she folded it, and placed it upon her
heart, so torn by sorrow and suspense. After the first
shock of disappointment was over, she turned her
thoughts to the formidable question, how she should
earn bread for herself and her child; and when once
her plans were made, she carried them out resolutely,
in poverty, weakness, and obscurity. Of the days,
months, and years that passed over her heroic head,
with their trials, struggles, disappointments, tears,
heart-aches, and agonies, before death brought relief,
this record, in pity, is silent.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XLI.</head>
            <p>THE war-cloud rolled away. The dark, wild, sanguinary 
cloud, that had swept with such devastating fury over a 
land where war was deemed
impossible, was passed. The roar of cannon ceased,
the rattle of musketry was no more heard in the land.
Again the nation was at peace, undismembered, triumphant. 
Once more its proud flag floated, unmolested
and gay, from every rampart and flag-staff in the wide
domain. On the one hand, there were bonfires and
pealing bells, huzzahs, greetings, congratulations, rejoicings 
over the termination of the conflict, while on the
other, sorrow and mourning, lamentation and despair,
filled the homes of a people, whose hearts were bleeding, 
and whose hopes were crushed. All, all was gone.
Only the cypress wreath was left, to remind of loved
ones slain, and beggary, want, and famine to point
with ghastly fingers to the past. The sweet sunshine
fell lovingly again upon that worn section of the land,
to find its fertile fields deserted, its homes destroyed,
and its people cast down. Here and there, everywhere,
far and wide, in many States, where the tread of the
monster War was heaviest, only the silent chimneys
and the neglected gardens gave token that the spot
was once the homestead of a happy, happy family.
Deem this no sensational record to elicit sympathy<pb n="215"/>
from stranger hearts. Only the sympathy of heaven
avails in man's extremity; and that sympathy, thank
God, his war-worn people have had.</p>
            <p>This same memorable time that brought peace to
the nation with such unexpected suddenness, found
hundreds, even thousands of people, still refugees.
Then many, regathering their shattered hopes and
courage, sought their former homes. Many, alas!
dispirited by loss of friends and fortune, dared not
turn their sorrowful eyes backward, but chose rather to
remain quietly where the final crash had found them.
Refugee! O reader, kind or careless reader, think not 
lightly or scornfully of the word.</p>
            <p>So far as possible, the scattered denizens of the
Queen City had returned to their scarred homes.
Many who at the time of their departure counted
their thousands, and even millions, came back in comparative 
beggary. Yet back, back, back, they came,
who could, to this mutilated Mecca of their hearts.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mordecai again occupied his palatial home,
which had survived the wreck of bombardment, and,
unlike hundreds of his unfortunate fellow-citizens, he
was unimpoverished. Aside from the good fortune
that had attended his financial arrangements in this
country during the period of conflict, he had also a
banking connection in England, that would alone
have made him a rich man.</p>
            <p>So back to his home Mr. Mordecai came, not in
poverty and want, not in sackcloth and mourning for
the slain, and yet not in joy or contentment. From
the fearful day when he lost his beautiful daughter, his
heart had been darkened and his hopes destroyed, and<pb n="216"/>
through the eventful years that had slipped on since
he last beheld her face, a feeling of unrelenting bitterness 
had possessed his soul. Always angry with Leah
and with the man who had led her into disobedience,
he now felt still more bitter toward him, as he deemed
him a felon, a murderer, unpunished and unforgiven.
The change of place and scene, the rushing and hurrying of events 
during the years of refugee life, had
tended somewhat to crowd from his mind the thoughts
of his lost daughter; but now that he was back again,
back in the old home, where every niche and corner,
flower and shrub, were associated with her memory,
the father was miserable indeed—miserable because he
well knew that somewhere upon the broad earth, Leah,
if living at all, was living in loneliness and dreariness,
in poverty and sorrow.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XLII.</head>
            <p>THE first spring of peace gave place to summer, a
summer memorable for its intense heat. One
afternoon, toward the latter part of July, clouds dark
and angry overcast the sky, and peals of thunder and
flashes of lightning threatened a terrific storm. Pedestrians 
hurried homeward, and man and beast sought
safety under shelter. The waters of the quiet harbor,
tossed by rude winds, grew angry and rose in white-capped breakers, 
that broke against the wharves, piers,
and fortresses, as far as the eye could see. Sea-gulls
screamed and flew wildly about at this ominous
appearance of the heavens, while the songsters of the
woods, and the pigeons of the barn-yard, sought shelter
from the approaching tempest. At night-fall the rain
descended in torrents.</p>
            <p>Safely sheltered in his comfortable home, Mr.
Mordecai sat for an hour or more, watching, from his
library window, the fury of the storm. The tall,
graceful cedars and olive trees that adorned the front
and side gardens of his home, were swaying in the
wind which rudely snatched from their trellises the
delicate jessamine and honeysuckle vines that lent
such delicious odor to the evening winds. It tore the
flowers from their stems, and the rain pelted them
into the earth in its fury. Leaves were whisked from<pb n="218"/>
their branches, and blown out of sight in a twinkle.
A weak-hinged window-shutter of the attic was ruthlessly 
torn away and pitched headlong into the street.
All this Mr. Mordecai watched in amazement, and
then, as if some sudden apparition of thought or of
sight had appeared before him, he turned from the
window with a shudder, and said:</p>
            <p>"This is a devilish wild night. I'll drop the curtain."</p>
            <p>Seating himself then, by a brightly-shining lamp—the
Queen City gas works had been destroyed by the
shelling guns—he clasped his arms across his breast,
and looked steadily up toward the ticking clock upon
the mantel. Thus absorbed in reverie, he sat for an
hour; and was only disturbed then by a loud rapping
at the front door.</p>
            <p>"By Jerusalem! who can be out this wild night?"</p>
            <p>The rapping sounded again, louder than before.</p>
            <p>"Mingo!" he exclaimed involuntarily. "Ah!
the dog is free now, and only answers my summons at
his will. Good boy, though."</p>
            <p>The rapping was repeated.</p>
            <p>"I must go myself. Who can be so importunate,
on this dark, wretched night? No robber would be so
bold!" and grasping the lamp, he glided softly toward
the front door. He turned the bolt cautiously, and
opening the door a little, peered out.</p>
            <p>"Come, Mordecai, open the door," said a friendly
voice without. "Do you suspect thieves this foul
night? No wonder."</p>
            <p>Mr. Mordecai opened the door wider and saw Rabbi
Abrams, and a man so disguised that he could not tell
whether it was any one he knew.</p>
            <pb n="219"/>
            <p>"What do you want, my friend?" he said kindly.</p>
            <p>"Want you to go with us, Mordecai," replied the
rabbi, drawing closer his cloak, which the wind was
trying to tear away.</p>
            <p>"Go where?" asked Mr. Mordecai in consternation.
"Only the devils themselves could stand, such a night
as this."</p>
            <p>"Come, be quiet, my friend. I am summoned by
this unknown friend, to go with him to see a certain
person who <emph>must</emph> see me, <emph>must</emph> see you, too. 
That's all I know. Come along."</p>
            <p>"Don't wait, my friend, time is precious," said the
muffled voice of the unknown man.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mordecai frowned and shrugged his shoulders
dubiously.</p>
            <p>"Fear no evil, my friend, but come with me," continued 
the stranger in a reassuring tone.</p>
            <p>"The storm will not destroy us, Mordecai; I have
tried its fury so far," said the rabbi. "Come on."</p>
            <p>Reluctantly Mr. Mordecai obeyed, and hastily preparing 
himself for the weather, turned out into the
darkness and the storm, with the rabbi and the guide.</p>
            <p>Onward they went, struggling against the wild wind
and rain, and few words were uttered by either as they
proceeded on their unknown way. At length the
guide stopped suddenly, at the corner of a lonely, obscure street, 
and said:</p>
            <p>"There, gentlemen; in that low tenement opposite,
where a light gleams from the window, you will find
the person who desires to see you. Hasten to him.
I shall be back before you leave. Ascend the stairway
and turn to the left. Open the door yourself; there<pb n="220"/>
will be no one inside to admit you." Having uttered
these words, the guide disappeared in the darkness,
and Mr. Mordecai and the rabbi were left alone.</p>
            <p>"What can this mean, Rabbi Abrams?" said Mr.
Mordecai in a low voice, greatly excited; "suppose it
should prove some plot to decoy us into trouble? I
shall not go a step farther; we may be robbed or even
murdered in that miserable place. You know this is
Dogg's Alley, and it never was a very respectable
locality. What say you?"</p>
            <p>"I feel no fear, Friend Mordecai, though I admit
the summons is mysterious. If you will follow, I will
lead the way. My curiosity impels me onward."</p>
            <p>"But there's no watchman on this lonely beat, on
this wild night, that we could summon in a moment of
necessity; no street-lamp either, you see. It's dark, fearfully 
dark! Had we not better wait till to-morrow?"</p>
            <p>"No, come on. I am fond of adventure. Let's
see a little farther into this mystery;" and so saying, 
the rabbi boldly crossed the slippery street, Mr.
Mordecai following timidly behind. They were soon
standing in the narrow door-way that led up the stairs.
They ascended slowly, and turning to the left, they
discerned through the crevice beneath the door, a faint
light. To this chamber they softly groped their way,
and tapped gently on the door. No reply.</p>
            <p>"Shall we go in?" whispered the banker. "This
is an awfully suspicious place."</p>
            <p>"Yes, come on; I do not feel afraid."</p>
            <p>Gently turning the bolt, they opened the door; the
lamp upon the table by the window revealed the contents of the apartment.</p>
            <pb n="221"/>
            <p>In a corner, upon a rude bed, lay a man, a negro,
evidently sick, whose widely glaring eyes were turned
upon the door, as if in expectation of their coming.
Slowly lifting his hand as they entered, the sick man
beckoned the gentlemen toward him. They drew
near.</p>
            <p>"Sir," he said, and so faintly that his voice did not
rise above a whisper, "I'm glad you come. I was
'feerd the rain would keep you away." Then he
grasped the hand of the rabbi with his cold, clammy
fingers, and with an intense gaze of the wild eyes, said
again, "Do you know me, Marster Abrams? Tell me,
do you know me?"</p>
            <p>The rabbi looked earnestly at him and after a
moment's pause said dubiously:</p>
            <p>"Is it old Uncle Peter Martinet, the carrier of the
'Courier'?"</p>
            <p>"De—same—marster, de—werry—same.
But—de—end—ob—ole—Peter—is—nigh—at—hand, marster—wery nigh—at—hand!
Las'—winter—was hard—an'—w'en de—work—ob de—Curyer—stop—it—went—mighty—hard—on—ole—Peter.

            <p>"Can I do anything for you, Peter?" asked the
rabbi kindly. "What will you have?"</p>
            <p>At these words, the dying man, for he was dying,
extended his other hand to Mr. Mordecai, and clasping his, said:</p>
            <p>"Yes, marster—I want—somethin'. I—want—<pb n="222"/>
you—and—Mr. Mordecai—to—listen—to me; listen—to—me—a—moment.
I—have—something—to—to—tell—you."</p>
            <p>"Certainly we will," they replied gently, observing 
with pain the difficulty of the dying man's utterance. 
"What do you wish to say?"</p>
            <p>"You—see, Marster—Abrams, I—am—dying.
Ole—Peter—mos—done.  I—can—not—go—before
God with—the—sin—upon—my—soul—that—now—distresses—me.
I must tell it—for—I die."</p>
            <p>Here the old man strangled, from the effort made
to communicate his story, and the rabbi, gently raising
his head, administered a spoonful of water. Then,
after a moment's pause, he continued:</p>
            <p>"Ise—been—a—great—sinner, to keep my—mouf—shut—so long;
but—I could not—help it. Ole
Peter—was feered—but now—I'se feered—no more.

I know—he—will, marster—de Spirit has—tole'—me so."</p>
            <p>"Confess what?" inquired the rabbi softly, supposing 
that the old man's utterances were but the ravings of delirium.</p>
            <p>"A secret—marster; a secret—dat—I have—kep'—so long—it has
become—a sin—an awful sin—dat
has burnt—me in here," placing his feeble hand on 
his heart, "like coals—of—fire. Listen to me."</p>
            <p>"I knows—how—Mars'—Mark—Abrams got—killed, an'—has—known

            <p>"Merciful—"</p>
            <pb n="223"/>
            <p>"Hush! listen—to—me—my—bref—werry—short,"
he said, motioning the rabbi to silence, who had
turned pale with consternation at the mere mention of
his son's name.</p>
            <p>"Hush! Mars'—Mark—was not—murdered—as—everybody—thought—but—was—killed—by—de

            <p>With difficulty he drew it out, and handing it to
the rabbi, said:</p>
            <p>"Take it—it's—haunted—me long—enough. It's
jes' as I found—it—dat—night—only—it's—mighty
rusty. I'se had—it—buried—a long time—for—safe-keepin'.</p>

            <p>Silently granting this last request, the rabbi turned
suddenly to observe the entrance of the guide, who by
this time returned.</p>
            <p>Not a word was spoken a he entered.</p>
            <p>By the side of the table, where lay the pistol, the
rabbi and Mr. Mordecai both sat down, each in turn
eyeing the deadly weapon with unuttered horror.</p>
            <p>The dying negro's confession had filled them both
with sorrow and amazement. The earnestness of his
labored story impressed them at once with its undeniable truth; 
and with hearts distressed and agitated,
they sat in silence by the bed-side, till a struggle<pb n="225"/>
arrested their attention. Looking up once more they
both caught the voiceless gaze of the earnest eye,
which seemed unmistakably to say, "I have told the
truth. Believe my story. Farewell." Then the old
carrier's earthly struggles were forever ended.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
            <p>THE strange, almost incredible, and yet evidently
truthful confession of old Peter, fell upon the
heart of Mr. Mordecai with a weight that broke its
stubbornness, and at once softened his wrath toward
his unhappy and unfortunate daughter.</p>
            <p>The thought that she was alone in the world, alone
since the mysterious disappearance of her husband from
his Cuban home—alone and undoubtedly struggling
with life for existence, grew upon him with maddening
intensity. His heart became tender, and he resolved to
seek her face, and once again assure her of his love.
Immediately carrying out this good resolve, he sought
her, first in Cuba, but did not find her; and to his bitter 
disappointment, all his subsequent efforts proved unavailing. 
Months passed, and grieving from day to day
over the unfilled hope of meeting her and atoning for
his severity by a manifold manifestation of tenderness,
Mr. Mordecai lived on in sorrow as the months slowly
passed by.</p>
            <p>He little dreamt that, not many leagues from his
door, his lovely daughter was performing, in weakness,
in sorrow, even broken-hearted, the wearisome task
that gave daily bread to herself and child.</p>
            <p>And yet Leah had often seen her father, so changed
by sorrow since she last embraced him; seen him only<pb n="227"/>
to creep away into deeper obscurity, dreading to confront 
his anger, and determined not to meet his coldness.
And so changed indeed was she, that not a single soul
among the scores she often passed, and who were once
friends, had ever suspected her identity. Such were
the workings of sorrow and misfortune.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>In quiet Bellevue street in the Queen City, still
stood the only monument erected there during the war,
that was worthy of perpetuation. It was the Bellevue
Street Home for the Friendless. During the war, this
institution was known as the Bellevue Street Hospital,
and there many brave soldiers perished, and many recovered 
from ghastly wounds under the kindly care
and attention of its efficient managers.</p>
            <p>After the first shock of her grief was passed, Eliza
Heartwell Marshall had been called to the position of
matron in this institution of mercy.</p>
            <p>It should be mentioned that, by the death of a
maternal uncle during her married life, this noble
woman had inherited a handsome estate, consisting
largely of valuable lands upon some of the fertile
islands adjacent to the coast.</p>
            <p>Much of this land the government had appropriated
to its own uses, during the war; but upon the restoration 
of peace, by dint of skilful negotiation the rightful 
owner had regained possession of the confiscated
property.</p>
            <p>Thus Mrs. Marshall was enabled to carry on her
noble work of charity, after the carnage had ceased
and the hospital was no longer needed for the soldiers.
So, endowing the Bellevue Hospital from her own<pb n="228"/>
private funds, she transformed it at once into a Home
for receiving those who, by reason of misfortune, were
unable to help themselves.</p>
            <p>Here, during the two years of peace that had
smiled upon the desolate waste left by the war, she
had toiled, prayed, and wept over the sufferings of
humanity, till she was deemed, and rightly so, an
angel of mercy.</p>
            <p>Time passed on. Though the Queen City had not
regained its former prosperity the Home prospered. Its
charitable walls were full, crowded even to their utmost
capacity; its business pressing, its necessities great.</p>
            <p>"Miss Lizzie," said Maum Isbel one day, as the
vigilant matron was performing her accustomed round
of duty, "Mrs. Moses, de lady who do de small washin', 
have sent word that she is sick an' can't do it dis
week. De chile who came said she were wery sick,
an' would like to see you."</p>
            <p>"Do you know where she lives, Maum Isbel?"</p>
            <p>"No. 15 Market street, ma'am, de chile said; please
remember."</p>
            <p>"Get me another woman, Maum Isbel, to fill her
place; the work cannot stop. I will go at once to see
her. Poor creature! She has looked pale and delicate ever 
since she sought work at the Home."</p>
            <p>Without delay, Mrs. Marshall hurried out on her
mission of charity, and tarried not until she stood confronting 
a low, miserable looking tenement house on
Market street. Her knock at the designated door
was answered by an untidy, rough-looking woman, who
came into the narrow dingy entry, and after eyeing
the matron sharply, said coarsely:</p>
            <pb n="229"/>
            <p>"What do you want?"</p>
            <p>"Does Mrs. Moses live here?"</p>
            <p>"Yes; but she's very poorly to-day; ain't been up
at all. Indeed she's been poorly for a week or more."</p>
            <p>"Can I see her?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, come in; she's in thar," pointing to a
small room cut off from the end of the narrow hall-way.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Marshall approached the small room, and 
answered the summons of a feeble voice that said,
"Come in."</p>
            <p>On entering the room, she found the woman prostrated 
on a low, comfortless bed; pale, feeble, and exhausted. 
By the bed-side, on a chair, were a phial
and a Hebrew prayer-book.</p>
            <p>"I am so glad you have come," said the sick
woman, "I am so weak this morning. You see I
coughed all night. I felt that I must see you. I
hope it gave you no trouble to come."</p>
            <p>"None whatever. Why have you not sent for me
before?"</p>
            <p>"I hoped, from day to day, to be strong enough to
do the washing for the Home again. But instead of
growing better, I have grown worse daily. Heaven
only knows what I'll do when I cannot work."</p>
            <p>"Where is your little daughter?"</p>
            <p>"Gone to the baker's, to get me a warm bun.
She fancied I could eat one, dear child!"</p>
            <p>Touched by these surroundings of poverty and distress, 
Mrs. Marshall could scarcely repress her tears;
but said:</p>
            <p>"If you will allow me, I'll give you some brandy;
that will revive you."</p>
            <pb n="230"/>
            <p>"Indeed, I have none; I used the last drop yesterday."</p>
            <p>"Then I beg that you will allow me to remove you
to the Home till you are recovered. There, under Dr.
Gibbs's kind care, you may convalesce rapidly. Here,
you are suffering for every comfort, and cannot hope
to recover soon. I beg you to go."</p>
            <p>For a moment, the sick woman made no reply, but
her lips trembled with emotion, and at length she said
sadly:</p>
            <p>"I fear I shall never be well again."</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes; be cheerful. I promise that you shall
want for nothing at the Home."</p>
            <p>"Can my child go with me there?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, you will need her there, as you do here."</p>
            <p>"But I have no money."</p>
            <p>"There is none needed. Just promise to go, and
I'll see that you are removed at once."</p>
            <p>Reluctantly and tearfully Mrs. Moses at last yielded
to the matron's entreaties, repeatedly assuring her
that she would endeavor to pay her, when she should
regain her health and strength.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Marshall remained a while, awaiting the return
of the little child. At length she came bounding in
with a bright, happy face, holding aloft the coveted
bun, and exclaiming wildly, "See, mamma! here it is,
nice and warm. Eat it, mamma!"</p>
            <p>The matron then departed, promising to make immediate 
preparations for the mother's speedy removal.</p>
         </div>

            <head>CHAPTER XLIV.</head>
            <p>IT was only two months after the kind matron of the
Bellevue Home had the invalid Mrs. Moses removed to its 
hospitable walls, before she saw, with
regret, that the life she sought to save was fast passing
away. The delicate frame was rapidly yielding to the
devastation of consumption. All the skill and attention 
of kind Dr. Gibbs had proved unavailing. It
was too evident that she must soon die.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of a soft June day, succeeding a
terrible night with the invalid, Mrs. Marshall had
withdrawn for a moment's rest from the fatigue of
watching and nursing. Her slumber was soon broken,
however, by Maum Isbel, who, unceremoniously
thrusting her head into her chamber, said in an excited tone:</p>
            <p>"Miss Lizzie! Miss Lizzie! Mis' Moses says she
would like to see you at once. She seem werry bad
to me, ma'am, werry bad indeed; she's so weak!"</p>
            <p>"Hasn't the doctor come yet, maum Isbel? I
have been expecting him this hour," replied Mrs.
Marshall, arising and preparing to go at once to her
patient.</p>
            <p>"Not yet, ma'am."</p>
            <p>"If he comes, send him in at once; but I feel sure
he can do the poor woman no good now. Her life<pb n="232"/>
is nearly done." Maum Isbel sighed, and dropped a
tear at these ominous words; and then she shambled
along into ward number two, to inspect the washing
that Mark Antony Briggs, a colored man of her acquaintance, 
was doing there. There she grew garrulous over the demerits 
of the work, and soon forgot
her emotion and her sympathy for the invalid. In the
meantime, Mrs. Marshall hastened to the sick-room, and
softly entered.</p>
            <p>By the bedside sat the pale-faced little child, holding her
mother's hand, and bestowing upon it kiss after
kiss of fervent love.</p>
            <p>"Mamma, here is good Mrs. Marshall come in
again. Mamma! mamma! wake up," said the little
girl as Mrs. Marshall entered.</p>
            <p>Startled by the sound, the sick woman roused from
her uneasy slumber, and turned her heavenly dark eyes,
so lustrous and bright, full upon the face of the matron.
Her eyes for an instant flashed, then filled with tears,
and dropped again. There was a strange, mysterious
expression in that one gaze, that thrilled the heart of
Eliza, and filled it with sorrow. "What can I do for
you now, dear Mrs. Moses?" she said with feeling.
"The doctor will be here soon."</p>
            <p>Lifting her emaciated arms, her body shaking convulsively, 
the invalid said, in a tone shrill with emotion, "Come here! 
Come near to me, Lizzie Heartwell! Come to these dying arms 
of mine! I can hold out no longer!" Confounded at these singular words,
and the more singular demonstration of an undemonstrative 
woman, Mrs. Marshall shrank back, and the
invalid continued, "Come to me; nearer! nearer! I<pb n="233"/>
can hold out no longer. God knows how hard I've
struggled! Lizzie Heartwell, don't you know me?
Have you never suspected your long-lost Leah? Have
my disgrace and degradation wiped out my identity?
In Heaven's name, is there not one trace of resemblance 
left to the friend who loved you so much in our
happy school days? O Lizzie Heartwell, I am indeed
your long-lost Leah! Your unfortunate, heart-broken
Leah! Your forsaken, despised Leah! Your dying,
dying Leah Mordecai! Is there no trace left, not one?
Here, see this—this hated scar. Do you know me
now, dear Lizzie?"</p>
            <p>Lizzie, who, terrified at these startling words, had
stood like a statue, sprang forward when the pale hand
pushed back the hair and revealed the scar, exclaiming:</p>
            <p>"Is it you, my long-loved Leah, my own Leah
Mordecai? In pity's name, why this disguise? Why
this cruel deception upon me, upon your faithful Lizzie, 
whose heart, like your own, has been wounded and
bleeding so long? Tell me, dearest, tell me while you
can; tell Lizzie Heartwell again of your sorrows."</p>
            <p>"Am I not dying, Lizzie?" inquired Leah with a
shudder, "I fear I cannot tell you all. My time is so
short. But I could not die without one uttered word of
thankfulness, without one kiss of recognition and love!
This, Lizzie dear, is the end of my unhappy life; this
the end of the wrong-doing of others; this the end of
disobedience—the bitter, bitter end. It's been a hard,
hard struggle, Lizzie, between pride and love, for me
to throw off my disguise; but love has at length triumphed, 
love for this sweet child," she said, laying
her hand tenderly upon her little daughter's head. "I<pb n="234"/>
could not die, and leave her entirely to strangers.
When I have told you all I can of my story, then I
shall hope for mercy from you for this child. It has
seemed so dark and fearful to me, this untried, unknown 
life into which I must so soon enter! God
knows how I tremble in His presence."</p>
            <p>"Have you tried to pray, dear Leah?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, dear; but still all was dark, dark, dark—is
dark yet."</p>
            <p>"Be calm, dear, and let me listen to the story of
your life. Tell me what steps have led you at last to
this strange end. Be calm, and tell me slowly. I
would know it all."</p>
            <p>"Be patient then, and listen. I'll keep nothing
back. If God gives me strength to tell it, I'll tell you
all." Then faintly she began her sad narrative, and
unreservedly unfolded the story of her life, from the
unfortunate day of her marriage, on through each succeeding 
year of sorrow, till she came at last, tremulously, to its 
sad close. Calmly she told how her father
had discarded her; of the removal of her husband's
father to France, where his family still remained; of 
Emile's misfortune, persecution, and forced desertion,
of his innocence; of her hopeless longing to see him; of
her despair as the conviction settled upon her that she
could not hope to hear from him again; of the harrowing 
suspense that had slowly eaten out her life; of her
penury and want—"and now, thank God," she said,
"you will see the end."</p>
            <p>Lizzie wept at the story, and when it was ended,
she said lovingly,</p>
            <pb n="235"/>
            <p>"Leah, dear, let me send for your father? I know
he would come."</p>
            <p>"Alas! the chillness of death is upon me, and the
thought of dying without his forgiveness is terrible!
Would not his blessing dispel this awful gloom, dear
Lizzie? Ah! a soul in the presence of its God is a
helpless, pitiable thing!"</p>
            <p>"Our Father is a God of love and mercy, Leah;
trust His goodness."</p>
            <p>"I prayed last night from my prayer-book, but
still all was dark. Won't you pray, dear Lizzie?
Pray for my father to come, with forgiveness, and that
his blessing may banish this gloom—this mysterious
gloom. Pray for me, Lizzie, pray for me now; and
then you may send for him. But stop! My child!
Lizzie, my child! What will become of her? Will
you not take her? Will you not keep her? Will you
not love her for my sake? I could not give her to
another. Tell me, dear. It's growing—oh! so chilly!"</p>
            <p>Eliza softly murmured, "Before Heaven, Leah,
I solemnly promise to deal with your child as I would 
have others deal with mine. Give yourself no further
sorrow for her, Leah."</p>
            <p>"Thank God! and now, you may pray for me;
pray that the gloom may be dispelled, and this death-chamber 
brightened by my father's forgiveness. Here,
clasp my hands. Kneel close to me. I would catch
every word. A shadow seems to hang upon everything! Now."</p>
            <p>Thrilled with emotion, Eliza sank upon her knees,
and with one arm embracing the sobbing child, the
other hand clasping the dying woman's, she prayed:</p>
            <pb n="236"/>
            <p>"Eternal God, our Heavenly Father, in weakness,
in darkness, and yet in confidence, we appeal unto
Thee for succor. In life, as in death, we are dependent 
upon Thy mercy and love, and yet, ever unmindful of Thy 
goodness, we must constantly implore Thy
forgiveness.</p>
            <p>"Grant now, dear Father—now, in this dark hour
of dissolving nature—a clear and sustaining view of
Thy goodness and mercy.</p>
            <p>"Draw very near, compassionate God, with assurances of 
Thy full and free pardon. Dispel with Thy
brightness the darkness of death that now enshrouds a
helpless soul; and take it, in Thy boundless love, into
everlasting rest. Manifest Thy forgiveness, O God, for
the deeds done in the body, and sanctify this soul for
the habitation of Thy Saints. As earth has been dark
and sorrowful, may heaven be bright and blessed;
and may faith be given now, in this hour of awful
extremity—faith to dispel the gloom that now veils
Thy goodness, mercy, and power.</p>
            <p>"Give light, light, O God, for darkness and terror,
and peace and joy for apprehension and mourning.
Eternal, ever-blessed, unchangeable God, send now
Thy Spirit and manifest Thy forgiveness. O Father,
let Thy sacrifice avail! Pity, too, the helpless orphan,
compassionate Father, and like a mantle wrap Thy love
about it. Guide its footsteps with wisdom, direct its
way with love, and may it live to Thy honor and
glory. Hear us in our weakness, helplessness, and
sinfulness, and to Thy eternal Being be everlasting
honor and glory. Amen."</p>

            <p>Releasing the little child, and unclasping the dying
hand, Eliza rose and said:</p>
            <p>"Now, Leah, I'll send for your father."</p>
            <p>"Well. Be quick!" and as a seraphic smile overspread 
her face, she added, "Leave me alone till he
comes, Lizzie, but be quick. I would see him now,
<emph>now</emph>; all is light, light, light! Joy, love, peace—<emph>at

            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>An hour later, Mr. Mordecai—in answer to a message 
saying that his daughter was dying at the Bellevue Home, 
and wished to see him—came tottering
into the hall-way, his face expressive of the deepest
sorrow; his head had grown venerable and gray, his
form was bent beneath a weight of grief that might
have crushed a heart of stone. Not a word was spoken,
as he silently took the hand of Mrs. Marshall, who met
him at the threshold, and led the way to Leah's chamber. 
The expression of his face told the anguish of
his heart. Noiselessly entering the room, they found
that the little child had fallen asleep on the foot of its
mother's bed, exhausted with weeping. The coverlet
was drawn carelessly over Leah's face, concealing her
features. Softly approaching her, Lizzie tremblingly
turned the coverlet back. Alas! she was dead.</p>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>On the bosom of the dead, as she was being prepared 
for burial, was found the miniature of her mother,
the birth-day gift of years ago. The jewels were gone.
One by one they had been removed from their places,
to answer the imperative demands of hunger and want.
But the face, the beloved face of the mother, had ever<pb n="238"/>
been pressed to the heart of the unhappy daughter.
And now, it was not to be removed, even by death itself; 
for the agonized father, beholding the evidence
of Leah's devotion, said, "As she kept it in life, so
shall she keep it in death. Place it again on her bosom.
Thank God, I shall soon sleep beside her in the quiet
burying-ground of my people; and may the eternal
God forgive my sin toward her."</p>
