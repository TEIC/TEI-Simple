            <p>THE pieces gathered into this volume were, with two exceptions,
                                        written for the entertainment of a private circle, without
                                        any view to publication. The editor would express her thanks
                                        to the writers, who, at her solicitation, have allowed them
                                        to be printed. They are published with the hope of aiding a
                                        work of charity,—the establishment of an Agency
                                        for the benefit of the poor in Cambridge,—to which
                                        the proceeds of the sale will be devoted.</p>

            <head>CHRISTMAS REVIVED.</head>
            <p>IT was six o'clock in the morning of last Thursday (Christmas
                                        morning), when Nathan Stoddard, a young saddler, strode
                                        through the vacant streets of one of our New England towns,
                                        hastening to begin his work. The town is an old-fashioned
                                        one, and although the observance of the ancient church
                                        festival is no longer frowned upon, as in years past, yet it
                                        has been little regarded, especially in the church of which
                                        Nathan is a member. As the saddler mounted the steps of his
                                        shop, he felt the blood so rush along his limbs, and tingle
                                        in his fingers, that he could not forbear standing without
                                        the door for a moment, as if to enjoy the triumph of the
                                        warmth within him over the cold morning air. The little
                                        stone church which Nathan attends stands in the same square
                                        with his shop, and nearly <orig>oppo-</orig>
               <pb n="2"/> site. It
                                        was closed, as usual on Christmas day, and a recent snow had
                                        heaped the steps and roof, and loaded the windows. Nathan
                                        thought that it looked uncommonly beautiful in the softening
                                        twilight of the morning.</p>
            <p>While Nathan stood musing, with his eyes fixed upon the church,
                                        he became suddenly conscious that another figure had entered
                                        the square upon the opposite side, and was walking hastily
                                        along. He turned his eyes upon it, and was greatly surprised
                                        by its appearance. He saw a tall old man, although a good
                                        deal stooping, with long, straight, and very white hair
                                        falling over his shoulders, which was the more conspicuous
                                        from the black velvet cap, as it appeared, that he wore, and
                                        the close-fitting suit of pure black in which he was
                                        dressed, and which seemed to Nathan almost to glisten and
                                        flash as the old man tripped along. He had hardly begun to
                                        speculate as to who the stranger could be, when he beheld
                                        him turn in between the posts by the path that leads to the
                                        church, tread lightly over the snow, and up the steps, and
                                        knock hastily and vigorously at the church-door. But half
                                        recovered from his wonder, he was just raising his voice to
                                        utter a <orig>remon-</orig>
               <pb n="3"/> strance, when, to his
                                        sevenfold amazement, the door was opened to the knock, and
                                        the old man disappeared within.</p>
            <p>It was not without a creeping feeling of awe, mingled with his
                                        astonishment, that Nathan gazed upon the door through which
                                        this silent figure had vanished. But he was not easily to be
                                        daunted. He did not care to follow the steps of the stranger
                                        into the church; but he remembered a shed so placed against
                                        the building, near the farther end, that he had often, when
                                        a child, at some peril indeed, climbed upon its top, and
                                        looked into the church through a little window at one side
                                        of the pulpit. For this he started; but he did not fail to
                                        run across the square and leap over the church-gate at the
                                        top of his speed, in order to gather warmth and courage for
                                        the attempt.</p>
            <p>When Nathan Stoddard climbed upon the old shed and pressed his
                                        face against the glass of the little church-window, he had
                                        at first only a confused impression of many lamps and many
                                        figures in all parts of the church. But as his vision grew
                                        more clear, he beheld a sight which could not amaze him less
                                        than the apparition that startled Tam o'Shanter as he glared
                                                through<pb n="4"/> the
                                        darkness into the old Kirk of Alloway. The great chandelier
                                        of the church was partly lighted, and there were, besides,
                                        many candles and lanterns burning in different parts of the
                                        room, and casting their light upon a large party of young
                                        men and women, who were dressed in breeches and ruffled
                                        shirts, and hooped petticoats and towering head-dresses,
                                        such as he had only seen in old pictures. They were mounted
                                        upon benches and ladders, and boards laid along the tops of
                                        the pews, and were apparently just completing the decoration
                                        of the church, which was already dressed with green, with
                                        little trees in the corners, and with green letters upon the
                                        walls, and great wreaths about the pillars. The whole party
                                        appeared full of life and cheerfulness, while the old man
                                        whom Nathan had seen enter stood near the door, looking
                                        quietly on, with a little girl holding his hand.</p>
            <p>It was not until Nathan Stoddard had looked for some little time
                                        upon this spectacle that he began to feel that he was
                                        witness of any thing more than natural. The whole party had
                                        so home-like an air, and appeared so engaged with their
                                        pleasant occupation, that, notwithstanding their quaint
                                        dress, Nathan only thought how<pb n="5"/> much he should like to share their
                                        company. But the more he studied their faces, the more he
                                        was filled, for all their appearance of youth and their
                                        simple manners, with a strange sort of veneration. The sweet
                                        and cheerful faces of the young women seemed to grow awfully
                                        calm and beautiful as they brought their task to a close,
                                        and their foreheads, with the hair brought back in the
                                        old-fashioned way, to become more and more serene and high.
                                        There was a strange beauty, too, about the old man's face.
                                        He appeared to Nathan as if he felt that the group before
                                        him only waited his command to fade away in the morning
                                        light that struggled among the candles, but he could not
                                        bear to give the word; and so they kept playing with the
                                        festoons, and stepping about the pews to please him. Nathan
                                        felt a cold thrill, partly from pleasure, and partly from
                                        awe, running up his back, and a strong pain across his
                                        forehead, seldom known to one of his temperament. Again and
                                        again he drew his hand across his brows, until he felt that
                                        he was near swooning, and like to fall; and he clung
                                        desperately to his hold. When the fit was over, he dared
                                        venture no more, but hastened to the ground.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>It was no fear of ridicule or of incredulity that led Nathan
                                        Stoddard to keep secret what he had witnessed. But it was
                                        like some deep and holy experience that would lose its charm
                                        if it were spoken of to another. So he went back to his
                                        shop, and sat looking upon the church, and watching, almost
                                        with dread, the doves that lighted upon its roof, and
                                        fluttered about, and beat their wings against its windows.</p>
            <p>The minister of Nathan's parish was a young man by the name of
                                        Dudley; and it so happened that he had driven out, before
                                        light, on the morning we have spoken of, to visit a sick man
                                        at some distance. In returning home, he had to pass along
                                        the rather unfrequented street which runs in the rear of his
                                        church, and close to it. As he was driving rapidly along,
                                        his ear caught what seemed the peal of an organ. He stopped
                                        his horse to listen, and a moment convinced him that the
                                        sound both of the instrument and of singing voices came from
                                        his own church; and it was music of a depth and beauty such
                                        as he had never before heard within it. Filled with
                                        astonishment, he put his horse upon its fastest trot, and
                                        drove round into the square, to the shop of Nathan Stoddard.</p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>"There is music to-day in our church, Nathan!" he cried to the
                                        young saddler. "What can it mean?" But Nathan answered not a
                                        word. He caught the horse by the head, and fastened him to a
                                        post before the door. Then stepping to the side of the
                                        sleigh, he said to Mr. Dudley, "Come with me, Sir." Mr.
                                        Dudley looked upon the pale face and trembling lips of his
                                        parishioner, and followed in silence.</p>
            <p>Nathan sprang upon the shed at the side of the church, and
                                        scrambled up to the little window. Mr. Dudley followed, and,
                                        with Nathan's help, gained the same precarious foothold.
                                        "Look in, Sir," said Nathan, not venturing a glance himself.
                                        Mr. Dudley looked, and had not Nathan's arm been about his
                                        body he would have lost his hold, in sheer amazement. The
                                        building was crowded, as he had never known it before; and
                                        crowded with people whom his eye, versed in the dress and
                                        manners of our forefathers, recognized as the church-goers
                                        of a century and a half ago. The singers' gallery was filled
                                        by a choir of girls and boys, while his own place in the
                                        pulpit was occupied by a white-haired figure, whom he
                                        recognized as the original of a portrait which he had
                                        purchased and hung<pb n="8"/> in his
                                        parlor at home for its singular beauty. It was said to be a
                                        portrait of a minister in the town, who lived in the last
                                        century, and is still remembered for his virtues. The sight
                                        of this old man's face completely stilled the agitation of
                                        the young minister. He was leaning over the great Bible,
                                        with his hands folded upon it, and his eyes seemingly filled
                                        with tears of pleasure and gratitude, and bent upon the
                                        choir. Mr. Dudley listened intently, and could catch what
                                        seemed the words of some old Christmas carol: <quote>"Thou mak'st my cup of joy run
                                                o'er."</quote> And he was so rapt with the sights and
                                        the sounds within, that it needed all Nathan's endeavors to
                                        uphold him.</p>
            <p>By this time the sound of a gathering crowd below, which he had
                                        not heeded at first, was forced more and more upon his
                                        notice; and the anxious voice of his oldest deacon calling,
                                        "Mr. Dudley! Mr. Dudley!" rose high and loud; while a great
                                        thundering at the front door of the church announced that
                                        the people below had also caught the sound of the music, and
                                        were clamorous for admission. Mr. Dudley hastened round to
                                        prevent their causing any disturbance<pb n="9"/> to the congregation within; but he
                                        came only in time to see the door burst open, and to be
                                        borne in with the crowd. All gazed about in wonder. The
                                        congregation, indeed, were gone, and the preacher, and the
                                        choir; and the room was cold. But there was a great green
                                        cross over the pulpit, and words along the walls, and
                                        festoons upon the galleries, and great wreaths, like vast
                                        green serpents, coiled about the cold pillars. The church of
                                        the Orthodox parish of —— had been
                                        fairly dressed for Christmas by spirit hands.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Dudley reached his home, after the wonder had in part
                                        spent itself, he found that an enormous Christmas pie had
                                        been left at his door by a white-haired old man dressed in
                                        black, about six in the morning, just after he had gone to
                                        visit his sick parishioner. The girl who received it
                                        reported the old man as saying, in a tremulous, but very
                                        kind voice, "Give your master the Christmas blessing of an
                                        old Puritan minister." How the meaning of this message would
                                        have been known to Mr. Dudley, had not the events we have
                                        told disclosed it, who can say?</p>
            <p>Need I add, that my friend, Mr. Dudley, from<pb n="10"/> whose lips I have
                                        taken down the above narrative, has directed the decorations
                                        to remain in his church during the coming month, and that he
                                        avows the intention of observing the Christmas of the
                                        following year with public services, unless, indeed, he
                                        should be anticipated by his ancient predecessor. It may not
                                        be impertinent to observe, that I am invited to dine and
                                        spend the day with the Dudleys on that occasion, and I shall
                                        not fail to make an accurate report of whatever glimpse I
                                        may obtain into the mysterious ceremonies of a Puritan
                                        Christmas.</p>

            <head>THE LITTLE SOUTH-WIND.</head>
            <p>THE little south-wind had been shut up for many days, while his
                                        cousin from the northeast had been abroad, and the clouds
                                        had been heavy and dark; but now all was bright and clear,
                                        and the little south-wind was to have a holiday. O, how
                                        happy he would be! He sallied forth to amuse
                                        himself;—and hear what he did. He came whistling
                                        down the chimney, until the nervous old lady was ready to
                                        fly with vexation: then away he flew, laughing in
                                        triumph,—the naughty south-wind! He played with
                                        the maiden's work: away the pieces flew, some here, some
                                        there, and away ran the maiden after. What cared
                                        <emph>she</emph> for the wind? She tossed back her curls and
                                        laughed merrily, and the wind laughed merrily
                                        too,—the silly south-wind! Onward he stole, and
                                        lifting the curtain,—<orig>curi-</orig>
               <pb n="14"/> ous
                                        south-wind!—what did he see? On the sofa lay a
                                        young man: a heavy book was in his hand. The little
                                        south-wind rustled through the leaves, but the young man
                                        stirred not; he was asleep; hot and weary, he slept. The
                                        wind fanned his brow awhile, lifted his dark locks, and,
                                        leaving a kiss behind, stole out at the
                                        casement,—the gentle south-wind! Then he met a
                                        little child: away he whirled the little boy's hat, away ran
                                        the child, but his little feet were tired, and he
                                        wept,—poor child! The wind looked back, and felt
                                        sad, then hung the hat on a bush, and went on. He had played
                                        too hard,—the thoughtless south-wind! A sick child
                                        lay tossing to and fro: its hands and face were hot and dry.
                                        The mother raised the window. The wind heard her as he was
                                        creeping by, and stepping in, he cooled the burning face:
                                        then, playing among the flowers until their fragrance filled
                                        the room, away he flew,—the kind south-wind! He
                                        went out into the highway, and played with the dust; but
                                        that was not so pleasant, and onward he sped to the meadow.
                                        The dust could not follow on the green grass, and the little
                                        south-wind soon outstripped it, and onward and onward he
                                        sped, over mountain<pb n="15"/>
                                        and valley, dancing among the flowers, and frolicking round,
                                        until the trees lifted up their arms and bent their heads
                                        and shook their sides with glee,—the happy
                                        south-wind! At last he came to a quiet dell, where a little
                                        brook lay, just stirring among his white pebbles. The wind
                                        said, "Kind brook, will you play with me?" And the brook
                                        answered with a sparkling smile, and a gentle murmur. Then
                                        the wind rose up, and, sporting among the dark pines,
                                        whistled and sung through the lofty branches, while the
                                        pretty brook danced along, and warbled songs to the music of
                                        its merry companion,—the merry south-wind! But the
                                        sun had gone down and the stars were peeping forth, and the
                                        day was done. The happy south- wind was still, and the moon
                                        looked down on the world below, and watched among the trees
                                        and hills, but all was still: the little south-wind
                                        slumbered, and the moon and the stars kept
                                        guard,—poor, tired south-wind! Old lady and
                                        maiden, young man and child, the dust and the flowers, were
                                        forgotten, and he slept,—dear little
                                south-wind!</p>

            <head>AUNT MOLLY.</head>
            <head type="sub">A REMINISCENCE OF OLD CAMBRIDGE.</head>
            <p>IN looking back upon my early days, one of the images that rises
                                        most vividly to my mind's eye is that of Miss Molly
                                        ——, or Aunt Molly, as she was called by
                                        some of her little favorites, that is to say, about a dozen
                                        girls, and (not complimentary to the <emph>un</emph>fair
                                        sex, to be sure) one boy. There was one, who, even to Miss
                                        Molly, was not a torment and a plague; and I must confess he
                                        was a pleasant specimen of the genus. At the time of which I
                                        speak, the great awkward barn of a school-house on the
                                        Common, near the Appian Way, had not reared its imposing
                                        front. In its place, in the centre of a grass-plot that was
                                        one of the very first to look green in spring, and kept its
                                        verdure through the heats of July, stood the brown,
                                        one-storied cottage which she<pb n="23"/> owned, and in which the aged woman
                                        lived, alone. Her garden and clothes-yard behind the house
                                        were fenced in; but in front, the visitor to the cottage,
                                        unimpeded by gate or fence, turned up the pretty green slope
                                        directly from the street to the lowly door.</p>
            <p>As I have started for a walk into the old times, and am not bound
                                        by any rule to stick to the point, I will here digress to
                                        say that the Episcopal Church (<emph>the Church</emph>, as
                                        it was simply called, when all the rest were
                                        "meeting-houses"), that tells the traveller what a pure and
                                        true taste was once present in Cambridge, and, by the
                                        contrast it presents to the architectural blunders that
                                        abound in the place, tells also what a want of it there is
                                        now,—this beautiful church stood most
                                        appropriately and tastefully surrounded by the green turf,
                                        unbroken by stiff gravel walks or coach sweep, and undivided
                                        from the public walk by a fence. Behind the church, and
                                        forming a part of its own grounds, (where now exist the
                                        elegances of School Court,) was an unappropriated field; and
                                        that spot was considered, by a certain little group of
                                        children, of six or seven years old, the most solitary,
                                        gloomy, mysterious place in their little world. When the<pb n="24"/> colors of sunset had
                                        died out in the west, and the stillness and shadow of
                                        twilight were coming on, they used to "snatch a fearful joy"
                                        in seeing one of their number (whose mother had kindly
                                        omitted the first lesson usually taught to little girls, to
                                        be afraid of every thing) perform the feat of going slowly
                                        around the church, alone, stopping behind it to count a
                                        hundred. Her wonderful courage in actually protecting the
                                        whole group from what they called a "flock of cows," and in
                                        staking and patting the "mad dogs" that they were for ever
                                        meeting, was nothing to this <emph>going round the
                                        church!</emph>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the cottage, from which the pretty, rural trait
                                        of its standing in its unfenced green door-yard led me away
                                        to notice the same sort of rustic beauty where the church
                                        stood. We did not stop to knock at the outside door,
                                        —for Aunt Molly was very deaf, and if we had
                                        knocked our little knuckles off she would not have heard
                                        us,—but went in, and, passing along the passage,
                                        rapped at the door of the "common room," half sitting-room,
                                        half kitchen, and were admitted. Those who saw her for the
                                        first time, whether children or grown people, were generally
                                        afraid of her; for her voice, <orig>unmodu-</orig>
               <pb n="25"/> lated, of course, by the ear, was naturally harsh,
                                        strong, and high-toned; and the sort of half laugh, half
                                        growl, that she uttered when pleased, might have suggested
                                        to an imaginative child the howl of a wolf. She had very
                                        large features, and sharp, penetrating black eyes, shaded by
                                        long, gray lashes, and surmounted by thick, bushy, gray
                                        eyebrows. I think that when she was scolding the
                                        school-boys, with those eyes fiercely "glowering" at them
                                        from under the shaggy gray thatch, she must have appeared to
                                        those who in their learned page had got as far as the
                                        Furies, like a living illustration of classic lore. Her cap
                                        and the make of her dress were peculiar, and suggestive of
                                        those days before, and at the time of, the Revolution, of
                                        which she loved to speak.</p>
            <p>But we, her little favorites, were not afraid of her. To go into
                                        her garden in summer, and eat currants, larger and sweeter
                                        than any we found at home,—to look up at the
                                        enormous old damson-tree, when it was white with blossoms,
                                        and the rich honey-comb smell was diffused over the whole
                                        garden,—was a pleasant little excursion to us. She
                                        took great care and pains to save the plums from the
                                        plundering boys, because it<pb n="26"/>
                                        was the only real damson there was anywhere in the
                                        neighborhood, and she found a ready sale for them, for
                                        preserves. She seemed to think that the <emph>real
                                        damsons</emph> went out with the <emph>real gentry</emph> of
                                        the olden time; and perhaps they did, <emph>as</emph>
                                        damsons, though, for aught I know, they may figure now in
                                        our fruit catalogues as "The Duke of Argyle's New Seedling
                                        Acidulated Drop of Damascus,"—which would be
                                        something like a translation of Damson into the modern
                                        terminology.</p>
            <p>But more pleasant still was it to go into Aunt Molly's "best
                                        room." The walls she had papered herself, with curious
                                        stripes and odd pieces, of various shapes and patterns,
                                        ornamented with a border of figures of little men and women
                                        joining hands, cut from paper of all colors; and they were
                                        adorned, besides, with several prints in shining black
                                        frames. There was no carpet on the snow-white, unpainted
                                        floor, but various mats and rugs, of all the kinds into
                                        which ingenuity has transformed woollen rags, were disposed
                                        about it. The bed was the pride and glory of the room,
                                        however; for on it was spread a silk patchwork quilt, made
                                        of pieces of the brocade and damask and elegant silks, of<pb n="27"/> which the ladies
                                        belonging to the grand old Tory families had their gowns and
                                        cardinals, and other paraphernalia, made. Aunt Molly had
                                        been a mantuamaker to the old "quality," and she could show
                                        us a piece of Madam Vassall's gown on that wonderful and
                                        brilliant piece of work, the bed-quilt. "On that hint" she
                                        would speak.</p>
            <p>"A-haw-awr! They were <emph>real gentle</emph> folks that lived
                                        in <emph>them</emph> days. A-haw-awr! I declare, I could
                                        e'en-amost kneel down and kiss the very airth they trod on,
                                        as they went by my house to church. Polite, <emph>they
                                        wor!</emph> Yes, they knew what true politeness was; and to
                                        my thinking true politeness is next to saving grace."</p>
            <p>Once a year, or so, Aunt Molly would dress up in her best gown, a
                                        black silk, trimmed with real black lace, and a real lace
                                        cap, relics of the good old days of Toryism and brocade and
                                        the real gentry, and go to make an afternoon visit to one of
                                        her neighbors. After the usual salutations, the lady would
                                        ask her visitor to take off her bonnet and stay the
                                        afternoon, knowing by the "rig" that such was her intention.
                                        But she liked to be urged a little, so she would say, "O, I
                                        only came out for a little walk, it was so <orig>pleas-</orig>
               <pb n="28"/> ant, and stopped in to
                                        see how little Henry did, since his sickness. You know I
                                        always call him <emph>my boy</emph>." (Yes, Aunt Molly, the
                                        only boy in the universe that, for you, had any good in
                                        him.) After the proper amount of urging, she would lay aside
                                        her bonnet and black satin mantle, saying, "Well, I didn't
                                        come here to get my tea, but you are so urgent, I believe I
                                        will stay."</p>
            <p>Aunt Molly's <emph>asides</emph> were often amusing. She was so
                                        very deaf that she could not hear her own voice, and often
                                        imagined she was whispering, when she could be heard across
                                        the room.</p>
            <p>On one occasion she saw a gentleman who was a stranger to her, in
                                        the parlor, when she went to visit one of the ladies who
                                        were kind and attentive to her. She sat a few minutes
                                        looking keenly at him, and then whispered, "Who's that?"
                                        "Mr. Jay." "Who?" <emph rend="fsc">"MR. JAY."</emph> "Who?"
                                                <emph>"MR. JAY."</emph> "Oh-o-oh! Mr. Jay. Well,
                                        what does he do for a living?" "He's a tutor, Ma'am."
                                        "What?" <emph rend="fsc">"A TUTOR."</emph> "What?" <emph>"A
                                                TUTOR."</emph> "Oh-o-oh! I thought you said a
                                        suitor!"</p>
            <p>Aunt Molly owned the little brown cottage, where her widowed
                                        mother, she said, had lived,<pb n="29"/> and there she died. As soon as she
                                        was laid in her grave, it was torn down, and the precious
                                        damson-tree was felled. I was rather glad that the
                                        school-house was so ugly, that I might have a double reason
                                        for hating the usurper. If Nemesis cared for school-boys,
                                        she doubtless looks on with a grin, now, to see them
                                        scampering at their will round the precincts of the former
                                        enemy of their race, and listens with pleasure while they
                                        "make <emph>day</emph> hideous" where once the bee and the
                                        humming-bird only broke the quiet of the little garden.</p>
            <p>Aunt Molly had a vigorous, active mind, and a strong, tenacious
                                        memory; and her love of the departed grandeur and Toryism of
                                        Court Row, as she called that part of Brattle Street from
                                        Ash Street to Mount Auburn, was pleasant and entertaining to
                                        those who listened to her tales of other times.</p>
            <p>Peace to her memory!</p>

            <head>TO THE NEAR-SIGHTED.</head>
            <p>PURBLIND and short-sighted friends! <emph>You</emph> will listen
                                        to me,—<emph>you</emph> will sympathize with me;
                                        for you know by painful experience what I mean when I say
                                        that we near-sighted people do not receive from our
                                        hawk-eyed neighbors that sympathy and consideration to which
                                        we are justly entitled. If we were blind, we should be
                                        abundantly pitied, but as we are only half-blind, such
                                        comments as these are all the consolation we get. "Oh!
                                                <emph>near-sighted</emph>, is she? Yes, it is very
                                        fashionable now-a-days for young ladies to carry
                                        eye-glasses, and call themselves near-sighted!" Or, "Pooh!
                                        It's all affectation. She can see as well as any body, if
                                        she chooses. She thinks it is pretty to half shut her eyes,
                                        and cut her acquaintances." I meet my friend
                                        A——, some morning, who returns my
                                        salutation with cold<pb n="42"/>
                                        politeness, and says, "How cleverly you managed to cut me at
                                        the concert last night!" "At the concert! I did not see
                                        you." "O no! You could see well enough to bow to pretty Miss
                                        B——, and her handsome cousin; but as for
                                        seeing your old schoolmate, two seats behind
                                        her,—of course you are too near-sighted!" In vain
                                        I protest that I could not see her,—that three
                                        yards is a great distance to my eyes. She leaves me with an
                                        incredulous smile, and that most provoking phrase, "O yes! I
                                                <emph>suppose</emph> so!" and distrusts me ever
                                        afterwards. Alas! we see just enough to seal our own
                                        condemnation.</p>
            <p>Who is free from this malady? As I look around in society, I see
                                        staring glassy ellipses on every side "in the place where
                                        eyes ought to grow,"—and perhaps most of the
                                        unfortunate owls get along very comfortably with their
                                        artificial eyes. But imagine a bashful youth, awkward and
                                        near-sighted, whose friends dissuade him from wearing
                                        glasses. Is there in the universe an individual more
                                        unlucky, more blundering, more sincerely to be pitied?</p>
            <p>See that little boy, who, having put on his father's spectacles,
                                        is enjoying for the first time a<pb n="43"/> clear and distinct view of the
                                        evening sky. "Oh! is that pretty little yellow dot a star?"
                                        exclaims the delighted child. Poor innocent! a star had
                                        always been to him a dim, cloudy spot, a little nebula,
                                        which the magic glass has now resolved; and he can hardly
                                        believe that this brilliant point is not an optical
                                        illusion. But when his mother assures him that the stars
                                        always appear so to her, and he turns to look in her face,
                                        he says, "Why, mother! how beautiful you look! Please to
                                        give me some little spectacles, <emph>all my own!</emph>"

                                        could?)—and little "Squire Specs" does not mind
                                        the shouts of his companions or the high-sounding nicknames
                                        they give him, he so rejoices in what seems to him a new
                                        sense, a <emph>second sight</emph>.</p>
            <p>I was summoned, the other day, to welcome a family of cousins
                                        from a distant State, whom I had not seen for a very long
                                        time. They were accompanied, I was told, by a Boston lady, a
                                        stranger to us. I entered the room with considerable
                                                empressement, but when
                                        my eye detected the dim outline of a circle of bonneted
                                        figures, I stopped in despair in the middle of the room, not
                                        knowing which was which, or whom I ought<pb n="44"/> to speak to first, and
                                        at last made an embarrassed half-bow, half-courtesy, to the
                                        company in general. A confused murmur of greetings and
                                        introductions followed, and, throwing aside my air of stiff,
                                        ceremonious politeness, I rushed, with a smiling face, to
                                        the nearest lady, shook hands with her in the most cordial
                                        manner, and then, in passing, bowed formally to the next,
                                        who I concluded was the stranger. What then was my surprise
                                        and utter confusion when she caught me by the hand, and,
                                        drawing me towards her, kissed me emphatically several
                                        times. "How <emph>do</emph> you do, dear? Have you quite
                                        forgotten me? Ah! You don't remember the times when you used
                                        to ride a cock-horse, on my knee, to Banbury Cross, to see
                                        the old lady get on her white horse!" What could I say? I
                                        was petrified. I could not smile, I could not speak. My only
                                        feeling was mortification at my most awkward mistake. Yet I
                                        ought to have become accustomed to such embarrassments, for
                                        they are of very frequent occurrence.</p>
            <p>"Why, Julia! what is the matter? How strangely your eyes look!"
                                        My sister at this exclamation turns round, and I discover
                                        that from the other end of the room I have been <orig>gaz-</orig>

                                        her "back hair," which is twisted in a "pug," or
                                        "bob,"— which is the correct term?—and
                                        surmounted by a tortoise-shell comb.</p>
            <p>But in the whole course of my numerous mistakes and blunders,
                                        whether ludicrous, serious, or embarrassing, I believe I
                                        have never mistaken a cow for a human being, as was done by
                                        old Dr. E——. It was many years ago, when
                                        Boston Common was still used as a pasture, and cows were
                                        daily to be met in the crooked streets of the city, that
                                        this gentleman, distinguished for the courtesy and
                                        old-school politeness of his manner, no less than for his
                                        extreme near-sightedness, was walking at a brisk pace, one
                                        winter's day, and saw, just before him, a lady, as he
                                        thought, richly dressed in furs. As he was passing her, he
                                        thought he perceived that her fur boa or tippet had escaped
                                        from her neck, and, carefully lifting the end of it with one
                                        hand, he made a low bow, raising his hat with the other, and
                                        said in his blandest tone, "Madam, you are losing your
                                        tippet!" And what thanks did the worthy Doctor receive, do
                                        you think, for this truly kind and polite deed? Why, the
                                        lady merely turned her head, gave him a <orig>won-</orig>

            <p>As an offset to this instance of courtesy and good-breeding
                                        lavished on a cow, let me give you, as a parting bon-bouche, another cow
                                        anecdote, where, as you will see, there was no gentle
                                        politeness wasted.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Dr. H—— was an eccentric old man,
                                        near-sighted of course,—all eccentric people
                                        are,—who lived in a small country town in this
                                        neighborhood. Numerous are the traditionary accounts of his
                                        peculiarities,—of his odd manners and
                                        customs,—which I have heard; but it is only of one
                                        little incident that I am now going to speak. A favorite
                                        employment of this good man was the care of his garden, and
                                        he might be seen any pleasant afternoon in summer, rigged
                                        out in a hideous yellow calico robe, or blouse, with a dusty
                                        old black straw hat stuck on the back of his head, hoeing
                                        and digging in that beloved patch of ground. One day as he
                                        was thus occupied, his wife emerged from the house, dressed
                                        in a dark brown gingham, and bearing in her hand some
                                        "muslins," which she began to spread upon the
                                        gooseberry-bushes to whiten. She was very<pb n="47"/> busily engaged, so that
                                        she was not aware that her husband was approaching her with
                                        a large stick, until she felt a smart blow across her
                                        shoulders, and heard his peculiar, sharp voice shouting in
                                        her ears, "Go 'long! old cow! Go 'long! old cow!"</p>

            <p>The slightest inclination of a standing body virtually narrows

                                        the firmest figure. Most characters are inconsistent,

            <p>Hoops and coins, which cannot preserve their equilibrium when in

            <p>DID you ever try to eat a peach elegantly and gracefully? Of
                                        course you have. Show me a man who has not tried the
                                        experiment, when under the restraint of human surveillance,
                                        and I shall look upon him as a curiosity. There is no fruit,
                                        certainly, which has so fair and alluring an exterior; but
                                        few content themselves with feasting their eyes upon it. How
                                        fresh and ripe it looks as it lies upon the plate, with its
                                        rosy cheek turned temptingly upward! How cool and soft is

                                        Ah, unhappy wight! Bitterly you shall repent your rashness.
                                        Any other fruit can be eaten with comparative ease and
                                        politeness; a peach was evidently intended<pb n="53"/> only to be looked at,

                                        the room, plate in hand, regarding your peach as if it were
                                        some great natural curiosity. A sudden jog of your elbow
                                        compels you to a succession of most dexterous balancings as
                                        your heavy peach rolls from side to side, knocks down your
                                        knife, and threatens to plunge after it when you stoop to
                                        regain it. You look distractedly round for a table, but all
                                        are occupied. Even the corner of the mantel-shelf holds a
                                        plate, and you enviously see the owner thereof leaning
                                        carelessly against the chimney, and looking placidly round
                                        upon his less fortunate companions. You glance at the
                                        different groups to see if any one else is in your most
                                        unenviable predicament. Ah, yes! Yonder stands a gentleman
                                        worse off yet, for, in addition to your perplexities, he is
                                        talking with a young, laughing girl, who is watching his
                                        movements, with a merry twinkle in her bright eyes. He
                                        evidently wishes to astonish her by his dexterity, and
                                        disappoint her roguish expectations. He holds his plate
                                        firmly in his left hand, and <orig>pro-</orig>
               <pb n="54"/> ceeds, at
                                        once, to cut his peach in halves. Deuce take the blunt
                                        silver knife! The tough skin resists its pressure. The knife
                                        and plate clash loudly together; the peach is bounding and
                                        rolling at the very feet of the young lady, who is in an
                                        ecstasy of laughter. Ah! she herself has no small
                                        resemblance to a peach, fair, beautiful, and attractive
                                        without, and, I sadly fear, with a hard heart beneath.</p>
            <p>Are you yet more miserable than before? Turn then to yonder
                                        sober-looking gentleman, who certainly seems sufficiently
                                        composed to perform the difficult manœuvre. He has
                                        the advantage of a table to be sure; but that is not every
                                        thing. He begins right, by deliberately removing the woolly
                                        skin. Now he lays the slippery peach in his plate, and makes
                                        a plunge at it with his knife. A sharp, prolonged screech
                                        across his plate salutes the ears of all the bystanders, and
                                        a fine slice of juicy pulp is flung unceremoniously into the
                                        face of the gentleman opposite, who certainly does not look
                                        very grateful for the unexpected gift.</p>
            <p>Every one, of course, has seen the awkward accident. O no! That
                                        pretty, animated girl upon the sofa is much too pleasantly
                                                engaged,<pb n="55"/> that
                                        is evident, to be watching her neighbors. Playing carelessly
                                        with her fan, and casting many sparkling glances upward at
                                        the two gentlemen who are vying with each other in their
                                        gallant attentions, she has enough to do without noticing
                                        other people. She is happily unconscious of the
                                        mortification which is in store for her, or wilfully shuts
                                        her eyes to the peril. Alas! Her hand is resting, even now,
                                        upon the destroyer of all her present enjoyment, the
                                        beautiful, fragrant, treacherous peach. With a nonchalance
                                        really shocking to the anxious beholder, she raises it, and
                                        breaks it open, talking the while, and scarcely bestowing a
                                        thought upon what she is about. Dexterously done;
                                        but— O luckless maiden!—the fruit is
                                        ripe, and rich, and juicy, and the running drops fall, not
                                        into her plate, but upon the delicate folds of her dress.</p>
            <p>The merry repartee dies away upon her lips, as she becomes
                                        conscious of the catastrophe. It is with a forced smile that
                                        she declares, "It is nothing; O, not of the slightest
                                        consequence!" That unlucky peach! How many blunders, how
                                        many pauses, how many absent-minded remarks it occasions!
                                        She makes the most frenzied<pb n="56"/>
                                        attempts to regain her former gayety, but in vain. Her
                                        gloves are stained and sticky with the flowing juice, and
                                        she is oppressed by the conviction that all her partners for
                                        the rest of the evening will hate her most heartily. An
                                        expression of real vexation steals over her pretty face, and
                                        she gives up her plate to one of the attendant beaux, with
                                        not so much as a wish that he will return to her. Where are
                                        the arch smiles, the lively tones, the quick and ready
                                        responses now? Her spirit is quenched. Her manner has become
                                        subdued, depressed,—shall I say it?
                                        —yes, even sulky.</p>
            <p>Ah! I see your courage will not brave laughter. You steal to the
                                        table, half ashamed of yourself as you set down your
                                        untasted peach. Your sudden zeal to relieve those ladies of
                                        their plates serves as a very good excuse for the
                                        relinquishment of your own. You have rescued yourself very
                                        well from your dilemma this time. Remember my advice for the
                                        future. Never accept a peach in company.</p>

            <head type="sub">A DARK NIGHT.</head>
            <p>THERE are some people who seem to have the faculty which horses
                                        and dogs are said to possess,—of seeing in the
                                        dark. But I, alas! am blind and blundering as a beetle; I
                                        never can find my way about house in the evening, without a
                                        lamp to illumine my path. Many smarting remembrances have I
                                        of bruised nose and black eyes, the consequences of
                                        attempting to run through a partition, under the full
                                        conviction that I have arrived at an open door. My most
                                        prominent feature has been rudely assailed, also, by doors
                                        standing ajar, unexpectedly, which I have embraced with both
                                        outstretched arms. Crickets, tables, chairs (especially
                                        chairs with very sharp rockers), and other movable articles
                                        of furniture, have <orig>sta-</orig>
               <pb n="58"/> tioned themselves, as
                                        it would seem, with malicious intent to trip me up. Some
                                        murderous contusion makes me suddenly conscious of their
                                        presence. Then a feeling of complete bewilderment and
                                        helplessness and timidity comes over me. I have not the
                                        least idea in what part of the room I am. I am oppressed
                                        with a sense of chairs, scattered about in improbable
                                        places. I long most ardently for a lamp, or only for one
                                        gleam from a neighbor's window. It is no rare thing for me
                                        to discover, by a thrilling touch upon the cold glass, that
                                        I have been feeling my way exactly in the opposite direction
                                        from what I imagined. Strange how ideas of direction and
                                        distance are lost when the sight is powerless!
                                        <emph>Touch</emph> may find out mistakes, but cannot always
                                        prevent them. Touch may convince me that I have arrived at
                                        my bureau, but it is too careless to perceive (what the
                                        poor, straining eyes would have discovered at a glance) the
                                        open upper drawer that salutes my forehead as I stoop
                                        hastily to grasp the handles beneath. Touch is clumsy. It
                                        only serves to upset valuable plants, inkstands, solar
                                        lamps, &amp;c., with an appalling crash, and then leaves
                                        me standing aghast, in utter uncertainty as to the extent of
                                        the catastrophe. In<pb n="59"/>
                                        such emergencies a rush for the stairs is the first impulse.
                                        Ah! but those stairs!</p>
            <p>I will pass over the startling plunge which begins my descent,
                                        the frantic snatch for the banisters, and the strange,
                                        momentary doubt as to which foot must move first, like what
                                        a child may feel when learning to walk. All this only serves
                                        to render me so over-careful, that, when I actually arrive
                                        at the foot of the staircase, I cannot believe it, until a
                                        loud scuff, and the shock that follows the interruption of
                                        my expected descent, assure me beyond a doubt. There is
                                        nothing more exasperating than this, unless it may be the
                                        corresponding disappointment in running up stairs, when you
                                        raise your foot high in air, and bring it down with an
                                        emphatic stamp exactly upon a level with the other.</p>
            <p>But these are mere household experiences. Sad though they are, I
                                        esteem them as nothing in comparison with my adventures out
                                        of doors. In a dark night, and especially in a night both
                                        dark and stormy, I feel myself one of the most wretched
                                        beings in existence. Imagine a vessel lost in the wide
                                        ocean, and without a compass, and you will have some faint
                                        idea of my perplexity, discouragement, and loneliness at<pb n="60"/> such a time. I have a
                                        strange propensity for shooting off into the gutter, or for
                                        shouldering the fences, under the impression that I am
                                        pursuing a straight course. I go quite out of my way to trip
                                        over chance stones, or to pick out choice bits of slippery
                                        ice. I splash recklessly through deep puddles, stumble over
                                        unfortunate scrapers, walk unexpectedly into open cellars,
                                        and lay my length upon wet stone doorsteps. I start back at
                                        visions of posts looming up in the darkness, and whitewashed
                                        fences and trees, all of which would be quite unlikely to be
                                        standing in the middle of the sidewalk, and which disappear
                                        at the first reasonable thought. I run into harmless
                                        passengers as if I would knock the breath of life out of
                                        them, and tangle our umbrellas together so fearfully that
                                        they spin round and round some time after their separation.
                                        O that umbrella of mine! Sometimes I hook it in the drooping
                                        branches of trees, and, losing my hold in the suddenness of
                                        the shock, have the gratification of feeling it tip up, and
                                        go down over my shoulder into the mud behind me. Its bone
                                        tips tap and scratch at the windows as I go by, and scrape
                                        against the tall fences, like fingers trying to catch at
                                        something to hold on<pb n="61"/>
                                        by, and stop my progress. It hits a low branch, and its
                                        varnished handle slips through my woollen gloves, knocking
                                        my hat over my eyes, and extinguishing me for the time
                                        being. As if the night were not dark enough without!</p>
            <p>My friends, I could go on much longer with my complaints, but I
                                        feel that I have drawn upon your sympathies sufficiently for
                                        the present. You will be as glad to leave me at my own
                                        house-door, as I am to find it.</p>

            <p>UNDER the general head of <emph>string</emph>, I might enumerate
                                        a long list of this world's miseries. Shoe-strings alone
                                        comprehend an amount of wretchedness, which is but feebly
                                        described in the tragical story of Jemmy String. Bonnet-
                                        strings and apron-strings, dickey-strings and watch-guards,
                                        curtain-cord, bed-cord, and cod- line, each and all have
                                        furnished enough discomfort to make out a long grumbling
                                        article. But I cannot linger to describe their treacherous
                                        desertions when their services are most needed, their
                                        unexpected weakness, and their obstinate entanglements when
                                        time presses. A certain pudding-bag string is commemorated
                                        in one of the beautiful couplets of Mother Goose's Melodies.
                                        I am sure you cannot have forgotten it,<pb n="63"/> nor the staring spotted
                                        cat that is there represented racing away with her booty.
                                        That lamented pudding-bag string is but a type of strings in
                                        general. They are fleeting possessions, always hiding,
                                        always misplaced, never in order. You fit up a
                                        string-drawer, perhaps, with a fine assortment, and pride
                                        yourself upon its nice arrangement. Go to it a week after,
                                        and see if you can find one ball where you left it! Can you
                                        lay your hand upon a single piece that you want? No, indeed!
                                        Twine is considered common property. If any one has a use
                                        for it, he takes it without leave or license, without even
                                        inquiring who is the owner, and you may be sure he will
                                        never bring any of it back again. O the misery endured for
                                        the want of an errant piece of twine, when you are in a
                                        nervous hurry to do up a parcel, some one waiting at the
                                        door meanwhile! After an immense deal of pains, you have it
                                        at last folded to your liking, with every corner squared and
                                        even, every wrinkle smoothed. Then, clasping tightly with
                                        one hand the stiff wrapper, you search distractedly with the
                                        other for a ball of twine, which you distinctly remember
                                        tossing into the paper-drawer only the day before. In vain
                                        you surround<pb n="64"/> yourself
                                        with newspaper and brown paper, and useless rubbish,
                                        tumbling your whole drawer into confusion. In vain you
                                        relinquish your nicely packed parcel, and see its contents
                                        scattered in all directions. In vain you grumble and scold.
                                        The ball is not forthcoming. Your little brother has seized
                                        it to fly his kite, or your sister is even now tying up her
                                        trailing morning-glories, or sweet peas, with the stolen
                                        booty. You plunge your hand exploringly into the drawer, and
                                        bring up a long roll wound thickly with twine of all kinds
                                        and colors. Your eyes sparkle at the prize; but, alas! the
                                        first energetic pull leaves in your hand a piece about four
                                        inches long, and a quantity of dangling ends and rough knots
                                        convince you that you have nothing to hope in that quarter.
                                        A second plunge brings up a handful of odds and ends, strong
                                        pieces clumsy and rough, coarse red quill-cord, delicate
                                        two-colored bits far too short, cotton twine breaking at a
                                        touch, fine long pieces hopelessly tangled together, so that
                                        not even an end is visible. The more you twitch at the
                                        loops, the more desperate is the snarl. Poor mortal! Your
                                        pride gives way before the urgency of haste. You send off
                                        your nice packet miserably tied together by two kinds of
                                        twine.</p>
            <pb n="65"/>
            <p>All the rest of the day you are tormented by a superfluity of the
                                        very thing you needed so much. It was impossible to get it
                                        when you wanted it; but now it is pertinaciously in your way
                                        when you do <emph>not</emph> want it. You almost break your
                                        neck tripping over a long, firm cord, which proves to be a
                                        pair of reins left hanging on a chair by some careless
                                        urchin. The carpet and furniture are strewed with long,
                                        straggling pieces of packthread. You find a white end
                                        dangling conspicuously from your waistcoat pocket. As you
                                        walk the streets you see twine flying from fences, or lying
                                        useless on the sidewalk, black with dust and age. To crown
                                        the whole, a friend comes with a piece of twine extending
                                        across two rooms, and asks you to help him twist and double
                                        it into a cord. It is a very entertaining process. You amuse
                                        yourself with watching one little rough place that whirls
                                        swiftly round, stops with a jerk, turns hesitatingly one
                                        side and the other, then, yielding to a new impulse, flies
                                        round and round again till you are dizzy. You look with
                                        great complacency at the tightening twist, now brought
                                                <emph>almost</emph> to perfection. You turn it
                                        carelessly in your fingers, scarcely noticing its convulsive
                                        starts for <orig>free-</orig>
               <pb n="66"/> dom. Ah! your
                                        imprudent friend, without any warning, gives it a final pull
                                        to stretch it into shape. The twine slips from your grasp,
                                        springs away across the room, curls itself into a succession
                                        of snarls and twisted loops, and then lies motionless. Your
                                        friend looks thunderstruck. With a hasty apology, you step
                                        forward and tightly clasp the recreant end. You are in
                                        nervous expectation of dropping it again. Your fingers are
                                        benumbed at the tips with their tight compression, and the
                                        constant twitching. They give a sudden jerk. You make an
                                        involuntary clutch for the cord, but in vain. It is rapidly
                                        untwisting at the very feet of your companion, who looks at
                                        it in despair. Again you make an attempt with no success at
                                        all, the refractory twine eluding your utmost endeavors to
                                        hold it. Once more! Your fellow-twister walks off at last,
                                        with a wretchedly rough affair, which he good humoredly says
                                        "will do very well."</p>

            <p>I BELIEVE the world has gone quite crazy on the subject of fresh
                                        air. In the next century people will think they must sleep
                                        on the house- tops, I suppose, or camp out in tents in
                                        primitive style. Nothing is talked about but ventilators,
                                        and air-tubes, and chimney-draughts. One would suppose that
                                        fire-places were invented expressly for cooling and airing a
                                        room, instead of heating it. There was no such fuss when I
                                        was young; in those good old times these airy notions had
                                        not come into fashion. Where the loose window-sashes rattled
                                        at every passing breeze, and the wind chased the smoke down
                                        the wide-mouthed chimney, nobody complained of being
                                        stifled. There were no furnaces then to spread a summer heat
                                        to every corner of the<pb n="68"/> house.
                                        No, indeed! We ran shivering through the long, windy
                                        entries, all wrapped in shawls, and hugging ourselves to
                                        retain the friendly warmth of the fire as long as possible.
                                        Far from devising ways of letting <emph>in</emph> the air,
                                        we tried hard to keep it <emph>out</emph> by stuffing the
                                        cracks with cotton, and closely curtaining the windows and
                                        bed. Even then, the ice in the wash-basin, and the
                                        electricity which made our hair literally stand on end in
                                        the process of combing, and the gradual transformation of
                                        fingers into thumbs, showed but too plainly that the wintry
                                        air had penetrated our defences. When we crowded joyfully
                                        round a crackling, sparkling wood-fire, even while our faces
                                        glowed with the intense heat, cold shivers were creeping
                                        down our backs, and sudden draughts from an opening door set
                                        our teeth chattering. I often wished myself on a spit, to
                                        revolve slowly before the fire until thoroughly roasted. Not
                                        from any want of air, I assure you, we children were always
                                        breaking panes of glass on the bitterest days, and the
                                        glazier was never known to come under a week to replace
                                        them. Why people should wish to revive, and live through
                                        again, the miseries of such a frost-nipped childhood, I
                                        cannot imagine.<pb n="69"/> I,
                                        for one, love a snug house, even a warm house. I am of a

                                        colds, &amp;c. Fresh air is my bane. I banish all books
                                        on the subject from my table. I studiously avoid all
                                        notorious fresh- air lovers, or try in every way to bring
                                        over the poor, misguided mortals to my views; but it is of
                                        no use. Fresh air is the fashion, and is run to extremes, as
                                        all fashions must be. I call in a physician; lo! <emph>fresh
                                                air</emph> is recommended as a tonic. I give a
                                        party; of course my windows are all thrown open, and foolish
                                        young girls, in the thinnest of white muslins, are standing
                                        in the draught; and such a whirlwind is raised by the
                                        flirting of fans, and the rush of the dancers, that I am
                                        blown, like a dry leaf, into a corner, where I stand
                                        shivering, and making rueful attempts to appear smiling and
                                        hospitable. I go out to pass a social afternoon with a
                                        friend, and am set down in a room just above the
                                        freezing-point, with a little crack opened in the window,
                                        and all the doors flying, to <emph>change the air</emph>. I
                                        ride in the omnibus, and am almost choked with my
                                        bonnet-strings, such a furious draught meets me in the face,
                                        and when, with infinite pains, I have secured the only
                                        tolerably warm corner, my next<pb n="70"/>
                                        neighbor becomes very faint, and must have the window open.
                                        Even the poor babies are not safe from this popular
                                        insanity. You may see the little victims any day, taking an
                                        airing, with their little red noses and watery eyes peeping
                                        forth from under the cap and feathers. The old- fashioned
                                        blanket, in which the baby was done up head and all, like a
                                        bundle, is thrown aside. The child is not quite so often
                                        carried upside down. I suppose, under the new system, but
                                        what difference does it make whether the poor thing is
                                        smothered or frozen to death?</p>
            <p>I never shall forget a long journey I took once with a friend who
                                        was raving mad on the subject of fresh air and cold water.
                                        Every morning the windows were thrown wide open, and the
                                        blinds flung back with an energetic bang, while a stiff
                                        wintry wind whirled every thing about the room, and flapped
                                        the curtains against the ceiling. And there she stood,
                                        declaring herself exhilarated, while her nose and lips
                                        turned from red to blue, and the tears ran down her cheeks.
                                        I always took to flight. Afterwards the poor auto-martyr
                                        went out to walk before breakfast, scornfully rejecting all
                                        offers of furs and extra wrappings. O dear, no!
                                        <emph>She</emph> never thought of<pb n="71"/> muffs, tippets, snow-boots, but as
                                        encumbrances fit for extreme old age and infirmity. She
                                        always walked fast, and the more the wind blew, the warmer
                                        she felt, I might be assured. As soon as she had gone, I
                                        established myself in comfort by the side of a glowing
                                        grate, happy but for dreading her return. She came in
                                        dreadfully fresh and breezy from the outer air, very
                                        energetic, very noisy, and fully bent upon stirring me up
                                        and making me take exercise. After snapping the door open
                                        and slamming it behind her with a clap that greatly
                                        disturbed my nerves, she exclaimed in a stentorian voice, "O
                                        dear me! I shall <emph>die</emph> in such an oven! My dear
                                        child, you have no idea how hot it is!" And the first thing
                                        I knew, up would go a window with a crash that made the
                                        weights rattle. It might rain or shine; weather made no
                                        difference to this inveterate air-seeker. Many a time has
                                        she come in all dripping, and tracking the carpet, brushed
                                        carelessly against me with her wet garments, and finally
                                        enveloped me with the steam arising from them as they hung
                                        around my fire. It roused my indignation that she should
                                        make herself and every body else so uncomfortable, and then
                                        glory in the deed as if it<pb n="72"/>
                                        were indubitably and indisputably praiseworthy. She was so
                                        good-natured, however, and so happy in her delusion, that I
                                        could not find it in my heart to remonstrate very
                                        vehemently, except when she would make me listen to her
                                        interminable lectures upon the importance, the
                                                <emph>necessity</emph>, of fresh air, and the effect
                                        of a snug, cosy room upon the blood, the heart, the lungs,
                                        the head, and (as I verily believe she hinted) <emph>the
                                                temper</emph>. I know I lost all control of
                                                <emph>mine</emph> long before she finished; but
                                        whether it was the want of fresh air in practice, or too
                                        much of it in theory, I leave you to imagine.</p>
            <p>My friend always carried a small thermometer in her trunk, which
                                        she consulted a dozen times an hour, in order to regulate
                                        the temperature of the room. Alas for me if the quicksilver
                                        rose above 60! I devoutly hoped she would leave it behind in
                                        some of our numerous stopping-places, and with an eye to
                                        that possibility, I must confess, I hung it in the most
                                        out-of-the-way corners I could find; but it seemed to be on
                                        her mind continually. She never forgot it, and always packed
                                        it very carefully, too. I asked her two or three times to
                                        let me put it in <emph>my</emph> trunk, where I had slyly
                                        arranged a nice little place full of<pb n="73"/> hard surfaces and sharp corners, but
                                        she always had plenty of room.</p>
            <p>I believe my zealous friend is now residing at the sea-shore,
                                        freezing in the cold sea-winds, and losing her breath every
                                        morning in the briny wave, under the strange illusion that
                                        she is improving her health.</p>

            <head>INNOCENT SURPRISES.</head>
            <p>I AM somewhat inclined to the opinion, that, if positive
                                        legislation could be brought to bear upon this subject,
                                        making it a criminal offence for one person deliberately to
                                        concoct and designedly to spring a surprise upon another,
                                        society would derive incalculable benefit from the act. For
                                        the ordinary and inevitable surprises of every-day life are
                                        sufficiently frequent and startling to content even the most
                                        romantic disposition; entirely dispensing with the necessity
                                        of those artfully contrived, embarrassing little plots which
                                        one's friends occasionally set in motion, greatly to their
                                        own diversion and the extreme discomfort of the surprised

                                        a desperately bad bill in exchange for good silver, or been
                                        caught in a thunderstorm with white pantaloons and no
                                        umbrella, knows that the unavoidable surprises of life are
                                        in themselves staggerers of quite frequent occurrence, and
                                        require not the aid of human invention. But the surprises
                                        which we most dread are not those which
                                        <emph>naturally</emph> fall to us as part of the misfortune
                                        we are born to inherit; not those which result from
                                        unforeseen accidental circumstances, from carelessness on
                                        our own part or from the folly of others, from revolutions
                                        in the elements or in the affairs of nations; these we
                                                <emph>can</emph> bear, by using against them the
                                        best remedies we possess, or by viewing and enduring them as
                                        wisdom and philosophy teach us to do. No; our only prayer,
                                        in this connection, is that we may be saved from our
                                        friends; not from their carelessness, but from their
                                        deliberate schemes against our security.</p>
            <p>In order to reconcile this apparent contradiction in terms, take
                                        the following instance of a friendly propensity. You walk
                                        into your house at dusky twilight, at that particular hour
                                        of evening at which your <emph>own brother</emph>, if he be

               <pb n="79"/> able being, would not
                                        expect you to recognize him; one of your family extends his
                                        (or her) head from the parlor, and calls upon you at once to
                                        enter, and greet "an old friend." You obey, and are
                                        immediately confronted with an individual whose countenance
                                        wears an expression associated with some reminiscences of
                                        your youth, but so dim and undefined is it, that you cannot,
                                        for the life of you, give it its appropriate name or place.
                                        What is to be done? The recollections of early childhood are
                                        expected spontaneously to burst forth from under a heap of
                                        later and more vivid associations, and the name, residence,
                                        business, and whole history of the unwelcome guest are
                                        called upon to suggest themselves within a second's time.</p>
            <p>After a long moment of painful hesitation, during which you have
                                        in vain tried to <emph>stare</emph> his name out of him, you
                                        clutch at a struggling idea, and blurt out the name of one
                                        of your former associates. You do this, not by any means
                                        because common sense or conviction suggest the course, but
                                        simply because something must instantly be done. The result,
                                        of course, is, that you hit upon the wrong name; and now
                                        your kind friends can do no more for you; even if<pb n="80"/> they rush to the
                                        rescue, and formally introduce the stranger, it is of no
                                        avail. The deed is done; you are placed in a position of
                                        awkward mortification, which both the stranger and yourself
                                        will never forget, and never cease to regret.</p>
            <p>Why it is that the feeling of shame which follows upon such
                                        mishaps attaches itself exclusively to the innocent
                                        sufferers, rather than to those who are the cause of the
                                        suffering, I never could understand. This kind of diversion
                                        betrays a want of humane consideration in the contriver. It
                                        is infinitely more cruel and unamiable than Spanish
                                        bull-baitings, or the gladiatorial shows of the ancients,
                                        inasmuch as a shock to the finest feelings of human nature
                                        is harder to bear, and longer in duration, than the
                                        momentary pang induced by witnessing a merely physical
                                        suffering.</p>

            <head>THE OLD SAILOR.</head>
            <p>IN my school vacations I used occasionally to visit an old sailor
                                        friend, a man of uncommon natural gifts, and that varied
                                        experience of life which does so much to supply the want of
                                        other means of education. He must have been a handsome man
                                        in his youth, and though time and hardship had done their
                                        utmost to make a ruin of his bold features, and had made it
                                        needful to braid his still jetty black locks together to
                                        cover his bald crown, his was a fine, striking head yet, to
                                        my boyish fancy. I loved to sit at his feet, and hear him
                                        tell the events of sixty years of toil and danger, suffering
                                        and well-earned joy, as he leaned with both hands upon his
                                        stout staff, his body swaying with the earnestness of his
                                        speech. His labors and perils were now ended, and in his age
                                        and infirmity he<pb n="82"/> had found
                                        a quiet haven. He had built a small house by the side of the
                                        home of his childhood, and his son, who followed his
                                        father's vocation, lived under the same roof. This son and
                                        two daughters were all that remained to him of a large
                                        family.</p>
            <p>"An easterly bank and a westerly glim are certain signs of a wet
                                        skin!" said the fisherman, pointing to the heavy black
                                        masses of cloud that hung over the eastern horizon, one
                                        morning when I had risen at sunrise for a day's fishing. "'T
                                        won't do; don't go out to-day! There's soon such a breeze
                                        off shore, as, with the heavy chop, would make you sick
                                        enough! Besides, the old dory won't put up with such a storm
                                        as is coming. No fishing, my boy, to-day."</p>
            <p>His old father said, "Stephen is right. There is a blow brewing."
                                        And he came to look, leaning on his cane. "Stay in to-day."</p>
            <p>I yielded, and the sky during the morning slowly assumed a dull,
                                        leaden hue. The storm came on in the afternoon, heavily
                                        pattering, and pouring, and blowing against the windows, and
                                        obscuring the little light of an autumn twilight. I wandered
                                        through the few small rooms of the cottage, endeavoring to
                                        amuse myself, while the<pb n="83"/> light lasted, with two funeral sermons and an old
                                        newspaper. Then I sat down at a window, and I well remember
                                        the gloomy landscape, seen through the rain, in the
                                        dusk:—the marsh, with the creek dividing it, the
                                        bare round eminence between the house and the beach, or
                                        rather the rocky cliffs, and on either side the wide, lonely
                                        sands, with heavy foam-capped breakers rolling in upon the
                                        shore, with a sound like a solemn dirge. At a distance on
                                        the left, half hidden by the walnut-trees, lay the ruins of
                                        a mill, which had always the air of being haunted. A high,
                                        rocky hill, very nearly perpendicular on the side next the
                                        house, was covered on the sides and top with junipers,
                                        pines, and other evergreens. As the darkness thickened, I
                                        left the lonely "best room" for the seat in the large
                                        chimney-corner, in the kitchen. The old wife tottered round,
                                        making preparations for the evening meal, and muttered
                                        recollections of shipwrecks which the storm brought to her
                                        mind. Now and then she would go to a window, turn back her
                                        cap-border from her forehead, put her face close to the
                                        glass, shading off the firelight with her hand, and gaze out
                                        into the darkness.</p>
            <p>"Asa did not go out either, thank the good<pb n="84"/> Father!" she said. The
                                        dog whined piteously. "St! St! Poor Scip! Here, shall have a
                                        piece! Good dog! A fearful night indeed it is."</p>
            <p>The two men came in from the barn, shook off the wet, and drew
                                        near the fire.</p>
            <p>"Just such a night, twenty-nine years ago come August, we ran
                                        afoul of Hatteras. You remember, old woman, how they
                                        frighted ye about me, don't ye?"</p>
            <p>Amidst such reminiscences we were called to supper. I remember
                                        being solemnly impressed when that old man, bent with
                                        hardship and the weight of years, clasped his hands
                                        reverently, and in rude terms, but full of meaning, asked a
                                        blessing upon their humble board. I remember the flickering
                                        light from the logs burning on the hearth, and how it
                                        showed, upon the faces of those who sat there, a strong
                                        feeling of the words in which rose an added petition in
                                        behalf of those on the mighty deep.</p>
            <p>Supper being ended, the old man took down the tobacco-board, and,
                                        when he had cut enough to fill his pipe, handed it to his
                                        son, who, having done the same, restored it to its nail in
                                        the chimney-corner. Then they smoked, and<pb n="85"/> talked of dangers
                                        braved and overcome, of pirates, and shipwrecks, and
                                        escapes, till I involuntarily drew closer into my corner,
                                        and looked over my shoulder. Suddenly the dog under the
                                        table gave a whining growl.</p>
            <p>"I never seed the like o' that dog," exclaimed the fisherman,
                                        turning to me. "I thought he was asleep. But if ever a foot
                                        comes nigh the house at night, he gives notice. Depend on
                                        it, there's some one coming."</p>
            <p>The door of the little entry opened, with a rush of the whistling
                                        wind, and a man stepped in. The dog half rose, and though he
                                        wagged his tail, in token that he knew the step to be that
                                        of a friend, he kept up a low whine. A young man, muffled to
                                        the eyes, and with the water dripping from his huge
                                        pea-jacket, opened the kitchen-door.</p>
            <p>"William Crosby, why, what brings you out in such a storm as
                                        this? Strip off your coat, and draw up to the fire, can't
                                        ye? Where are you bound, then, and the night as dark as a
                                        wolf's throat?"</p>
            <p>The young fisherman made no answer, unless by a motion of his
                                        hand. As he turned back the collar from his face, we saw by
                                        the waving<pb n="86"/> light
                                        that it was pale as death. The long wet locks already lay
                                        upon his cheeks, making them more ghastly as he struggled to
                                        speak. "O Stephen Lee, it's no time to be sitting by the
                                        fire, when old Asa Osborn is rolling in the waters. A man's
                                        drownded; and who's to get the body for the wife and the
                                        children—God pity them!—afore the ebb
                                        carries it out to sea?"</p>
            <p>The old man drew his hand across his forehead, and rose. I looked
                                        at him as he drew up his tall figure, and looked the young
                                        messenger full in the eye. In a low, deep whisper, he said,
                                        "Who, William, did ye say? You said a man's
                                        drownded,—but tell me the name again."</p>
            <p>"Yes, Gran'sir, I did say it. Old Uncle Ase Flemming, he and the
                                        minister went out a fishing in the morning. The minister got
                                        his boots off in the water, and after a long time he's swum
                                        ashore. But poor Uncle Ase——. Stephen,
                                        come along. His poor wife's gone down to the beach, now."</p>
            <p>They left the house, and I shut the door after them, and came
                                        back softly to my seat by the old man's knee.</p>
            <p>Once before I had seen him, when a heavy<pb n="87"/> sorrow fell upon him. It was on a
                                        beautiful summer's day, and the open window let in the cool
                                        breeze from the sea. He was sitting by it in his arm-chair,
                                        looking out upon the calm water, buried in thought. His
                                        favorite daughter had long been very low, and might sink
                                        away at any moment. The old dog was at his feet asleep. The
                                        clock ticked in the corner, and the sun was shining upon the
                                        floor. Some friends sat by in silence, with sorrowful
                                        countenances. His little grandchild came to his side, and
                                        said, "Mother says, tell Grandpa Aunt Lucy's gone home."</p>
            <p>The old man did not alter his position. For some time he sat in
                                        deep thought, looking out with unseeing gaze, and winding
                                        his thumbs, as before. Of five fair daughters, three had
                                        before died by the same disease, consumption. He had seen
                                        them slowly fade away, one by one, and had followed his
                                        children to the grave in the secluded burying-ground, where
                                        the green sod was now to be broken to receive the fourth.</p>
            <p>Rising slowly, he walked across the room, and, taking the
                                        well-worn family Bible, returned with it to his seat; and,
                                        as he turned the leaves, he<pb n="88"/>
                                        said in a low tone to himself, "There's only one left now!"
                                        Then he sat entirely silent, with his eyes fixed upon the
                                        sacred page. He did not utter one word of lamentation, he
                                        did not shed a tear, but as he turned his eye on me, in
                                        passing, its expression went to my heart. Stealing softly
                                        out, I left him to the silent Comforter whose blessing is on
                                        the mourner.</p>
            <p>Now the scene was changed. One was suddenly taken from his side
                                        who had been a companion from boyhood to old age. They had
                                        played and worked in company; together they had embarked on
                                        their first voyage, and their last; and they had settled
                                        down in close neighborhood in the evening of their days.
                                        Each had preserved the other's life in some moment of peril,
                                        but took small praise to himself for so simple an act of
                                        duty. Few words of fondness had ever passed between them.
                                        They had gone along the path of life, without perhaps being
                                        conscious of any peculiarly strong tie of friendship binding
                                        them together, till they were thus torn asunder. The death
                                        of a daughter, long and slowly wasting away before his eyes,
                                        could be calmly borne. But this blow was wholly unforeseen,
                                        and his chest heavily rose and fell, and<pb n="89"/> by the bright firelight
                                        I saw tears rolling over his weather-beaten cheeks. <quote>

            <p>The fury of the storm being abated, I resolved to follow Stephen
                                        down to the shore. He was not in sight, and I knew not what
                                        direction to take. It was a gloomy night, the transient
                                        glimpses of the moon between driving masses of clouds only
                                        making the scene more wild and appalling. I could see the
                                        tops of the tall trees bending under the fury of the blast,
                                        ere it came to sweep the beach. The heaving billows were
                                        covered with foam, far as the eye could reach, and, rising
                                        and tumbling, seemed striving with each other as they rolled
                                        on towards the sands. I had seen storms upon the ocean
                                        before, but never had it presented so awful and majestic an
                                        appearance. As the breakers struck upon the shore, and sent
                                        a huge mass of water upon the sands, their sullen roar
                                        mingled with the howling and rushing of the wind, and filled
                                        me with awe.</p>
            <pb n="90"/>
            <p>There were torches upon the beach, and as I drew near, I saw the
                                        fishermen run together to one point. The body had just been
                                        washed ashore, and lay stretched upon the sands. The head
                                        was bare, and long locks of white hair streamed down upon
                                        the shoulders. The heavy pea-jacket was off from one arm, as
                                        if he had endeavored to extricate himself from it in the
                                        water. The sinewy arms lay powerless and free from tension
                                        then, but they told me that, when they first drew him from
                                        the surf, both hands were grasping a broken oar with such
                                        strength that they were unable to loose his hold, till
                                        suddenly the muscles relaxed, and the arms fell upon the
                                        ground. They turned the body, and a little water ran from
                                        the mouth. Then, gently raising it upon their shoulders,
                                        they bore it home.</p>

            <head>LAUGHTER.</head>
            <p>IN some individuals the risibles lie so near the surface that you
                                        may tickle them with a feather. In others, they are so
                                        deeply imbedded in phlegm, or so protected by the crust of
                                        ill-humor, that a strong thrust and a keen weapon are
                                        required to reach them.</p>
            <p>A laugh is in itself a different thing in different individuals.
                                        Some persons laugh inwardly, unsocially, bitterly. It is a
                                        pure grimace on your part when you join in their merriment,
                                        unless you are superior to the fear of ridicule. On the
                                        other hand, there is a laugh of so contagious a nature, that
                                        you are irresistibly moved to sympathy while ignorant of the
                                        exciting cause, or out of the sphere of its influence. You
                                        will laugh loud and long, and afterwards confess<pb n="92"/> that you had not the
                                        least gleam of a funny idea, all the while.</p>
            <p>You doubt the power of the sympathetic laugh? Come with me into
                                        the nursery. Here is a rosy little horror, a year and a half
                                        old. Sit down and take him upon your knees. Hold his dimpled
                                        hands in yours, and look steadily into his roguish eyes.
                                        Repeat a nursery rhyme, no matter what, in a humdrum
                                        recitative; he is sober, and very attentive. Suddenly spring
                                        a mine upon him with a "Boo!" His "Hicketty- hick!" follows,
                                        and his eyes begin to shine. Repeat the experiment.
                                        "Hicketty-hick!" again, more heartily than at first, with
                                        the baby encore, "Adin!" The same process awakens the
                                        rapturous little pearls again and again, and you are quite
                                        in the spirit of the thing yourself. Now for a more ecstatic
                                        burst. You purposely prolong his suspense; he is all atilt,
                                        expecting the delightful surprise. You drawl out each word;
                                        you drone the ditty over and over again, till every tiny
                                        nerve is tense with expectation. "Boo!" at last, and over he
                                        goes, in the complete <emph>abandon</emph> of baby glee; his
                                        cherry lips are wide asunder, his head hangs powerless back,
                                        and the "Hicketty-hicks" burst tumultuously<pb n="93"/> from his little,
                                        beating throat. And <emph>you</emph>, sir; what are
                                                <emph>you</emph> doing? Laughing, I declare, in full
                                        roar, till the tears run down your cheeks. You catch the boy
                                        in your arms, toss him, almost throttle him with kisses, and
                                        so enhance the merry spasms, that mamma, who has a
                                        philosophical instinct with regard to excited nerves, and
                                        dreads the reaction, comes to the rescue.</p>
            <p>Let me introduce you to another effective laughter. You shall not
                                        hear a sound, yet you cannot choose but laugh, if she does,
                                        quiet as she is about it. See how her shoulders shake,
                                        —and look at her face! Every feature is instinct
                                        with mirth; the color mounts to the roots of the hair; the
                                        curls vibrate; the eyes sparkle through tears; the white
                                        teeth glisten; the very nose and ears seem to take a part;
                                        like Nourmahal, she "laughs all over," and while you wonder
                                        what the joke may be, you are laughing too.</p>
            <p>Do you feel dismal, or anxious? You should hear L. tell a story.
                                        She is one of the very few who can undertake with impunity
                                        to talk and laugh at the same time. Look and listen, while
                                        she describes some comic occurrence. There is no unladylike,
                                        boisterous noise, but musical<pb n="94"/>
                                        peals of laughter come thick and fast; and faster and
                                        thicker, preternaturally fast and thick, come the words with
                                        them. And yet each word is distinct; you do not lose a
                                        syllable. And I should like to see the man who can resist
                                        her, if she chooses he should laugh, even at his own
                                        expense.</p>
            <p>There is an odd sort of power, too, in the gravity with which B.
                                        tells a humorous anecdote. He invariably maintains a sober
                                        face while every body is in an agony of laughter around him.
                                        Just as it begins to subside, the echo of his own wit comes
                                        back to him, and, as if he had just caught the idea, he
                                        bursts into one little abrupt explosion, so genuine, so full
                                        of heartiness, that it sets every body off upon a fresh
                                        score.</p>
            <p>Nothing so melts away reserve among strangers, nothing so quickly
                                        develops the affinities in chance society, as laughter. A
                                        person might be ever so polite, and even kind, and talk
                                        sentiment a whole day, and it would not draw me so near to
                                        him as the mutual enjoyment of one heartfelt laugh. It is a
                                        perfect bond of union; for the time being, you have but one
                                        soul between you.</p>

            <head>THE OLD CHURCH.</head>
            <p>THERE are certain old-fashioned people who find fault with the
                                        luxuriousness of our churches, and ascribe to the warmth and
                                        comfort, which contrast so strongly with the hardships of
                                        early times, the acknowledged sleepiness of modern
                                        congregations. For my part, I see no necessary connection
                                        between discomfort and devotion. <emph>My</emph> soul, at
                                        least, sympathizes so much with its physical adjunct, that,
                                        when the latter is uncomfortable, the former is never quite
                                        free and active.</p>
            <p>Let me call to remembrance the church my childhood knew, with its
                                        capacious square pews, in which half the audience turned
                                        their backs upon the minister; the seats made to rise and
                                        fall, for the convenience of standing, and which closed
                                        every prayer with a clap of thunder; its<pb n="99"/> many aisles, like
                                        streets and lanes; the old men's seats, and the queer but
                                        venerable figures that were seen in them,—some
                                        with black-silk caps to protect their bald heads from the
                                        freezing draughts of air from the porchless doors; the old
                                        women's seats, on the opposite side; the elevated row of
                                        pews round the sides of the church, and the envied position
                                        of certain little children who had an extensive prospect
                                        through the open pew-top within doors, and a view of the
                                        hay-scales and the town-pump through the window besides.
                                        Those windows, in a double row, with the gallery
                                        between,—how regularly I counted the small panes,
                                        always forgetting the number, to make the same weary task
                                        necessary every Sunday! The singing-seats, projecting from
                                        the central portion of the gallery, furnished me with
                                        another hebdomadal study, in large gilt letters of antique
                                        awkwardness, which so impressed themselves on my mind that I
                                        see them now. This was the golden legend: "BUILT, 1770.
                                        ENLARGED, 1795." I remember hearing a wag propose to add as
                                        another remarkable fact, "SCOURED, 1818."</p>
            <p>Opposite to the singing-seats towered the pulpit, from which the
                                        clergyman looked down<pb n="100"/> upon us
                                        like a sparrow upon the house-top. He seemed in perpetual
                                        danger of being extinguished by a huge sounding-board. Very
                                        earnestly I used to gaze at the slender point by which it
                                        hung suspended, and wished, if it <emph>must</emph> come
                                        down, that I might make the gilt ornament at the apex,
                                        resembling a vase turned upside down, my prize. Under the
                                        pulpit was a closet, which some one veraciously assured me
                                        was the place where the tithingman imprisoned incautiously
                                        playful urchins. The terrors of that dark, mysterious cell
                                        had little effect on my conduct, however, as I was not
                                        entirely convinced of the existence of any such lynx-eyed
                                        functionary.</p>
            <p>The largest church in the county, it was, however, well filled,
                                        many of the congregation coming five and some even six
                                        miles, and remaining there through the noon intermission,
                                        which, on their account, was made as short as possible. But
                                        in winter the vast airy space had a peculiar and searching
                                        chill. No barn could be colder, except that the numerous
                                        footstoves made some little change in the air during
                                        service. The minister stood upon a heated slab of
                                        soap-stone. I used to watch this in its progress up the
                                        broad aisle and the pulpit stairs, under the arm of the<pb n="101"/> boy from the
                                        parsonage, and the irreverent way in which he made his
                                        descent, in view of the assembly, after depositing his
                                        burden, was thus rebuked by an old lady who was always droll
                                        and quaint. "Why, Matthew, when you come down the pulpit
                                        stairs of a Sunday, you throw up your heels like a horse
                                        coming out of a stable-door."</p>
            <p>Older grew the church, and colder; and if people then staid at
                                        home on Sunday afternoons, they had a better excuse for
                                        doing so than their successors can muster. The chorister,
                                        even, was frequently among the missing, but was charitably
                                        supposed to be subject to the ague. Efforts were made to
                                        prevail upon the elderly part of the parish to permit the
                                        introduction of stoves with long funnels. They scorned the
                                        enervating luxury! Their fathers had worshipped in the cold,
                                        and their sons might. But ah! how degenerate were the
                                        descendants of the noble old Puritan church-goers! The
                                        services curtailed to half their proper length, yet finding
                                        the patience of the listeners all too short! The degenerate
                                        descendants carried the day, however, the most bigoted of
                                        their opposers becoming disabled by rheumatism. The old

                                        resignation to inevitable evils being a lesson he had had
                                        much opportunity to learn, submitted with a good grace,
                                        though very much of opinion that fires in a church were an
                                        absurdity and a waste. The stoves were provided, and an
                                        uncommonly full attendance the next Sabbath showed the very
                                        general interest the matter had excited. How would it seem?
                                        Would any one faint?</p>
            <p>There was by no means a superabundance of heat; there was
                                        something wrong, but the lack of warmth was a hundred-fold
                                        made up in smoke. No one could see across the church, and
                                        the minister loomed up, as if in a dense fog; all eyes were
                                        fountains of tears. At last the old sexton went with a slow
                                        and subdued step up to the pulpit, and, wiping his eyes,
                                        respectfully inquired, in a whisper, whether there was not a
                                                <emph>little</emph> too much smoke. This suggestion
                                        being very smilingly assented to, he proceeded to extinguish
                                        the fires, and for that day the services were not indebted
                                        to artificial warmth to promote their effect.</p>
            <p>How sad are improvements in places to which our childish
                                        recollections cling! The gushing fulness of unchilled love
                                        is lavished even on <orig>in-</orig>
               <pb n="103"/> animate and
                                        senseless things, in a happy childhood. How was my heart
                                        grieved when the old-fashioned meeting-house was converted
                                        into the modern temple! Time and decay had rendered the tall
                                        spire unsafe, yet its fall by force and premeditated purpose
                                        seemed a sacrilege. I felt affronted for the huge
                                        weathercock, reclining sulkily against a fence, no more to
                                        point his beak to the east with obstinate preference. I
                                        mourned over the broad, old-fashioned dial, on which young
                                        eyes could discern the time a mile off. The old sexton lived
                                        to see this change, and at the end of half a century of care
                                        under that venerable roof he went to his rest. The beloved
                                        minister, and many, many who sat with trustful and devoted
                                        hearts under his teachings, are gone to their reward. A
                                        board from the old pulpit, a piece of the red-damask
                                        curtain, and the long wished-for gold vase, are now in my
                                        possession.</p>

            <head>A TALE</head>
            <head type="sub">FOUND IN THE REPOSITORIES OF THE ABBOTS OF THE
                                        MIDDLE AGES.</head>
            <p>SWEPT from his saddle by a low branch, Count Robert lay stunned
                                        upon the ground. The hunting-party swept on, the riderless
                                        steed galloping wildly among them. No man turned back; not
                                        one loved the Count better than his sport.</p>
            <p>There came to the spot a man in a woodman's garb, yet of a
                                        knightly and noble aspect. He bent over the fallen man, and
                                        bathed his temples, turning back the heavy, clustering
                                        locks. The Count, opening his eyes, gazed on him at first
                                        without surprise; he thought himself at home, however he
                                        came there, so familiar was the face.</p>
            <p>Then did the woodman embrace him with<pb n="107"/> tears, crying, "My brother, O my
                                        brother! it is I! it is Richard!"</p>
            <p>"Thou in England!" cried the Count. "Art thou mad?" And he
                                        frowned gloomily.</p>
            <p>"Fear not for me," replied the exile, tenderly raising the Count
                                        from the ground.</p>
            <p>A narrow path wound through the wood to a ruined hermitage. The
                                        outlaw here prepared a bed of leaves for the Count, laid him
                                        softly thereon, and went to seek some refreshment. His loved
                                        brother might revive, and yet smile kindly on the playmate
                                        of his youth, though under a ban.</p>
            <p>When Richard returned, there followed him like a dog a horse of
                                        the North-country breed, shaggy, and in size not much
                                        greater than a stag-hound. Robert viewed him with surprise,
                                        and it seemed with derision.</p>
            <p>"Despise not him who is able to bear thee out of the wood," said
                                        Richard. "Thou art faint; here is wine, and of no mean
                                        vintage."</p>
            <p>Robert drank from the earthen bottle, and his eye grew brighter,
                                        yet looked it not the more lovingly on Richard. He ate right
                                        gladly of the store of the landless and
                                        penniless,—dried venison and oaten
                                        bread,—and was refreshed, yet thanked him not.
                                        Richard gave fragments to<pb n="108"/> the neighing steed. He ate no morsel himself, nor tasted
                                        the wine. His heart was full to bursting.</p>
            <p>"Tell me of home,—of—of our father," he said,
                                        at last, with deep, strong sobs.</p>
            <p>"On the morrow, on the morrow," said Robert, disposing himself
                                        for sleep. "Thou wilt hear soon enough."</p>
            <p>But Richard seized him wildly by the shoulder, and bade him tell
                                        the worst.</p>
            <p>"Nay, then, if thou <emph>wilt</emph> know, he is dead. I, thy
                                        younger brother, am now thy superior."</p>
            <p>"For that I care not. As well thou, as I, to sit in my father's
                                        seat. But oh! left he no blessing for me? Did he not at the
                                        last believe me the victim of calumny?—Alas! No
                                        word? Not one dying thought of Richard?"</p>
            <p>"He died suddenly."</p>
            <p>Richard wept long and bitterly, and when, with faltering tongue,
                                        he asked tidings of his betrothed, his face was covered; he
                                        saw not the guilty flush upon his brother's brow, for that
                                        he had spread a lying report of the exile's death.</p>
            <p>"Would Bertha still brave the king's displeasure? Was she yet
                                        true to the unfortunate?"</p>
            <p>"Bertha is a very woman. She hath <orig>forgot-</orig>
               <pb n="109"/> ten the absent lover, and chosen
                                        another, and a better man."</p>
            <p>"Who, who hath supplanted me?" cried Richard fiercely, and
                                        springing upon his feet.</p>
            <p>"I tell thee not, lest thou wreak on him thy spite against thy
                                        faithless fair."</p>
            <p>"Know that Bertha's choice, though a traitor, is safe from me,
                                        even were I, as I was, a man to meet a knight on equal
                                        terms."</p>
            <p>His generous heart could not dream of fraternal treachery. And
                                        when his rival saw this, and that he suspected him not as
                                        yet, he smiled to himself, turned his face to the wall, and
                                        closed his eyes, if so be he might cut off further question.
                                        Soon, falling into slumber, he clenched his hands, and
                                        ground his teeth. The sleep of a traitor is ever haunted by
                                        uneasy dreams, and dark shadows of coming doom fell upon his
                                        spirit.</p>
            <p>Richard watched till dawn. Sometimes he started up to walk to and
                                        fro, beating his bosom, and wringing his hands in agony.
                                        Anon he threw himself prostrate in the stupor of despair. At
                                        the first carol of birds in the forest, sleep surprised his
                                        weary senses, and the peace of the innocent settled upon his
                                        features.</p>
            <pb n="110"/>
            <p>Side by side lay the brothers, alike in form, alike even in
                                        feature. But in heart they bore no mark of the resemblance
                                        of kindred. Envy of the elder-born early possessed the soul
                                        of Robert, like a base fiend; first had it driven thence
                                        love, and lastly honor.</p>
            <p>Does no one seek for the absent lord of the castle, while the
                                        weary hunters return to be his guests? Keeps no one anxious
                                        vigil, the live-long night? The unloving is not loved. But
                                        he hath a king beneath his roof; a king and lords of high
                                        degree sit at the morning board, and shall none but vassals
                                        be hospitably proud and busy?</p>
            <p>Ladies of rank were there, and among them, pale and silent, sat
                                        Bertha, looking on the king, it seemed, with an upbraiding
                                        eye. An angry gloom sat upon his grimly compressed lips, and
                                        sadness was upon his brow; for kingly power was naught,
                                        since remorse could not undo a wrong done to one who no
                                        longer lived, and vengeance could not reach its absent
                                        object. Richard's innocence had come to light, and Robert,
                                        albeit he knew it not, was now the dishonored outlaw.</p>
            <p>Ere the clock of the distant minster rung the hour of ten, the
                                        royal cavalcade wound from the<pb n="111"/> gates of the castle. At the same
                                        hour Count Robert awoke, and saw that the sun was already
                                        very high. It shone upon the calm face of Richard, tempered
                                        with quivering shadows from the leafy canopy above.</p>
            <p>"Up, brother Richard!" cried the Count; "thou wast ever a
                                        sluggard." And Richard, at his bidding, filled his
                                        hunting-pouch with provisions for the way, and went before,
                                        leading the little Northern nag, which the Count bestrode.
                                        He bore himself bravely under the weight of a rider whose
                                        feet nearly grazed the turf on each side.</p>
            <p>Slowly they wound through the tangled wood. "Stay, I will lighten
                                        thy burden for thee," said Robert, "if thou hast not left
                                        the bottle behind. Here's to the fair Bertha. What, thou
                                        wilt not drink? Then thou hast resigned her;—she
                                        is not worth a thought. Thou wilt not peril thy life to see
                                        her again, the false one who careth not for thee. Now
                                        depart, and when the king's wrath is overpast, I will
                                        beseech him for thee. Leave thy cause in a brother's hands."
                                        But Richard went not back, though, when they came to the
                                        edge of the wood, they beheld the king's train advancing in
                                        the broad highway.</p>
            <p>"Fly, Richard; escape while thou mayest!"<pb n="112"/> cried Robert, yet
                                        offered he not the horse for the greater speed. "Found on
                                        English ground, thou diest a felon's death. Disgrace not thy
                                        family. Carest thou not for life?" he cried, pursuing
                                        Richard, who stinted not, nor stayed, at the sight of the
                                        king, but the rather hasted forward.</p>
            <p>"What is life to me?" said Richard. "Let the king do with me as
                                        he will." He strode onward proudly, with folded arms,
                                        offering himself to the view of Edward, who as yet saw him
                                        not, or only as a forester.</p>
            <p>"Halt at least that I may spur on and implore for thee," said
                                        Robert, for he hoped that he might deliver him a prisoner to
                                        some one in attendance, that he should not come to speech of
                                        the king.</p>
            <p>With this wily purpose, he galloped forward. A shout arose, "The
                                        traitor! The traitor!" He was made prisoner by no gentle
                                        hands, and, at a nod from the king, found himself led away
                                        to the rear, but not far removed.</p>
            <p>He looked about for Richard. Could he not yet wave him back?
                                        Should the king see that noble face, he must be moved to
                                        mercy, at least so far as to give him audience. The
                                                brothers<pb n="113"/>
                                        know not yet that all is reversed. Robert sees a man in
                                        russet clothing kneel at the king's stirrup; he sees the
                                        royal hand extended to raise him; he sees many press forward
                                        eager to welcome the wanderer. He turns away, sick at the
                                        sight.</p>
            <p>One look more. Bertha has thrown herself into the arms of his
                                        hated brother. He tears his beard; he curses his own natal
                                        day, and the stars that presided over his birth and destiny.</p>
            <p>Yet must he look once more, though to an envious soul the sight
                                        of a brother's happiness is like the torment of purgatorial
                                        fire. Richard is standing with his hand extended towards
                                        him. He is pleading the cause of the mean and cowardly enemy
                                        who betrayed him. He pities and forgives him; he even loves
                                        him still, for is he not his brother? As the eyes of the
                                        king and of all the surrounding crowd are turned on him,
                                        burning shame subdues the warring passions that fill the
                                        heart of Robert, and a faint emotion of gratitude brings a
                                        tear to fall upon his hot cheek. Something of old, childish
                                        love awakes in his bosom, like dew in a dry land.</p>
            <p>The king granted Richard's prayer, the more<pb n="114"/> readily because his
                                        anger was smothered by contempt. The title and inheritance
                                        returned to the heir, who was worthy his ancient name.
                                        Robert, to the day of his death, lived on his brother's
                                        bounty, harmless, the rather that the king's decree had gone
                                        forth that in no case should he be Richard's successor, or
                                        inherit aught from him.</p>

            <p>NOTE.—Here ends the tale, but by patient research we
                                        have discovered one verse of an ancient ballad, supposed to
                                        have the same tradition for its subject. It is preserved in
                                        a curious collection of fragmentary poetry, to be found in
                                        most private libraries, and, in its more ancient and
                                        valuable editions, in the repositories of antiquaries. It
                                        stands, in the modern copy which we possess, as

                                        gentleman." Yes, we all know <name>Deformed</name>. When any
                                        of his family come to us, from England or France or any
                                        foreign country, we recognize the hideous brotherhood, and
                                        extend our welcoming hands; but <name>Graceful</name> must
                                        stay with us a long time to be greeted kindly, and her
                                        sisters from foreign parts are coldly looked upon, or
                                        dismissed at once.</p>
            <p>To begin at the top,—"the very head and front of the
                                        offending." A gentleman goes into<pb n="120"/> a fashionable
                                        hatter's, and the shopman, holding up for admiration a hat
                                        with a crown a foot high, of the genuine stove-pipe form,
                                        and a brim an inch wide, says, "This is the newest style,
                                        Sir." The gentleman walks home with the ugly thing on his
                                        head, but no one stares or laughs. 'Tis a new fashion, but
                                        all "take it easy." A year later, perhaps, the hatter shows
                                        him a thing with a brim a half an inch wider, but rolled up
                                        at the sides, and a crown of a much greater diameter at the
                                        top than where it joins the brim, —a specimen of
                                        the bell-crown. This is solemnly donned, and the wearer has
                                        the pleasure of knowing that the head-gear of all his
                                        friends is as hideous as his own. The inverted cone is worn
                                        with a sweet, Malvolio smile. And so "Deformed" has ruled
                                        the head of man for as many years as any of us can number,
                                        only ringing the changes, from one year to another, upon the
                                        three degrees of comparison of the word <emph>ugly</emph>.</p>
            <p>But a change takes place; a light, graceful, low-crowned hat,
                                        with a brim wide enough for shelter or for shade, begins to
                                        appear as a fashion;—and how is it received? The
                                        clergyman thinks it would be very unclerical for him to<pb n="121"/> wear it, though
                                        it may be as black, and is as modest, as the rest of his
                                        apparel. The young doctor timidly tries it on, and in his
                                        first walk meets the wealthy hypochondriac, his favorite
                                        patient, and the one who is trying to introduce him to
                                        practice, who seriously advises him, as a friend, not to
                                        wear that new-fangled thing,—if the poor hat had
                                        only been ugly, there would have been nothing bad in its
                                                <emph>new-fangled</emph> quality,—as all
                                        his respectable patients will leave him if he dresses so
                                        like a fool. The young lawyer gets one, because he heard an
                                        old lady speak of "those impudent-looking hats," and he is
                                        in hopes that impudence, which he understands is
                                        all-important in his profession, and which he is conscious
                                        of not possessing, may come with the hat. A lady goes out
                                        with her son, who is just old enough to have gained a coat,
                                        and is looking for his first hat. The mother has taste and
                                        judgment, and the youth has yet some unperverted affinity
                                        with graceful forms left, and so they choose and buy one of
                                        these comfortable and elegant chapeaux. Just before they
                                        reach home, they meet one of their best friends, a person
                                        whom the lady regards most kindly, and the young man admires
                                        and respects, and <emph>he</emph> greets<pb n="122"/> him with, "Why, Tom!
                                        have <emph>you</emph> got one of those rowdy hats?" And so
                                        the stiff, stove-pipe monstrosity keeps its place, and the
                                        only pleasant, sensible, graceful, becoming hat that the
                                        nineteenth century has known, is called all sorts of bad
                                        names, and quiet gentlemen are afraid to wear it.</p>
            <p>Has it not been the fate of the shawl, too, the most simple and
                                        elegant wrapper, and comfortable withal, that a man can
                                        throw around him, to be scouted and flouted?</p>
            <p>Yes, Deformed! Come on next winter with a white surtout in your
                                        hand that must fit so tightly that your victims can but just
                                        screw themselves into it, with a stiff, square collar
                                        touching the ears, and seven capes, one over the other,
                                        "small by degrees and beautifully less," and all respectable
                                        gentlemen will accept it, and virtuously frown down, as
                                        dandies or rowdies, those who will not sacrifice their
                                        shawls to the ugly idol.</p>

            <head>A GROWL.</head>
            <p>I KNOW it is generally considered decidedly boorish to utter
                                        complaints against the ladies. But I am for the present a
                                        bachelor, and in that capacity claim freedom of speech as my
                                        peculiar privilege. In virtue of my unhappy position, then,
                                        I proceed to utter the first of a series of savage growls,
                                        wishing the ladies to understand me as fully in earnest in
                                        this; that when I growl <emph>loud</emph>, I must be
                                        supposed to <emph>mean</emph> what I growl.</p>
            <p>For a month past, single gentlemen of every description have
                                        suffered in common with other fancy stocks, and have
                                        remained hopelessly below par. Those nice, trim, poetical,
                                        and polite young beaux, who, when no great undertaking
                                        agitates the female mind, are treated with kindness, and
                                        sometimes with distinction, by young ladies of discretion,
                                        are now, as it were, <orig>ruthless-</orig>
               <pb n="124"/> ly thrust and bolted out of the pale of feminine society
                                        by an awful demon who reigns supreme, —the Genius
                                        of Dress-making. The other evening, I pulled sixteen
                                        different bell-handles, in a gentlemanly manner, without
                                        obtaining admission into any house for the purpose of making
                                        a call; and when I succeeded in making an entrance at the
                                        seventeenth door by falsely representing myself as the agent
                                        of a dry-goods dealer, with a large box of patterns under my
                                        arm, I found the ladies in close conference with three
                                        dress-makers, studying a fashion-plate with an assiduity
                                        worthy of a better cause. A friend of mine, who has hitherto
                                        enjoyed the privilege of dining every day with six ladies,
                                        and has derived from their society great pleasure and
                                        profit, informed me yesterday, with a tear in each eye, that
                                        he had left the house for ever, the conversation being
                                        always turned upon topics with which he is utterly
                                        unacquainted, and conducted in a language which is about as
                                        intelligible to him as the most abstruse Japanese or the
                                        most classic Law-Latin.</p>
            <p>If we are so fortunate as to obtain, by any stratagem, admission
                                        to hall or anteroom, in the mansions of our fair friends,
                                        our olfactories are<pb n="125"/>
                                        regaled with a fragrance which we instinctively associate
                                        with tailors' shops, and which, I am informed, does in fact
                                        arise from the contact of woollen substances with hot
                                        flat-irons. As we advance, our ears are greeted by the
                                        resounding clash of scissors. Entering upon the field of
                                        action, our eyes are dazzled by a thousand fragments of rich
                                        and brilliant hues, and our personal safety endangered by
                                        swiftly flying needles and unsuspected pins. Gossip is at an
                                        end, for the thread must be continually bitten off. Dancing
                                        is child's play, a folly of the past. The piano is converted
                                        into a table, or an ironing-board. No games can be suggested
                                        but Thread-my-needle, and Thimble-rig. No books are at hand
                                        but Harper, with the fashion-plate at the end; the
                                        newspapers of the day are cut into uncouth shapes; and
                                        conversation (when conducted in English) hangs the
                                        unsuccessful Bloomer reform upon the gibbet of ridicule.</p>
            <p>Now, if we would prevent utter disunion in society, something
                                        like a compromise must be effected, and to the ladies
                                        belongs the laboring oar. I use a metaphor which implies
                                        that they must do something they are little accustomed to
                                        do; they must make some concession. We<pb n="126"/> have done all we
                                        could do, and I will make one statement which will convince
                                        the world that we bachelors are not obstinate without good
                                        reason. I confess (though it is not without some slight
                                        degree of shame that I own it), that I have, during the last
                                        week, consumed the greater part of every day in ineffectual
                                        study, trying to perfect myself in the terminology of the
                                        science of Fashion. I have listened attentively, and have
                                        gathered into a retentive memory sundry technicalities; but
                                        in vain have I submitted these terms of a strange dialect to
                                        the strictest etymological research. In vain have I
                                        conversed upon this subject with the most intelligent
                                        dry-goods dealers. In learning the few idiomatic phrases
                                        they employ, I have experienced only the satisfaction which
                                        young students in Greek literature feel, when they have,
                                        with infinite labor, mastered the <emph>alphabet</emph> of
                                        that rich and copious language.</p>
            <p>But there is hope. Experience tells us, this state of things
                                        cannot last for ever. A few weeks, and our sufferings shall
                                        be rewarded, our forbearance repaid. Then shall gay

                                        with the brilliant throng, and our sidewalks be swept once
                                        more by the gracefully flowing silk. Taper fingers shall
                                        condescendingly be extended to us, the smile of beauty beam
                                        on us, and witty speech banish our resentful remembrance of
                                        incomprehensible jargon.</p>

            <head>MY HERBARIUM.</head>
            <p>POOR, dry, musty flowers! Who would believe you ever danced in
                                        the wind, drank in the evening dews, and spread sweet
                                        fragrance on the air? A touch now breaks your brittle
                                        leaves. Your odors are like attic herbs, or green tea, or
                                        mouldy books. Your forms are bent and flattened into every
                                        ugly and distorted shape. Your lovely colors are
                                        faded,—white changed to black, yellow to dirty
                                        white, gorgeous scarlet to brick color, purple to muddy
                                        brown. Poor things! Who drew you from your native woods and
                                        brooks, to press you flat, and dry your moisture up, and
                                        paste you down helplessly upon your backs, such mocking
                                        shadows of your former grace and beauty?</p>
            <p>Ah! sorrowfully do I confess it! It was I. In my early years I
                                        searched the woods and<pb n="131"/> meadows, scaled rocks, forded bogs, and scrutinized each
                                        shady thicket, with murderous intent. I bore my drooping
                                        victims home, and sacrificed them relentlessly to science.
                                        With my own hand I turned the screw that crushed out all
                                        that was lovely and graceful and delicate about them. How I
                                        wearied myself over that flower-press! How anxiously I
                                        watched over the stiff stalks and shrivelled
                                        leaves,—all that was left! How perseveringly I
                                        changed and dried the papers, jammed my fingers between the
                                        heavy boards, and blistered my hands with that obstinate
                                        screw! And how cordially I hated it all! I liked the fun of
                                        gathering the flowers, the triumph of finding new specimens,
                                        and the excitement of hazardous scrambles; but as for the
                                        rest it was drudgery, which I went through only from a stern
                                        sense of duty. Now, thanks to the busy little fingers that
                                        passed over these leaves, I have a fund of amusement laid up
                                        for me; for every page has its story, and each mutilated
                                        flower is the centre of a beautiful picture. Here the
                                        ludicrous and the pathetic are so exquisitely blended, that
                                        I laugh with a regretful feeling at my heart, and sigh even
                                        when smiles are on my face. The first few pages are<pb n="132"/> light and joyous,
                                        full of a child's warm impulses and ready zeal, and
                                        enlivened here and there by some roguish caprice. That was
                                        the time when, in my simplicity, I loved dandelions and
                                        buttercups, and could see beauty even in the common
                                        white-weed of the fields. Ah! here they are, arranged in
                                        whimsical positions,—Clover and Sorrel, Violets
                                        and Blue-eyed Grass, Peppergrass and Dock (O, how hard that
                                        was to press!), Mouse-Ear and Yarrow, Shepherd's Purse,
                                        Buttercups, and full-blown Dandelion, Succory, and
                                        Chickweed, and Gill-run-over-the- ground,—with
                                        their homeliest names written in sprawling characters, all
                                        down hill, beneath them. I did not aspire to botanical names
                                        in those days. I thought nothing was unfit for my new
                                        Herbarium. Such was my zeal, that I believe I should have
                                        filled it entirely in a few days, if I had not been
                                        counselled to make a judicious selection. I had a faculty
                                        for bringing home plants impossible to press, and insisting
                                        upon making the experiment. I slept for a week with my
                                        bed-post tilted up on a huge book, wherein reposed a
                                        water-lily, obstinately refusing to lie flat. All kinds of
                                        woody plants, too, were my delight, though they invariably
                                        came out of<pb n="133"/> the
                                        press as they went in, except that the leaves were in every
                                        variety of unnatural position. I never grew weary, either,
                                        of gathering stately and graceful green ferns, and finding
                                        them all "cockled up," as the phrase went, when I got home.
                                        I believe I made some experiments on a horsechestnut blossom
                                        once; but as it is not to be found in my Herbarium, I am
                                        inclined to think they were unsuccessful. How happy children
                                        are with any new possession! I thought there never was any
                                        thing quite equal to my new book. All the girls had them,
                                        with neat marbled covers, and white paper within, and each
                                        one was determined to make hers the best of the whole. When
                                        pasting day came, there was an intense excitement. We all
                                        daubed our little fingers to our heart's content, and our
                                        faces too, as to that. I remember perfectly the sensation of
                                        smiling, after the paste stiffened. We spattered our desks,
                                        and pasted the wrong side of the flowers, and stuck the
                                        leaves together, and got every thing a little one-sided,
                                        and, in short, became so worried and heated and vexed, that
                                        we did not hunt for any more flowers for a long time after
                                        the first pasting day.</p>
            <p>In the mean while my ideas had undergone a<pb n="134"/> change. I had become
                                        much more ambitious. A hew page brings flowers of a higher
                                        order, and, beneath them, besides the common name, appears a
                                        sounding botanical title; ay, still more, the class and
                                        order are written in full. Poor things! How many of your
                                        species must have been pulled to pieces by inexperienced
                                        hands, to ascertain the exact number of stamens, and their
                                        relative positions! I feel, now, a tenderness for the
                                        shrinking, delicate wild flowers, that makes me hesitate
                                        even to pick them from their shady retreats; but
                                        <emph>then</emph>, such was my ardor for investigation, the
                                        more I loved them, and the more beautiful they seemed, the
                                        more eagerly I tore them to fragments. Let the ingenious
                                        student analyze bits of brass wire, and reduce to its simple
                                        elements as much gunpowder as he pleases, but I raise my
                                        voice against this wanton destruction of rare and beautiful
                                        flowers. No chemical process can ever restore
                                        <emph>them</emph>.</p>
            <p>As I glance over this new page, I see a merry troop of little
                                        girls, crowding around their kind teacher, trying to
                                        restrain their superabundant spirits, and restless activity,
                                        till they may give them free scope in the woods. Passing up
                                        the street, they are joined by fresh recruits, who come<pb n="135"/> dancing out of
                                        the houses, with baskets, and trowels, and tin boxes, and
                                        delightfully mysterious suppers packed away nicely, to be
                                        eaten in the most romantic place that can be
                                        found,— provided there is no danger of snakes, or
                                        ivy. Where they are going I should find it impossible to
                                        say, until I have consulted the new leaf just turned over.
                                        Here, side by side, are the wild Columbine and the cheerful
                                        little Bethlehem Star. They grew, I remember, upon
                                        Powder-House Hill, so named from the massive granite
                                        building upon its summit, which we never dared to go near,
                                        for fear of an explosion. The hill was rough, rocky, barren,
                                        and in some places quite steep. In the clefts of the rocks,
                                        generally far above our reach, the bright red columbines
                                        stood in groups, drooping their graceful heads. Some of the
                                        rocks were worn to a perfect polish by the feet of daring
                                        sliders. It was a dangerous pastime even to the most
                                        experienced. A loss of balance, a slight deviation from the
                                        beaten track, a trip in a hollow, or a momentary
                                        entanglement in your dress,—and you are lost! I
                                        declined joining in the diversion ever after the first
                                        attempt, which was nothing but a headlong plunge from top to

                                        I heroically stood aloof while the girls were enjoying the
                                        sport, and making the air ring with their laughter, I was
                                        sure, afterwards, to come upon the slippery places
                                        unintentionally, and take a slide whether I would or not. I
                                        had, I remember, a most unfortunate propensity for climbing
                                        and scrambling, choosing the worst paths, and daring the
                                        others to follow my lead on precarious footholds. It was
                                        unfortunate, because I seldom came forth from these trials
                                        unscathed. I was always tearing my dresses in clambering
                                        over fences, or bumping my head in creeping under. Where
                                        others cleared brooks with a light spring, I landed in the
                                        middle. I was sure to pick out spongy, oozy, slippery grass
                                        to stand upon, in marshy land, or was yet more likely to
                                        slump through over shoes in black mud. Banks always caved in
                                        beneath my feet, unexpectedly. Brambles seemed to enter into
                                        a conspiracy to lay violent hands on me, and hidden boughs
                                        lay in wait to trip me up. Moss and bark scaled off the
                                        trunks of fallen trees, bearing me with it when I was least
                                        on my guard, or the trunks themselves, solid enough to all
                                        appearance, crushed to powder beneath my unwary tread. Even
                                        the stone walls deserted me.<pb n="137"/> I made use of one as a bridge, one
                                        day, to reach a golden cowslip that grew temptingly in a
                                        swamp; but a treacherous stone rolled off with me, and a
                                        perfect avalanche of huge rocks followed, splashing the
                                        muddy water all over me as I sat, helplessly, buoyed up by
                                        the tall grass. I regret to say, I forgot the cowslip.</p>

            <head>COWS.</head>
            <p>I ADMIRE cows in their proper places. They are undoubtedly useful
                                        animals; some may think them handsome and graceful: this is,
                                        as yet, an unsettled question. They certainly figure pretty
                                        extensively in all sketches of rural scenery, and may,
                                        therefore, be considered as picturesque objects; but I think
                                        that on canvas they take to themselves beauties which they
                                        do not possess in actual life. I do not object to see them
                                        at a distance, quietly grazing in a meadow by the brink of a
                                        winding stream, and all that sort of thing, provided the
                                        distance is very great, and a strong fence intervenes. For I
                                        would have you know, that I am a delicate young lady of
                                        nervous temperament and keen sensibilities, and have a
                                        mortal dread of cows. I am not used to the customs of
                                        country life, which place<pb n="143"/> this animal on a level with domestic
                                        pets, and when my brother asked me to pat the side of one of
                                        these great, coarse brutes, I screamed at the mere idea. For
                                        I should be extremely unwilling to provoke one of them,
                                        because I have been told that, when heated with passion, as
                                        these beasts often are, it sometimes happens that the
                                        powder-horns on top of their heads explode, and spread ruin
                                        and desolation around. People here bestow a vast deal too
                                        much consideration on these unpleasant animals, for they are
                                        often seen—that is, those of them that are
                                        troubled with weak eyes—walking along the streets
                                        with boards over their faces, as a protection from the rays
                                        of the sun. I don't believe that is the real reason of the
                                        thing, though my brother assures me that it is. I think,
                                        myself, that it is intended as a keen satire upon those
                                        young ladies who wear veils in the streets; but I never will
                                        yield my point. I <emph>will</emph> wear my veil, so long as
                                        I have a complexion worth protecting, and so long as there
                                        are gentlemen worth cutting. The Brighton Bridge Battery is
                                        a delightful promenade on a warm summer's day, it is
                                                <emph>so</emph> shady; but it is closed, I may say,
                                        every Wednesday and Thursday, to <orig>accommo-</orig>
               <pb n="144"/> date these detestable pets of the public. It seems, as my
                                        brother informs me, that the drovers, from humane
                                        considerations, are in the habit of driving their cattle
                                        over to Brighton, (when the weather is pleasant,) and back
                                        again on the next day, in order that their health may be
                                        improved by the sea-air which blows up Charles River. Now I
                                        think that when the cow takes precedence of the lady, and
                                        usurps, to the utter exclusion of the latter, the most
                                        delightful promenade in Cambridge, it is time the city
                                        authorities should look to it; and so I told my brother. He
                                        considered for a moment, and then advised me not to bear it
                                        any longer, but to go upon Brighton Bridge, <emph>in
                                        spite</emph> of the cows, and assert my independence. I
                                        followed his advice, as I always do, and, on one fine
                                        afternoon, took advantage of the pleasant weather to indulge
                                        in a solitary walk in that direction. As I was sauntering
                                        along on the wooden sidewalk, gazing at the noble ships
                                        which lay moored by their gaff-topsails to the abutments of
                                        the bridge, and viewing the honest sailors as they
                                        promenaded up and down the string-ladders at the command of
                                        their captains, my fears were aroused by a distant
                                        commotion. I hastily turned and looked<pb n="145"/> over the railing into
                                        the street. A whole drove of infuriated cows, urged on by
                                        two fiendish boys and a savage dog, was rapidly approaching
                                        me from the Cambridge side. What should I do? I was too much
                                        fatigued to run, and I had never learned to swim. My plans
                                        were hastily formed. Flinging my red silk visite and
                                        sky-blue parasolette into the water, lest the gay colors
                                        should still more enrage the wild animals, I jumped over the
                                        outside railing towards the river, and hung by one arm over
                                        the angry flood during a moment of speechless agony! On they
                                        came, with lightning speed, in a whirlwind of dust. A rapid
                                        succession of earthquakes—
                                        bellowings—groans,—and all was over. I
                                        was safe. On inspection of the footmarks, I felt quite sure
                                        that some of them must have approached within ten yards of
                                        me, and only two railings had intervened between me and
                                        their fury.</p>
            <p>An honest tar from one of the men-of-war employed in unloading
                                        coal at Willard's Wharf took the captain's gig, and made for
                                        my parasol and visite as they floated away, and returned
                                        them with the very unintelligible remark, that I'd "better
                                        not clear the wreck next time unless it blew more of a
                                        breeze."</p>

            <head>THE FOURTH OF JULY.</head>
            <p>IT was the anniversary of our Glorious Fourth. The evil genius
                                        who specially presides over the destinies of unoffending
                                        college boys put it into the heads of five of us to
                                        celebrate the day by an excursion by water to Nahant Beach.
                                        The morning was delightful,— the cool summer air
                                        just freshening into a steady and favoring breeze, the sun
                                        tempered in his ferocity by an occasional cloud above us,
                                        the sea calm and pleasant—and all that sort of
                                        thing, you know—just what you want on such
                                        occasions,—and we set sail from Braman's, resolved
                                        to have "a jolly good time." I can't describe our passage
                                        down. It was altogether too full of fun to be written on one
                                        sheet. Suffice it to say, we laughed, and sang, and joked,
                                        and ate, and drank ('t was when we were young), and so<pb n="154"/> on, all the way, and
                                        in fact I felt rather disappointed at arriving so soon as we
                                        did at our destined port. Here new pleasures awaited us, in
                                        the shape of acquaintances unexpected and unexpecting, rides
                                        on the beach, bowling, and loafing in
                                        general,—much too rich to be described here and
                                        now. But there is an end to all sport, and ours came quite
                                        too soon. The shadows had begun to lengthen considerably
                                        before we thought of starting on our return, and certain
                                        ominous indications in the heavens above us warned us, that,
                                        as our passage homewards was not by land, further delay was
                                        unadvisable.</p>
            <p>Dolefully we set our sail, and made for Boston Harbor. We began
                                        to feel the reaction which always follows a season of
                                        extreme joviality, and our spirits were down. Our chief wit,
                                        Tom B——, who had before kept us in a
                                        perpetual roar all the way, sat moody and desponding, and
                                        answered gruffly every question put to him; speaking only
                                        when spoken to, and then in monosyllables rarely used in
                                        polite circles. Our <emph>other</emph> joker, second only to
                                        Tom, the above named, having amused us during the whole day
                                        by long yarns spun out from a varied experience and a rich
                                        imagination, betook himself to <orig>slum-</orig>
               <pb n="155"/> ber, and tried to dream that he was safe home again. The
                                        rest of us performed our duties about the boat in gloomy
                                        silence, looking occasionally with some anxiety at the
                                        clouds gathering slowly over our heads, but keeping our
                                        opinions within our own breasts. I had no apprehension of
                                        danger, for nothing indicated a gale; in fact, the breeze
                                        was gradually deserting us. All that was to be feared was a
                                        calm, steady rain, which, visiting us at a distance of
                                        several miles from home, and late at night, promised any
                                        thing but an agreeable conclusion to our day's excursion. At
                                        last it came. First, a heavy drop, then a few more, and then
                                        a regular, straight, old-fashioned pour.</p>
            <p>Our sail hung motionless, and we seemed to stand still and take
                                        it. Our companions were soon roused from their abstraction
                                        by the very unpleasant circumstances, and we hastily took
                                        counsel together.</p>
            <p>"Unship the mast," says Tom, "and over with your oars."</p>
            <p>We obeyed our captain sulkily, and soon were moving on again. We
                                        pulled away for an hour or so, drenched with the rain, which
                                        seemed to come down faster than ever, and were about as<pb n="156"/> miserable and
                                        down-cast a pack of wretches as ever lived; for there is
                                        nothing like a good ducking (to use the common expression)
                                        to take the life and spirit out of a man, not to mention the
                                        other discomforts that attended our situation.</p>
            <p>Silently we rowed, and not a sound was heard above the plashing
                                        of the rain upon the surface of the sea, and the regular
                                        stroke of the oars.</p>
            <p>"It's very strange that we don't reach old Point Shirley," says
                                        Tom, who had been on the look out for this landmark during
                                        the last half-hour.</p>
            <p>"Very strange," said we, and pulled away as before.</p>
            <p>Thus passed another half-hour in silent, ceaseless occupation,
                                        when, from the mere force of habit, I dipped my hand over
                                        the boat's gunwale, with the hope of cooling my blistered
                                        palm in the salt water. Judge of my surprise, when I found
                                        my hand immersed in <emph>thick black mud</emph>.</p>
            <p>"By Jove, fellows," cried I, "we're floored!"</p>
            <p>There was no mistaking the fact; we were aground. At that instant
                                        the moon burst out from between the drifting clouds, and, as
                                        if in derision, threw a streak of light over our melancholy
                                        position. There we were, high and dry<pb n="157"/> on a bank of mud, a
                                        scooped furrow on each side of us attesting the frantic
                                        efforts of our oarsmen to get a headway, and a long wake,
                                        ten feet in extent, marking our distance from the sea behind
                                        us. Such was our position as the moon revealed it to us. We
                                        looked dolefully in one another's faces for three minutes;
                                        then a grim smile gradually stole over Tom's expressive
                                        countenance, as he slowly ejaculated, "Point Shirley it is!"
                                        when the ludicrous side of the matter seemed to occur to
                                        each of us simultaneously, and we indulged ourselves with a
                                        roar of laughter,—the first since we had left
                                        Nahant.</p>
            <p>Of course, nothing could be done under the circumstances; but we
                                        must wait patiently for the rising of the tide to float us
                                        off. So we sat there in our wet garments until the dead of
                                        night, when our boat gradually lifted herself off and we
                                        started again, and finally arrived at Braman's early in the
                                        morning.</p>
            <p>The moral of this tale may be summed up in a single
                                        word,—TEMPERANCE.</p>

            <head>FROM THE PAPERS OF REGINALD RATCLIFFE, ESQ.</head>
            <milestone unit="typography"/>
            <p>IN college I was the "Illustrious Lazy." In my professional
                                        studies and avocations, I have been so hard driven, in order
                                        to make up for four idle years, that I am wasted almost to a
                                        shadow, and fears are entertained that I shall wholly vanish
                                        into thin air. My physician talks gravely about my having
                                        exhausted my nervous energy, and sends me to Ratborough, as
                                        the place of all others the most favorable for entire
                                        intellectual repose. I am living with an old aunt, Tabitha
                                        Flint, who was wont to rock me, and trot me, and wash my
                                        face, in my helpless infancy, and can hardly yet be
                                        convinced that I have outgrown such endearing assiduities in
                                        the twenty-five years that have intervened. I let her pet
                                        me, so far as I find it<pb n="159"/> convenient, and, indeed, farther,
                                        because I feel grateful for the kind feelings of which I am
                                        the object.</p>
            <p>There is another personage in the household, who probably thinks
                                        that in the exuberant kindness of my aunt I have a full
                                        average of civility, without the least interest on her part.
                                        Do not for a moment imagine that I am piqued at her
                                        insulting indifference of manner towards a young man who (I
                                        beg you to believe) is not wholly without claim to a glance
                                        of approbation now and then from a lady's eye. You must not
                                        suppose I care at all about the matter. But as I have not
                                        even a book allowed me to take up my thoughts, my curiosity
                                        fixes itself strangely upon this silent, sulky, meditative
                                        little person, who takes about as much notice of me as of
                                        the figure of Father Time over the clock.</p>
            <p>What can such a body have to think about the livelong day that is
                                        so absorbing that all one's bright thoughts, and one's most
                                        whimsical sallies, pass without notice? Should I see her
                                        once move a muscle of her very plain, doggedly inexpressive,
                                        provokingly composed phiz, I should jump up and cry, "Bo!"
                                        with surprise.</p>
            <p>She vanishes several hours at a time, and I<pb n="160"/> hear her humming to
                                        herself, sometimes in one room, sometimes in another. I wish
                                        I knew how she amuses herself, for I find self-amusement the
                                        hardest drudgery I ever tried. I could stamp, I am so
                                        impatient of doing nothing but lounge about; I am as
                                        snappish as a chained cur, as cross as a caged bear. And
                                        while I gnaw my nails, and stretch, and yawn, I hear that
                                        contented, bee-like murmur, and now and then a light, rapid
                                        step on the stairs, or about rooms which I do not frequent.
                                        What can she find to be so busy about, the absurd little
                                        person? how can she be so happy in this dull house alone?</p>
            <p>There is a piano, but as silent as she is. I do not see her
                                        wince, though I drum upon the keys with most ingenious
                                        discords, and sing false on purpose as loud as I can bellow.
                                        I will not ask her if she can play; she can have no ear at
                                        all, or she would box mine in self-defence.</p>
            <p>There is somebody, by name Flora, who is looked for daily by
                                        stage-coach. "Flory," says my aunt, "sings like a
                                        canary-bird, and plays a sight,"—and <emph>at
                                                sight</emph> too, it seems. This Miss Flora will be
                                        found to possess a tongue, I hope, and the disposition to
                                        give it exercise. I do not<pb n="161"/> know certainly that Miss Etty
                                        —— By the way, what is her real name? I
                                        won't condescend to ask any question about her. But really,
                                        I wish I knew whether it is Mehitable. Perhaps Henrietta.
                                        No, no, that is too pretty a name; I shall call her
                                                <name>Little Ugly</name>.</p>
            <p>Hark! I have two or three times heard a very musical laugh in the
                                        direction of the kitchen. Heigh-ho! How can any mortal laugh
                                        in Ratborough! Having nothing better to do, I will go and
                                        see who this very merry personage may be. I will inquire
                                        into this gay outbreak, in a land of stupidity. Hark,
                                        again!—how refreshing! I must and will know what
                                        caused such a gush of mirth. Irish humor, perhaps, for Norah
                                        is laughing, after her guttural fashion, too.—</p>
            <p>As I popped my head into the kitchen, Little Ugly was just
                                        vanishing at the opposite door. I could not make Norah tell
                                        me what Miss Etty put under her arm, as she looked over her
                                        shoulder at me, and darted out of sight. O my noisy boots! I
                                        might as well wear a bell round my neck.</p>
            <p>Stage-wheels are rattling up the road. Now they run upon the
                                        grass before the door. I rush<pb n="162"/> in undignified haste to the window. Shall I—
                                        will I—go and help this long-expected Miss Flora
                                        to alight? No,—for I see forty boxes on the
                                        coach-top. A very handsome girl, really! I will get out a
                                        blameless dickey,—if such there be. First
                                        impressions are important. I wish my hair was cut!</p>
            <p>I hear my aunt coming to inform me of Flora's arrival. I shall be
                                        hugely surprised! Humph!—will it be worth while to
                                        trouble myself about the lop-eared dickey? Little Ugly will
                                        be amused, if I do. She <emph>can</emph> laugh, it seems. I
                                        had thought there was no fun in her mental composition. Yet
                                        I have imagined a glimmer or so in her eyes, when she
                                        thought I was not looking at them, and the shadow of a
                                        dimple in her cheek now and then.</p>
            <p>Instead of Adonizing, I will set my long locks on end, and don my
                                        slipshod slippers. "Yes, Aunt; I hear, good lady! I will
                                        presently arrive, to make my bow to <name>Little
                                        Handsome</name>."</p>

               <hi>Journal, Sept. 23d.</hi> Truly, the presence of Miss Flora
                                        Cooper makes Willow Valley a new place. At least six hours
                                        are taken from<pb n="163"/> the
                                        length of the days, though I have given up my afternoon
                                        slumber, and play chess and backgammon instead of drumming
                                        on the table or piano. Now am I relieved from that tedious
                                        companion, my own self. I never liked him very well; I had
                                        rather do any thing than have a sober talk with a serious
                                        personage, who always takes me to do for not making more of
                                        him. He scolds me, just as a stay-at-home wife lectures a
                                        gay husband, who never returns to his better half when he
                                        finds any thing to amuse him abroad. Good-by, old fellow; I
                                        have found better company than your rememberings or hopings;
                                        to wit, Miss Flora Cooper, alias Little Handsome, alias Aunt
                                        Tabby's Canary.</p>
            <p>The first day or two after her arrival, Miss Flora pouted at me.
                                        I was exceedingly well amused, making all the saucy speeches
                                        I could think of, in the pure spirit of mischief, and taking
                                        no notice of her tossing her pretty head, and turning her
                                        back upon me. Finding that her displeasure was not producing
                                        any particular effect upon the object of it, I imagine the
                                        indignant beauty begins to plot a different revenge on me.
                                        "Ha, ha! Miss Flora! It is not because you like me better
                                        than you did, that<pb n="164"/> you are
                                        all smiles, and grace, and sunshine. I shall not flatter you
                                        the more, I am determined. I am on my guard. You shall never
                                        boast of me on your list of obsequious admirers. No, no,
                                        Little Handsome! I am no lady's man, and never was flirted
                                        withal in my life. I defy your smiles, as stoutly as your
                                        frowns. I like your pretty face; yes, it is exceedingly
                                        beautiful, as far as form and coloring go to make up the
                                        beauty of a face. And the play of the
                                        features,—yes, very lively and pretty, only too
                                        much of it. You should not smile so often; and I am tired of
                                        your pretty surprise, your playful upbraidings, and the raps
                                        of your fan. I want more repose of feature, Little Handsome.
                                        Now, what a contrast you and sedate Miss Etty present! Ah,
                                        very good! I am glad you have given up following Little Ugly
                                        out of the room the moment we rise from table. You sit down
                                        to your tiny basket, and demurely take out something that
                                        passes for work. I don't see you do much at it, however. I
                                        give you warning that I never hold skeins to be wound, not
                                        I. I will not read aloud; so you need not offer me that
                                        'Sonnet to Flora,' in manuscript, nor your pet poet in
                                        print. We<pb n="165"/> will talk;
                                        it is a comfort to have my wit appreciated, after wasting so
                                        much on my aunt, who cannot, and Miss Etty, who will not
                                        understand. I am glad to have a chance to speak, and to hear
                                        a human voice in answer. I like especially to rattle on when
                                        any nonsense will do. Chat is truly agreeable when one's
                                        brains are not severely taxed to keep it going."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 24th.</hi> Charming little Canary! I have spent the
                                        forenoon with her at the piano. I like her playing when she
                                        does not attempt my favorite tunes. It must be confessed she
                                        is apt to vary somewhat, and not for the better always. Her
                                        singing,—Aunt Tabitha well describes it as that of
                                        a canary; sweet and liquid, and clear, and sustained, but
                                        all alike. Her throat is a fine instrument; I shall teach
                                        her to use it with more expression and feeling. We will have
                                        another lesson to-morrow.</p>
            <p>I thought, though, there was a shadow over her face when I called
                                        it <emph>practising</emph>. Etty's eyes met mine at the
                                        moment, a rare occurrence. What was her thought? One cannot
                                        read in her immovable face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Evening.</hi> I am booked for a horseback ride with Little
                                        Handsome to-morrow morning. How<pb n="166"/> did she make me
                                        offer? I did not mean to. All country girls ride, I believe.
                                        I often see Miss Etty cantering through the shady lanes all
                                        by herself. I saw the bars down, at the end of the track
                                        through the wood, one day. I immediately concluded that
                                        Little Ugly had paced off that way, that I need not see her
                                        from my window. I put the bars up again, and lay in wait
                                        behind the bushes. Soon I heard her approaching. I come
                                        forward as she comes near, on that rat-like pony of hers,
                                        who holds his head down as if searching for something lost
                                        in the road. I stand in doubt whether to laugh at her
                                        predicament, or advance in a gentlemanly manner to remove
                                        the obstacle I had put in her way. When lo! the absurd
                                        little nag clears it at a bound, and skims away over the
                                        green track like a swallow, till he vanishes under the leafy
                                        arch. I am left in a very foolish attitude, with mouth and
                                        eyes wide open.</p>
            <p>Now this independent young lady shall be at liberty to take care
                                        of herself, with no officious interference of mine; I will
                                        not invite her to join us to-morrow morning, as I intended.
                                        I wonder if any horses are to be procured that are not rats.
                                        I hope Miss Flora knows enough<pb n="167"/> to mount her pony, for I am sure I
                                        do not know how to help her. Whew! I hope we shall meet with
                                        no disasters! I feel certain Little Handsome would scream
                                        like a sea-gull, pull the wrong rein, tangle her foot in the
                                        stirrup or riding-skirt, faint, fall, break her
                                        neck—O horrors! Will not the dear old Aunt Tabitha
                                        forbid her going?</p>
            <p>What a well-proportioned and ladylike figure it was, now I think
                                        of it! How gracefully she sat upon her flying Dobbin!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 25th.</hi> Rainy. Glad of it. Breakfast late. Miss Etty
                                        did not appear, having been up some hours, I imagine. What
                                        for, I wonder? What can she be about? One thing pleases me
                                        in her. If Aunt Tabitha wants any little attention, a needle
                                        threaded, or a dropped stitch taken up, Miss Etty quietly
                                        comes to her aid. It is so entirely a matter of course, the
                                        old lady only smiles, but any service from Flora calls forth
                                        an acknowledgment; it being a particular effort of good
                                        nature, and generally the fruit of a direct appeal. Miss
                                        Etty talks more than she did, too. While I am talking
                                        nonsense with Little Handsome, I hear her amusing my good
                                        aunty, and I catch a few words, her<pb n="168"/> utterance having a
                                        peculiar distinctness, and the lowest tones being fine and
                                        clear, like those of a good singer on a pianissimo strain.
                                        It is a peculiarly ladylike articulation; was she born and
                                        bred in Ratborough, I wonder? She never speaks while we are
                                        singing. Does she like music, then? I asked her once, but
                                        what sort of answer is "Yes!" to such a question? And that
                                        is all I elicited.</p>
            <p>Music again, the forenoon occupation. Miss Flora does not like
                                        being criticized, I find. One must not presume to set her
                                        right in the smallest particular. Singers are proverbially
                                        irritable! I am not certain <emph>I</emph> could belong to a
                                        glee-club, and never get cross or unreasonable. I hate to be
                                        corrected; but I hate more to be incorrect. I could give
                                        Canary a hint or two now and then that would be serviceable,
                                        if she would permit it. I have no right, however, to take it
                                        upon me to instruct her, and it puts her in a pet. She
                                        laughed it off, but I saw the mounting color and the
                                        flashing glance. I am an impudent fellow, I suppose. Honest,
                                        to boot. I think she need not take offence at what was
                                        intended as a friendly help. I am no flatterer, at least.
                                        Really, I am hurt that I might not<pb n="169"/> take so trifling a liberty in behalf
                                        of my favorite song. I'll walk off as often as she sings it.
                                        Can her temper be perfectly good? And yet, one could not
                                        expect—I ought not to be surprised. Yet I can't
                                        help thinking, suppose— just suppose I
                                        <emph>had</emph> a right to find fault,—suppose I
                                        were a near friend,—would she bear it then?
                                        Supposing she were my companion for life—Humph!
                                        that startles one,—was I near thinking of it in
                                        earnest? She is beautiful; I should be proud of her abroad.
                                        But at home,—at home, where there should be
                                        confidence, would there not be constraint? Must no
                                        improvement ever be suggested, because it implies
                                        imperfection? I hope none of my friends will ever be on such
                                        terms with me; if I am touchy like a nettle, may they grasp
                                        me hard, and fear me not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 26th.</hi> This little sheet of water in front of the
                                        house has the greatest variety of aspects; its face is like
                                        a human face, full of varying expressions. A slight haze
                                        made it so beautiful just before sunset, I took my chair,
                                        and put it out of the window upon the grass, then followed
                                        it, and sat with it tipped back against the house, close by
                                        the window of one of those<pb n="170"/> mysterious rooms where Miss Etty immures herself. I heard
                                        the Canary say in a scolding tone, "I should think you might
                                        oblige me; it is such a trifle to do, it is not worth
                                        refusing. Why should you care for him!"</p>
            <p>No answer, though I confess my ears were erected to the sharpest
                                        attitude of listening. I was wholly oblivious of
                                                <emph>myself</emph>, or I should have taken myself
                                        away, as in honor bound.</p>
            <p>"Won't you now, Etty? I'll only ask for one of our old duets,
                                        just one."</p>
            <p>"No, Flora," said Little Ugly, coldly enough.</p>
            <p>"Why not?" No answer.</p>
            <p>"To be sure, <emph>he</emph> might hear. He would find out that
                                        you are musical. What of that? Where is the use of being
                                                <emph>able</emph> to sing, to sing only when there's
                                        nobody to listen?"</p>
            <p>"I sing only to friends. I cannot sing, I have never sung, to
                                        persons in whom I have no confidence."</p>
            <p>"Afraid! What a little goose!"</p>
            <p>"Not afraid, exactly."</p>
            <p>"I don't comprehend, I am sure."</p>
            <p>"I do not expect you should."</p>
            <p>"I never did understand you."</p>
            <p>"You never will." Silence again.</p>
            <pb n="171"/>
            <p>Flora tuned up, and, of all tunes, she must needs hum
                                        <emph>my</emph> song. I was on my feet in a moment to
                                        depart, when I heard the clear tones of Etty's voice again,
                                        and stood still, with one foot advanced.</p>
            <p>"Flora, you should sharp that third note in the last line."</p>
            <p>Flora murdered it again, with the most atrocious, cold-blooded
                                        cruelty. I almost mocked the sound aloud in my passion.</p>
            <p>"I do not tell you to vex you, only I saw that Mr. Ratcliffe
                                        —-"</p>
            <p>"You need not trouble yourself about <emph>his</emph> opinion."</p>
            <p>"I knew you would not like it, if I told you of a mistake. But I
                                        supposed you would rectify it, and I should have done you a
                                        kindness, even against your will."</p>
            <p>"And I to hate you for it, eh?"</p>
            <p>"If you can."</p>
            <p>"Indeed I cannot, Etty, for you are my very best friend. But you
                                        are a horrid, truth-telling, formidable body. Why not let me
                                        sing on, my own way? I don't thank you a bit. I had rather
                                        sing it wrong, than be corrected. It hurts my pride. I think
                                        people should take my music<pb n="172"/> as they find it. If it does not please them, they are not
                                        obliged to ask me to sing. One note wrong can surely be put
                                        up with, if the rest is worth hearing. I shall continue to
                                        sing it as I have done, I think."</p>
            <p>"No,—please don't!"</p>
            <p>"If I will mend it when I think of it, will you sing a duet?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, though it will cost me more than you know."</p>
            <p>"Poh!" And Flora sang the song, without accompaniment. The
                                        desired sharp rung upon my ears, and set my nerves at rest.</p>
            <p>"Bravo! Encore!" I cried, beneath the window, and was pelted with
                                        peach-stones.</p>
            <p>I wonder when this duet is to come off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 27th.</hi> Have not stirred from the house. But I have
                                        not heard any voice but Flora's. She has been uncommonly
                                        amiable and fascinating, and I—am I not rather
                                        bewitched? I cannot keep my resolution of not being flirted
                                        with. I cannot be wise, and reserved, and indifferent. Am I
                                        trifling? Or am I in earnest? Indeed I don't know. I only
                                        know I am constantly at the side of Little Handsome, without
                                        knowing how I came there. She makes<pb n="173"/> me sing with her, ride with her,
                                        walk with her, at her will, and as if that was not enough
                                        for one day, to test her power over me, to-night she made me
                                        dance with her. And now I feel like a fool as I think of
                                        Etty playing a waltz for us, at Flora's request, and giving
                                        me a long, serious look as I approached the piano to
                                        compliment her playing. I could not utter a word. I answered
                                        her gaze with one as sober, and more sad, and came away to
                                        my room, to have some talk with my real self. Now for it.</p>
            <p>Says I to Myself, "A truce to your upbraidings, you old scold;
                                        tell me at once how you find yourself affected towards this
                                        charming little Flora."</p>
            <p>Says Myself, "There are no tastes in common between her and me."</p>
            <p>Says I, quickly, "Music!" and triumphed a moment or two.</p>
            <p>But the snarling old fellow asked whether I liked her singing, or
                                        her flattery? For his part, he thought we both liked to hear
                                        our own voices, and agreed in nothing else. Taste, indeed!
                                        when I would not let her sing a song I cared a fillip for.</p>
            <p>In short, my self-communion ended in some<pb n="174"/> very sage
                                        resolutions. I feared the beautiful head with the shining
                                        curls was somewhat vacant. And the heart,—was that
                                        empty likewise? Or was that hidden cell the home of all the
                                        loveliest affections, the firmest and purest faith and
                                        motive, every thing that should be there to rule the
                                        life—and—my picture on the wall? A
                                        question this.—Does she love me? "O yes!" answered
                                        vanity. "O no!" said good sense, "not at all. If your
                                        picture is in her heart, it is one of a whole gallery. Don't
                                        be a fop. It is not your character. Don't let Flora make a
                                        fool of you."</p>
            <p>And I resolved—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 27th.</hi> A very dull day. "You are as sober as a
                                        judge," said Flora at breakfast. I caught Etty's
                                        eye,—but it said nothing. Aunt Tabitha, who
                                        yesterday evidently thought me in desperate case, and once
                                        inquired about my income very significantly, now suspected a
                                        quarrel between Flora and me. I was embarrassed, and
                                        overturned the cream. "No great loss," said Etty, seeing
                                        that I was chagrined. "As easy made up as a lovers'
                                        quarrel," said Aunt Tabitha. Silly old woman! No, silly
                                        young fellow! Flora has revenged herself on me as<pb n="175"/> she meant to do, for
                                        defying her power. She has turned my head; made me act like
                                        a simpleton. But "Richard's himself again," and wiser than
                                        he was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.M.</hi> I endeavored to talk more with Miss Etty, that the
                                        change in my manner might be less observed. It was all
                                        natural that I should be as grave as a judge when I
                                        addressed myself to so quiet a member of society. She seemed
                                        to divine my object, and sustained the dialogue; I never
                                        knew her to do it before. It is not diffidence, it seems,
                                        that has been the cause of this reserve; I was the more
                                        diffident of the two, failing to express my thoughts well,
                                        from a hurry and uncertainty of mind which I am not often
                                        troubled withal. It was partly astonishment, in truth, that
                                        confused me. Little Ugly and I actually exchanging ideas! I
                                        shall call her Little Ugly still, however, for I could not
                                        make her look at me as she spoke, nor answer my wit by a
                                        change of countenance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 28th.</hi> Little Handsome cannot be convinced that the
                                        flirtation is over,—absolutely at an end. She
                                        alternately rails at my capricious solemnity, and pretends
                                        to be grieved at it. I can see that nothing but my avoidance
                                                of<pb n="176"/> a
                                        tête-à-tête is my safety.
                                        Should the sentimental tone prevail, and tears come into
                                        those beautiful eyes, I am a gone man. At my earnest
                                        request, (I have grown humble or <emph>bold</emph> enough to
                                        ask a favor,) Miss Etty has brought, or rather dragged, her
                                        work-basket into the parlor. A great basket it is, so great,
                                        that I imagine in her own apartment she gets into the middle
                                        of it bodily. I sat down to watch the motions of her adroit
                                        little digits in darning stockings, and mending homely
                                        garments. I imagined, rather than saw, a humorous gleam in
                                        her eye, as I did so, and there was certainly a slight
                                        contraction of her mouth in length, as if to counteract an
                                        inclination of the muscles to move in the opposite
                                        direction.</p>
            <p>Flora fluttered about the room like a bright-hued butterfly,
                                        pausing a moment at a window or a bookcase, or resting
                                        awhile to play a few capricious notes on the piano, and
                                        sometimes coming to view Miss Etty's employment, as if it
                                        were a branch of industry she was unacquainted with, and
                                        curious about.</p>
            <p>The maples are turning red already. The setting sun threw a
                                        glorious light through their tinted foliage, and the still
                                        bosom of the lake<pb n="177"/>
                                        reflected it in a softened, changeable hue of mingled
                                        crimson and silver. Flora was standing at the door. I
                                        somehow found myself there also; but I talked over my
                                        shoulder to Aunt Tabitha about potatoes.</p>
            <p>"I have a fancy for a walk round the pond," said Flora. After a
                                        pause, she looked at me, as much as to say, "Don't you see,
                                        you monster, it is too late for me to go alone?"</p>
            <p>"Miss Flora, I will second your wish, if you can drum up a third
                                        party," said I, point-blank.</p>
            <p>Flora blushed, and pouted for a moment, then beckoned to Little
                                        Ugly, who disobligingly suggested that the grass would be
                                        wet. It so happened there was no dew, and Flora convinced
                                        her of the fact by running in the grass, and then presenting
                                        the sole of her shoe for her inspection. Miss Etty, her
                                        ill-chosen objection being vanquished, went for her bonnet,
                                        and we set forth, Miss Flora's arm in mine as a matter of
                                        course, and Miss Etty's in hers, save where the exigencies
                                        of the woodland path gave her an excuse to drop behind. A
                                        little boat tied to a stump, suggested to Flora a new whim.
                                        Instead of going round the pond, which I now began to like
                                        doing, I must weary myself with<pb n="178"/> rowing her across. I
                                        was ready enough to do it, however, had not Miss Etty
                                        quietly observed that the pond was muddy, and the boat
                                        unseaworthy. Flora would not have yielded to twenty feet of
                                        water,—but mud! She sighed, and resumed my arm. I,
                                        offering the other to Miss Etty in so determined a way, that
                                        she could not waive accepting it, marched forward with
                                        spirits rising into high glee and loquacity. Presently,
                                        feeling a sudden irritation at the feather-like lightness
                                        with which Little Ugly's fingers just touched my elbow, as
                                        if she disdained any support from me, I caught her hand and
                                        drew it through my arm, and when I relinquished it, pressed
                                        her arm to my side with mine, thinking she would snatch it
                                        away, and walk alone in offended dignity. Whether she was
                                        too really dignified for that, or took my rebuke as it was
                                        intended, I know not, but she leaned on my arm with somewhat
                                        greater confidence during the remainder of our walk, and now
                                        and then even volunteered a remark. Before we finished the
                                        circumambulation of the pond, she had quite forgotten her
                                        sulky reserve, and talked with much earnestness and
                                        animation, Flora subsiding into a listener, with a willing
                                                interest<pb n="179"/>
                                        which raised her in my estimation considerably.</p>
            <p>And now that I am alone in my room, and journalizing, it behooves
                                        me to gather up and record some of those words, precious
                                        from their rarity. Flora and I, in our merry nonsense, had a
                                        mock dispute, and referred the matter to Miss Etty for
                                        arbitration.</p>
            <p>"Etty, mind you side with me," said Flora.</p>
            <p>"Be an impartial umpire, Miss Etty," said I, "and you will be on
                                        my side."</p>
            <p>Little Ugly was obliged to confess that she had not heard a word
                                        of the matter, her thoughts being elsewhere, intently
                                        engaged.</p>
            <p>"I must request you to excuse my inattention," she said, "and to
                                        repeat what you were saying."</p>
            <p>"The latter request I scorn to grant," said I, "and the former we
                                        will consider about when we have heard what thoughts have
                                        been preferred to our most edifying conversation."</p>
            <p>"You <emph>shall</emph> tell us," said Flora. "Yes, or we till go
                                        off and leave you to your meditations, here in the dark
                                        woods, with the owls and the tree-toads, whom you probably
                                        prefer for company."</p>
            <pb n="180"/>
            <p>Miss Etty condescended to confess she should be frightened
                                        without my manful protection.— Quite a triumph!</p>
            <p>"I must thank you," she said, "for the novelty of an evening walk
                                        in the woods. I enjoy it, I confess, very highly. Look at
                                        those dark, mysterious vistas, and those deepening shadows
                                        blending the bank with its mirror; how different from the
                                        trite daylight truth! It took strong hold of my
                                        imagination."</p>
            <p>"Go on. And so you were thinking—"</p>
            <p>"I was hardly doing so much as thinking. I was seeing it to
                                        remember."</p>
            <p>"Etty draws like an artist," said Flora, in a whisper.</p>
            <p>"I was taking a mental daguerreotype of my companions, by
                                        twilight, and of all the scene round, too, in the same grey
                                        tint, just to look at some ten or fifteen years hence,
                                        when—"</p>
            <p>"Let us all three agree," said I, "on the 28th of September,
                                        18—, to remember this evening. I am certain I
                                        shall look back to it with pleasure."</p>
            <p>"O horrid!" shrieked Flora; "how can you talk so! By that time
                                        you will be a shocking, middle-aged sort of person! I always
                                                wonder<pb n="181"/> how
                                        people can be resigned to live, when they have lost youth,
                                        and with it all that makes life bearable! Fifteen years!
                                        Dismal thought! I shall have outlived every thing I care
                                        about in life!" So moaned Little Handsome.</p>
            <p>"But you may have found new sources of interest," suggested I,
                                        perhaps a little too tenderly, for I had some sympathy with
                                        her dread of that particular phase of existence,
                                        middle-agedness. "Perhaps as the mistress of a
                                        household—"</p>
            <p>"Worse and worse!" screamed Flora. "A miserable comforter you
                                        are! As if it were not enough merely to grow old, but one
                                        must be a slave and a martyr, never doing any thing one
                                        would prefer to do, nor going anywhere that one wants to
                                        go,—bound for ever to one spot, and one perpetual
                                        companion—"</p>
            <p>"Planning dinners every day for cooks hardly less ignorant than
                                        yourself," added I, laughing at her selfish horror of
                                        matronly bondage, yet provoked at it. "Miss Etty, would
                                                <emph>you</emph>, if you could, stand still instead
                                        of going forward?"</p>
            <p>"My happiness is altogether different from Flora's," she replied,
                                        '"though we were brought up side by side. What has taught me
                                        to be independent of the world and its notice was<pb n="182"/> my being continually
                                        compared with her, and assured, with compassionate regret,
                                        that I had none of those qualifications which could give me
                                        success in general society."</p>
            <p>"Which was a libel— " I began.</p>
            <p>"Without the last syllable," said Flora, catching up the word.</p>
            <p>"At any rate, I knew I was plain and shy, and made friends
                                        slowly. So I chose such pleasures as should be under my own
                                        control, and could never fail me. They make my life so much
                                        happier and more precious than it was ten years ago, that I
                                        feel certain I shall have a wider and fuller enjoyment of
                                        the same ten years hence."</p>
            <p>What they are, I partly guess, and partly drew from her, in her
                                        uncommonly frank mood. I begin to perceive that I, as well
                                        as Flora, have been cherishing most mistaken and
                                        unsatisfactory aims. My surly old inner self has often
                                        hinted as much, but I would not hear him. Etty may have her
                                        mistaken views too, but she has set me thinking.</p>
            <p>Well, you crusty old curmudgeon, what has been my course since
                                        the awe of the schoolmaster ceased to be a sort of external
                                        conscience?</p>
            <pb n="183"/>
            <p>"You told me study was none of my business," says Conscience,
                                        "and a pretty piece of work you have made of it without me.
                                        Idle in college, and, when you began to perceive the
                                        connection between study and what people call success in
                                        life, overworking yourself, here you are, and just beginning
                                        to bethink yourself that I might have furnished just the
                                        right degree of stimulus, if you had but allowed
                                        it."—</p>
            <p>Hark! hark! It is the duet! That silvery second is Etty's. I will
                                        steal down stairs, and when they have ended, pop in, and it
                                        shall go hard but I will have another song.</p>
            <p>Parlor dark and empty. I fancied I heard Flora giggling
                                        somewhere, but I might be mistaken. Yet the voices sounded
                                        as if they came from that
                                        quarter—and—and I am sure I heard one
                                        note on the piano to give the pitch. Hark! I hear the parlor
                                        door softly shut, and now the stairs creak, and betray them
                                        stealing up, as they probably betrayed me stealing down.
                                        They only blew out the lights and kept perfectly
                                        still.—Witches!—Donkey!</p>
            <p>Etty, your voice is still with me, clear, sweet, and penetrating,
                                        as it was when you talked so eloquently to-night, in our
                                        dreamy ramble.—<pb n="184"/> What if I had early adopted her idea, that with every
                                        conscious power is bound up both the duty and the pleasure
                                        of developing it? Might I not now have reached higher
                                        ground, with health of body and mind? Ambition is an
                                        unhealthy stimulus. A wretchedly uneasy guest too, in the
                                        breast of an invalid. I would fain have a purer motive,
                                        which shall dismiss or control it.</p>
            <p>Etty,—what are the uses to be made of her talents,
                                        while she lives thus withdrawn into a world of her own?
                                        Certainly, she is wrong; I shall convince her of it, when
                                        our friendship, now fairly planted, I trust, shall have
                                        taken root. Now we shall be the best friends in the world,
                                        and I will confide to her my—my—O, I am
                                        nodding over my paper, and that click says the old clock at
                                        the stair-head is making ready to announce midnight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept. 29th.</hi> Capricious are the ways of womankind! Little
                                        Ugly is more thoroughly self- occupied and undemonstrative
                                        than ever. I am chagrined,—I think I am an
                                        ill-used man. I am downright angry and have half a mind to
                                        flirt with Little Handsome, out of spite. Only Miss Etty is
                                        too indifferent to care. I did but leave<pb n="185"/> my old aunt to Flora,
                                        and step back to remark that it was a pleasant Sunday, that
                                        the sermon was homely and dull, and that the singing was
                                        discordant. Miss Etty assented, but very coldly, and
                                        presently she bolted into an old red house, and left me to
                                        go home by myself. When we started for church again, she was
                                        among the missing, and we found her in the pew, on our
                                        arrival. Thus pointedly to avoid me!—It might be
                                        accident, however, for she did not refuse to sing from the
                                        same hymn-book with me, and pointed to a verse on the other
                                        page, quaint, but excellent. After all, old Watts has
                                        written the best hymns in the language.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Evening.</hi> Without choice, I found myself walking round
                                        the pond again. It was as smooth as glass, and the leaves
                                        scarcely trembled on the trees and bushes round it. And in
                                        my heart reigned a similar calm. A strange quiet has fallen
                                        on my usually restless and anxious mind. I thought that in
                                        future I could be content not to look beyond the present
                                        duty, and, having done my best in all circumstances, that I
                                        could leave the results to follow as God wills. At that
                                        moment I could sincerely say, "Let him set me high or low,
                                        wherever he has<pb n="186"/> work
                                        for me to perform." If I can remain thus quiet in mind, my
                                        health will soon return, I feel assured.</p>
            <p>"<emph>If!</emph>" A well-founded distrust, I fear. This peace
                                        must be only a mood, to pass away when my natural spirits
                                        return. The fever of covetousness, of rivalry, of envy, and
                                        ambitious earthly aspirations, will come back. Like waves
                                        upon the lake, these uneasy feelings will chase each other
                                        over my soul. I picked up a little linen wristband at this
                                        moment, which I recognized. "She does not deserve to have it
                                        again, sulky Little Ugly!" said I. "I will put it in my
                                        pocket-book, and keep it as a remembrancer, for —I
                                        am glad to perceive—this is the very spot where we
                                        stood when we agreed to remember it and each other fifteen
                                        years hence. We will see what I shall be then, and I shall
                                        have some aid from this funny little talisman; it will speak
                                        to me quite as intelligibly and distinctly as its owner in a
                                                <emph>silent</emph> mood, at any rate."—</p>
            <p>Heigh-ho! How lonely I feel to-night! Every human soul
                                        is—must be—a hermit, yet there might be
                                        something nearer companionship than I have found for mine as
                                        yet. No one knows me. My real self—Ha! old fellow,
                                        I like you better than I did; let us be good friends.</p>

               <hi>Sept. 30th.</hi> A golden sunrise. How much one loses under a
                                        false idea of its being a luxury to sleep in the morning!
                                        Reclining under Farmer Puddingstone's elm, and looking upon
                                        the glassy pond, in which the glowing sky mirrored itself,
                                        my soul was fired with poetic inspiration. On the blank page

                                        quenched by self-ridicule, as I was debating whether to
                                        write "To Ethelind" over the top. Returning that way after

                                        might except my own) gives her more than a casual
                                        glance.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noon.</hi> "I shall think it quite uncivil of Little Ugly if
                                        she does not volunteer to arrange my share of the booty I am
                                        bringing, now that I have almost broken my neck, and quite
                                                my<pb n="189"/> cane, to
                                        obtain it." This I said to myself, as I came into the house
                                        by the kitchen entrance, and proceeded to deposit my
                                        trailing treasures on Norah's table, by the side of a yellow
                                        squash.</p>
            <p>"Do go with me to Captain Black's," said Etty's voice at the side
                                        door. "The old folks have not seen you since your return."</p>
            <p>"I can't!" said Flora with a drawl.</p>
            <p>"Yes, do! Be coaxable, for once!"</p>
            <p>"It only makes me obstinate to coax. Why not go without me, I
                                        beg?"</p>
            <p>"I am no novelty. I was in twice only yesterday. Old people like
                                        attention from such as you, because—"</p>
            <p>"Because it is unreasonable to expect it."</p>
            <p>"The old man is failing."</p>
            <p>"I can't do him any good. It is dusty, and my gown is long."</p>
            <p>"It would please him to see you. I went to sit with him
                                        yesterday, but Timothy Digfort came in, with the same
                                        intent. So I went to church, having walked in the graveyard
                                        till the bell rang."</p>
            <p>"Owl that you are! I don't envy you the lively meditations you
                                        must have had. Why don't you go? It's of no use waiting for
                                        me."</p>
            <pb n="190"/>
            <p>"What! Will you let me carry both these baskets?"</p>
            <p>"There, put the little one on the top of the other. I don't think
                                        three or four peaches and a few flowers can add much to the
                                        weight. It is tiresome enough to do what I don't want to do,
                                        when it is really necessary."</p>
            <p>And Little Handsome danced into the parlor, without perceiving
                                        me. I laid a detaining hand on Etty's basket as she put
                                        herself in motion, on which she turned round with a look of
                                        unfeigned astonishment.</p>
            <p>"May I not be a substitute for Flora?" I inquired.</p>
            <p>"I do not require any aid," said Miss Etty shyly. "It is not on
                                        that account I was urging Flora. Please to let me have the
                                        basket.—Indeed, it is quite unnecessary you should
                                        trouble yourself," she insisted, as I persevered in carrying
                                        off my load.</p>
            <p>"It is the old red house, is it not?" said I, "with the roof
                                        sloping almost to the ground. And shall I say that
                                        <emph>you</emph> sent this? A view of my strange phiz will
                                        not refresh the old people like the sight of Flora's fresh
                                        young face, but I shall go in, and make the agreeable as
                                        well as I can."</p>
            <pb n="191"/>
            <p>"Are you really in earnest?" asked Etty, looking full in my face,
                                        with a smile of wonder that made her radiantly beautiful.
                                        She turned away blushing at my surprised and eager gaze,
                                        and, taking up her little basket, joined me, without a word
                                        of answer on my part. It was some time before I quite
                                        recovered from a strange flurry of spirits, which made my
                                        heart bump very much as it does when I hear any unexpected
                                        good news. And then I dashed away upon the subject of old
                                        age, and any thing else that came uppermost, in the hope of
                                        drawing the soul-lighted eyes to mine again, with that
                                        transfiguring smile playing upon the lips.</p>
            <p>But I was like an unskilful magician; I had lost the spell; I
                                        could not again discover the spring I had touched. In vain I
                                        said to myself, "I'll make her do it again!" Little Ugly
                                        would'nt!</p>
            <p>She answered my incoherent sallies in her usual sedate manner,
                                        and I believe it was only in my imagination that her cheek
                                        dimpled a little, with a heightened color, now and then,
                                        when I was particularly eloquent.</p>
            <p>Introduced by Miss Etty, I was cordially welcomed. I am always
                                        affected by the sight of<pb n="192"/> an aged woman who at all reminds me of the grandmother so
                                        indulgent to my prankful boyhood. The old man, too,
                                        interested me; he has seen much of the world, in his
                                        seafaring life, and related his adventures in a most
                                        unhackneyed style. I'll go and see them every day. One of
                                        the Captain's anecdotes was very good. "An old salt," he
                                        said, "once—once—" Bah, what was it? How
                                        very lovely Etty looked, sitting on a cricket at the old
                                        woman's feet, and, with a half smile on her face, submitting
                                        her polished little head to be stroked by her trembling
                                        hands! This I saw out of the corner of my eye.</p>
            <p>Hark! Aunt Tabitha's call to dinner. I am glad of it. I was
                                        scribbling such nonsense, when I have so much to write
                                        better worth while.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12 o'clock.</hi> The night is beautiful, and it is a piece of
                                        self-denial to close the shutter, light my lamp, and write
                                        in my journal. Peace of mind came yesterday, positive
                                        happiness to-day, neither of which I can analyze. I only
                                        know I have not been so thoroughly content since the
                                        acquisition of my first jackknife; nor so proud since the
                                        day when I first sported a shining beaver. I have conquered
                                        Etty's distrust; she<pb n="193"/>
                                        has actually promised me her friendship. I am rather
                                        surprised that I am so enchanted at this triumph over a
                                        prejudice. I am hugely delighted. Not because it is a
                                        triumph, however;— vanity has nothing to do with
                                        it. It is a worthier feeling, one in which humility mingles
                                        with a more cordial self-respect than I have hitherto been
                                        conscious of. I can, and I will, deserve Etty's good
                                        opinion. She is an uncompromising judge, but I will surprise
                                        her by going beyond what she believes me capable of. I never
                                        had a sister; I shall adopt Etty, and when I go home, we
                                        will write every week, if not every day.</p>
            <p>But how came it all about? By what blessed sunbeams can the ice
                                        have been softened, till now, as I hope, it is broken up for
                                        ever? People under the same roof cannot long mistake each
                                        other, it seems, else Etty and I should never have become
                                        friends.</p>
            <p>As we left the door of Captain Black's house, and turned into the
                                        field path to avoid the dust, Etty said, "I do not know
                                        whether you care much about it, but you have given pleasure
                                        to these good old people, who have but little variety in
                                        their daily routine, being poor, and infirm,<pb n="194"/> and lonely. It is
                                        really a duty to cheer them up, if we can." I felt that it
                                        warmed my heart to have shared that duty with her, and I
                                        said so. I thought she looked doubtful and surprised. It was
                                        a good opening for egotism, and I improved it. I saw that
                                        she was no uninterested listener, but all along rather
                                        suspicious and incredulous, as if what I was claiming for
                                        myself was inconsistent with her previous notions of my
                                        disposition. I believe I had made some little impression
                                        Saturday night, but her old distrust had come back by Sunday
                                        morning. Now she was again shaken.</p>
            <p>At last, looking up with the air of one who has taken a mighty
                                        resolve, she said, "I presume such a keen observer as
                                        yourself must have noticed that the most reserved people
                                        are, on some occasions, the most frank and direct. I am
                                        going to tell you that I feel some apology due to you, if my
                                        first impressions of your character are really incorrect. I
                                        am puzzled what to think."</p>
            <p>"I am to suppose that your first impressions were not as
                                        favorable as those of Mrs. Black, whom I heard remark that I
                                        was an amiable youth, with an uncommonly pleasant smile."</p>
            <p>"Just the opposite, in fact,—pardon me! To<pb n="195"/> my eye, you had a
                                        mocking, ironical cast of countenance. I felt sure at once
                                        you were the sort of person I never could make a
                                                <emph>friend</emph> of, and acquaintances I leave to
                                        Flora, who wants to know every body. I thought the less I
                                        had to do with you the better."</p>
            <p>I felt hurt, and almost insulted. I had not been mistaken, then;
                                        she had disliked me, and perhaps disliked me yet.</p>
            <p>"It was not that I stood in fear of your satire," she continued;
                                        "I am indifferent to ridicule or censure in general; no one
                                        but a <emph>friend</emph> has power to wound me."</p>
            <p>A flattering emphasis, truly! I felt my temper a little stirred
                                        by Miss Etty's frankness. I was sulkily silent.</p>
            <p>"<emph>I</emph> had no claim to any forbearance, any
                                        consideration for peculiarities of any sort. I am perfectly
                                        resigned to being the theme of your wit in any circle, if
                                        you can find aught in <emph>my</emph> country-bred ways to
                                        amuse you."</p>
            <p>Zounds! I must speak.</p>
            <p>"My conduct to Flora must have confirmed the charming impression
                                        produced by my unlucky phiz, I imagine. But don't bear
                                        malice against me in <emph>her</emph> behalf; you must have
                                        seen that she was perfectly able to revenge herself."</p>
            <pb n="196"/>
            <p>Etty's light-hearted laugh rung out, and reminded me of my once
                                        baffled curiosity when it reached my ear from Norah's
                                        domain. But though this unsuppressed mirth of hers revealed
                                        the prettiest row of teeth in the world, and made the whole
                                        face decidedly beautiful, somehow or other it gave me no
                                        pleasure, but rather a feeling of depression. My joining in
                                        it was pure pretence.</p>
            <p>Presently the brightness faded, and I found myself gazing at the
                                        cold countenance of Little Ugly again.</p>
            <p>"No, I did not refer to Flora," said she. "As you say, she can
                                        avenge her own quarrel, and we both were quite as ready to
                                        laugh at you, as you could be to laugh at us, I assure you."</p>
            <p>"No doubt of it," said I, with some pique.</p>
            <p>"But what I cannot forgive you, cannot think of with any
                                        toleration, is—"</p>
            <p>"What?" cried I, astonished. "How have I offended?"</p>
            <p>"A man of any right feeling at all could not make game of an aged
                                        woman, his own relative, at the same time that he was
                                        receiving her hearty and affectionate hospitality."</p>
            <p>"Neither have I done so," cried I, in a <orig>tower-</orig>
               <pb n="197"/> ing passion. "You do me a great wrong in accusing me of
                                        it. I would knock any man down who should treat my aunt with
                                        any disrespect. And if I have sometimes allowed Flora to do
                                        it unrebuked, you well know that she might once have pulled
                                        my hair, or cuffed my ears, and I should have thought it a
                                        becoming thing for a young lady to do. I have played the
                                        fool under your eye, and submit that you should entertain no
                                        high opinion of my wisdom. But you have no right to judge so
                                        unfavorably of my heart. If I have spoken to my aunt with
                                        boyish petulance when she vexed me, at least it was to her
                                        face, and regretted and atoned for to her satisfaction. I am
                                        incapable of deceiving her, much less of ridiculing her
                                        either behind her back or before her face. I respond to her
                                        love for me with sincere gratitude, and the sister of my
                                        grandmother shall never want any attention that an own
                                        grandson could render while I live. I shall find it hard to
                                        forgive you this accusation, Miss Etty," I said, haughtily,
                                        and shut my mouth as if I would never speak to her again.</p>
            <p>She made no answer, but looked up into my face with one of those
                                        wondrous smiles. It went as straight to my heart as a pistol
                                                bullet<pb n="198"/> could
                                        do, my high indignation proving no defence against it. I was
                                        instantly vanquished, and as I heartily shook the hand she
                                        held out to me, I was just able to refrain from pressing it
                                        to my lips, which, now I think of it, would have been a most
                                        absurd thing for me to do. I wonder what could have made me
                                        think of doing it!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After Dinner.</hi> I hear Flora's musical laugh in the
                                        mysterious boudoir, and a low, congratulatory little murmur
                                        of good humor on Etty's part. I believe she is afraid to
                                        laugh loud, lest I should hear her do it, and rush to the
                                        spot. The door is ajar; I'll storm the castle.</p>
            <p>Flora admitted me with a shout of welcome, the instant I tapped.
                                        Etty pushed a rocking- chair toward me, but said nothing.
                                        The little room was almost lined with books. Drawings,
                                        paintings, shells, corals, and, in the sunny window, plants,
                                        met my exploring gaze, but the great basket was nowhere to
                                        be seen. It was got up for the nonce, I imagine. Etty a
                                        rogue!</p>
            <p>"This is the pleasantest nook in the house. It is a shame you
                                        have not been let in before," said Flora, zealously. "You
                                        shall see Etty's drawings." Neither of us opened the
                                                portfolio<pb n="199"/>
                                        she seized, however, but watched Etty's eyes. They were cast
                                        down with a diffident blush which gave me pain; I was indeed
                                        an intruder. She gave us the permission we waited for,
                                        however. There were many good copies of lessons: those I did
                                        not dwell upon. But the sketches, spirited though imperfect,
                                        I studied as if they had been those of an Allston. Etty was
                                        evidently in a fidget at this preference of the smallest
                                        line of original talent over the corrected performances
                                        which are like those of every body else. I drew out a
                                        full-length figure done in black chalk on brown paper. It
                                        chained Flora's wondering attention as quite new. It was a
                                        young man with his chair tipped back; his feet rested on a
                                        table, with a slipper perched on each toe. His hands were
                                        clasped upon the back of his head. The
                                        face—really, I was angry at the diabolical
                                        expression given it by eyes looking askance, and lips
                                        pressed into an arch by a contemptuous smile. It was a
                                        corner of this very brown sheet that I saw under her arm,
                                        when she vanished from the kitchen as I entered; the
                                        vociferous mirth which attracted me was at my expense.
                                        Before Flora could recognize my portrait, Little Ugly
                                        pounced upon it; it fell in a crumpled<pb n="200"/> lump into the bright
                                        little wood fire, and ceased to exist.</p>
            <p>"I had totally forgotten it," said she, with a blush which
                                        avenged my wounded self-love. Ironical pleasure at having
                                        been the subject of her pencil I could not indulge myself in
                                        expressing, as I did not care to enlighten Little Handsome.
                                        Any lurking pique was banished when Etty showed me, with a
                                        smile, the twilight view by the pond.</p>
            <p>"Do you draw?" she asked; and Flora cried, "He makes caricatures
                                        of his friends with pen and ink; let him deny it if he can!"</p>
            <p>I was silent.</p>
