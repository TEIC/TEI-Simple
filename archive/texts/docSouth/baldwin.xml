            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOME of these papers were published in the SOUTHERN
LITERARY MESSENGER, and having met with a favorable
reception from the Public, and a portion of the Press, the
author has yielded to the solicitations of his own vanity,
and other flattering friends, and collected them in a volume
with other pieces of the same general character. The
scheme of the articles he believes to be original in design
and execution,—at least, no other work with which he is
acquainted, has been published in the United States
designed to illustrate the periods, the characters, and the
phases of society, some notion of which is attempted to be
given in this volume. The author, under the tremor of a
<pb n="vi"/>
first publication, felt strongly inclined to offer a sneaking
apology for the many errors and imperfections of his work;
such as the fact that the articles were written in haste,
under the pressure of professional engagements and
amidst constant interruptions; and that he has no time or
opportunity for correction and revision. But he anticipated
the too ready answer to such a plea: “If you had no time to
write well, why did you write at all? Who constrained you?
If you were not in dress to see company, why come
unbidden into the presence of the public? Why not, at
least, wait until you were fit to be presented?” He
confesses that he sees no way to answer these tough
questions, unless the apology of Falstaff for rushing into
the presence of <hi rend="italics">King</hi> Hal,
“before he had time to <hi rend="italics">have</hi>
made new liveries”—“stained with travel and sweating
with desire to see him,”—be a good one—as,
“inferring
the zeal he had to see him”—“the earnestness of
affection”—“the devotion:” but in
poor Jack's case, <hi rend="italics">“not
to deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience to
shift him,”</hi> was not a very effectual excuse for his coming
out of sorts; and we are afraid, that that other Sovereign,
the
<pb n="vii"/>
Public, is not more facile of approach, or more credulous
of excuses; for, unfortunately, the ardor of an author's
greeting is something beyond the heat of the Public's
reception of him, or, as Pat expresses it, the reciprocity of
feeling is all on one side.</p>
            <p>Without apology, therefore, he gives these leaves to
the winds,—with that feeling of comfort and composure
which comes of the knowledge that, let the venture go as it
may, he loses little who puts but little at hazard.</p>
            <p>The author begs to return to the accomplished Editor of
the Messenger, JNO. R. THOMPSON, ESQ., his
acknowledgments, for revising and correcting this work as
it passed through the press.</p>

            <p>AND what history of that halcyon period, ranging from the year
of Grace, 1835, to 1837; that golden era, when shinplasters were
the sole currency; when bank-bills were “as thick as Autumn
leaves in Vallambrosa,” and credit was a
franchise,—what history
of those times would be complete, that left out the name of Ovid
Bolus? As well write the biography of Prince Hal, and forbear all
mention of Falstaff. In law phrase, the thing
would be a “deed
without a name,” and void; a most
unpardonable <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">casus
omissus.</foreign>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot trace, for reasons the sequel suggests, the early
history, much less the birth-place, pedigree, and juvenile
associations of this worthy. Whence he or his forbears got his
name or how, I don't know: but for the fact that it is to be inferred
he got it in infancy, I should have thought he
<pb n="2"/>
borrowed it: he borrowed every thing else he ever had, such things
as he got under the credit system only excepted: in deference,
however, to the axiom, that there is <hi rend="italics">some</hi> exception to <hi rend="italics">all</hi> general
rules, I am willing to believe that he got this much honestly, by
<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">bona fide</foreign>
               </hi> gift or inheritance, and without false presence.</p>
            <p>I have had a hard time of it in endeavoring to assign to Bolus
his leading vice: I have given up the task in despair; but I have
essayed to designate that one which gave him, in the end, most
celebrity. I am aware that it is invidious to make comparisons, and
to give pre-eminence to one over other rival qualities and gifts,
where all have high claims to distinction: but, then, the stern
justice of criticism, in this case, requires a discrimination, which,
to be intelligible and definite, must be relative and comparative. I,
therefore, take the responsibility of saying, after due reflection,
that in my opinion, Bolus's reputation stood higher for lying than
for any thing else: and in thus assigning pre-eminence to this
poetic property, I do it without any desire to derogate from other
brilliant characteristics belonging to the same general category,
which have drawn the wondering notice of the world.</p>
            <p>Some men are liars from interest; not because they have no
regard for truth, but because they have less regard for it then for
gain: some are liars from vanity, because they would rather be
well thought of by others, than have reason for thinking well of
themselves: some are liars from a sort of necessity, which
overbears, by the weight of temptations, the
<pb n="3"/>
sense of virtue: some are enticed away by the allurements of
pleasure, or seduced by evil example and education. Bolus was
none of these: he belonged to a higher department of the fine arts,
and to a higher class of professors of this sort of <foreign xml:lang="fr">Belles-Lettres.</foreign>Bolus was a natural liar, just as some horses are natural pacers,
and some dogs natural setters. What he did in that walk, was from
the irresistible promptings of instinct, and a disinterested love
of art. His genius and his performances were free from the vulgar
alloy of interest or temptation. Accordingly, he did not labor a
lie: he lied with a relish: he lied with a coming appetite,
growing with what it fed on: he lied from the delight of invention
and the charm of fictitious narrative. It is true he applied his art to
the practical purposes of life; but in so far did he glory the more
in it; just as an ingenious machinist rejoices that his invention,
while it has honored science, has also supplied a common want.</p>
            <p>Bolus's genius for lying was encyclopediacal: it was what
German criticism calls many-sided. It embraced all subjects
without distinction or partiality. It was equally good upon all,
“from grave to gay, from lively to severe.”</p>
            <p>Bolus's lying came from his greatness of soul and his
comprehensiveness of mind. The truth was too small for him. Fact
was too dry and common-place for the fervor of his genius.
Besides, great as was his memory—for he even remembered the
outlines of his chief lies—his invention was still larger. He had a
great contempt for history and historians. He thought them tame
and timid cobblers; mere
<pb n="4"/>
tinkers on other people's wares,—simple parrots and magpies of
other men's sayings or doings; borrowers of and acknowledged
debtors for others' chattels, got without skill; they had no separate
estate in their ideas: they were bailees of goods, which they did
not pretend to hold by adverse title; buriers of talents in napkins
making no usury; barren and unprofitable non-producers in the
intellectual vineyard—<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">nati consumere fruges.</foreign>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>He adopted a fact occasionally to start with, but, like a Sheffield
razor and the crude ore, the workmanship, polish and value were all
his own: a Thibet shawl could as well be credited to the insensate
goat that grew the wool, as the author of a fact Bolus honored
with his artistical skill, could claim to be the inventor of the story.</p>
            <p>His experiments upon credulity, like charity, began at home.
He had long torn down the partition wall between his imagination
and his memory. He had long ceased to distinguish between the
impressions made upon his mind by what came <hi rend="italics">from</hi> it, and
what came <hi rend="italics">to</hi> it: all ideas were facts to him.</p>
            <p>Bolus's life was not a common man's life. His world was not
the hard, work-day world the groundlings live in: he moved in a
sphere of poetry: he lived amidst the ideal and romantic. Not that
he was not practical enough, when he chose to be: by no means.
He bought goods and chattels, lands and tenements, like other
men; but he got them under a state of poetic illusion, and paid for
them in an imaginary way. Even the titles he gave were not of the
<hi rend="italics">earthy</hi>
               <pb n="5"/>
sort—they were sometimes <hi rend="italics">clouded.</hi>He gave notes, too,—how
well I know it!—like other men; he paid them like himself.</p>
            <p>How well he asserted the Spiritual over the Material! How he
delighted to turn an abstract idea into concrete cash—to make a
few blots of ink, representing a little thought, turn out a labor-saving
machine, and bring into his pocket money which many days
of hard exhausting labor would not procure! What pious joy it
gave him to see the days of the good Samaritan return, and the hard
hand of avarice relax its grasp on land and negroes, pork and clothes,
beneath the soft speeches and kind promises of future rewards—
blending in the act the three cardinal virtues, Faith, Hope, and
Charity; while, in the result, the chief of these three was <hi rend="italics">Charity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was something sublime in the idea—this elevating the
spirit of man to its true and primeval dominion over things of
sense and grosser matter.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in these practical romances, Bolus was charged
with a defective taste in repeating himself. The justice of the charge
must be, at least, partially acknowledged: this I know from a
client to whom Ovid sold a tract of land after having sold it twice
before: I cannot say, though, that his forgetting to mention this
circumstance made any difference, for Bolus originally had no
title.</p>
            <p>There was nothing narrow, sectarian, or sectionalno period in Bolus's
lying. It was on the contrary broad and catholic. It had no respect
to times or places. It was as wide, illimitable,
<pb n="6"/>
as elastic and variable as the air he spent in giving it
expression. It was a generous, gentlemanly, whole-souled faculty.
It was often employed on occasions of this sort, but no more; and
no more zealously on these than on others of no profit to himself.
He was an Egotist, but a magnificent one; he was not a liar because
an egotist, but an egotist because a liar. He usually made himself
the hero of the romantic exploits and adventures he narrated; but
this was not so much to exalt himself, as because it was more
convenient to his art. He had nothing malignant or invidious in his
nature. If he exalted himself, it was seldom or never to the
disparagement of others, unless, indeed, those others were merely
imaginary persons, or too far off to be hurt. He would as soon lie
for you as for himself. It was all the same, so there was something
doing in his line of business, except in those cases in which
his necessities required to be fed at your expense.</p>
            <p>He did not confine himself to mere lingual lying: one tongue
was not enough for all the business he had on hand. He acted lies
as well. Indeed, sometimes his very silence was a lie. He made
nonentity fib for him, and performed wondrous feats by a
“masterly inactivity.”</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of this distinguished Votary of the Muse, was
happily fitted to his art. He was strikingly handsome. There was
something in his air and bearing almost princely, certainly quite
distinguished. His manners were winning, his address frank,
cordial and flowing. He was built after the model and structure of
Bolingbroke in his youth, <hi rend="italics">Americanized</hi>
               <pb n="7"/>
and <hi rend="italics">Hoosierized</hi> a little by a “raising in,” and an
adaptation to, the Backwoods. He was fluent but choice of
diction, a little sonorous in the structure of his sentences to give
effect to a voice like an organ. His countenance was open and
engaging, usually sedate of expression, but capable of any
modifications at the shortest notice. Add to this his intelligence,
shrewdness, tact, humor, and that he was a ready debater and
elegant declaimer, and had the gift of bringing out, to the fullest
extent, his resources, and you may see that Ovid, in a new
country, was a man apt to make no mean impression. He drew the
loose population around him, as the magnet draws iron filings. He
was the man for the “boys,”—then a numerous and influential
class. His generous profusion and free handed manner impressed
them as the bounty of Caesar the loafing commonalty of Rome:
Bolus was no niggard. He never higgled or chaffered about small
things. He was as free with his own money—if he ever had any of
his own—as with yours. If he never paid borrowed money, he
never asked payment of others. If you wished him to lend you
any, he would give you a handful without counting it: if you
handed him any, you were losing time in counting it, for you never
saw any thing of it again: Shallow's funded debt on Falstaff were
as safe an investment: this would have been an equal commerce,
but, unfortunately for Bolus's friends, the proportion between his
disbursements and receipts was something scant. Such a
spendthrift never made a track even in the flush times of 1836. It
took as much to support him as a first class steamboat. His bills at
the groceries
<pb n="8"/>
were as long as John Q. Adams' Abolition petition, or, if pasted
together, would have matched the great Chartist memorial. He
would as soon treat a regiment or charter the grocery for the day,
as any other way; and after the crowd had heartily drank—some
of them “laying their souls in soak,”—if he did not have the
money convenient—as when did he?—he would fumble in his
pocket, mutter something about nothing less than a $100 bill, and
direct the score, with a lordly familiarity, to be charged to his
account.</p>
            <p>Ovid had early possessed the faculty of ubiquity. He had been
born in more places than Homer. In an hour's discourse, <hi rend="italics">he</hi>
would, with more than the speed of Ariel, travel at every point of
the compass, from Portland to San Antonio, some famous
adventure always occurring just as he “rounded to,” or while
stationary, though he did not remain longer than to see it. He was
present at every important debate in the Senate at Washington,
and had heard every popular speaker on the hustings, at the bar
and in the pulpit, in the United States. He had been concerned in
many important causes with Grymes and against Mazereau in
New Orleans, and had borne no small share in the fierce forensic
battles, which, with singular luck, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> and Grymes always won in
the courts of the Crescent City. And such frolics as they had
when they laid aside their heavy armor, after the heat and burden
of the day! Such gambling! A negro <hi rend="italics">ante</hi> and twenty on the call,
was moderate playing. What lots of “Ethiopian captives” and
other plunder <hi rend="italics">he raked down</hi> vexed Arithmetic to count and
credulity to believe; and, had
<pb n="9"/>
it not been for Bolus's generosity in giving “the boys” a chance
to win back <hi rend="italics">by doubling off on the high hand,</hi> there is no knowing
what charges of owners would not have occurred in the Rapides
or on the German Coast.</p>
            <p>The Florida war and the Texas Revolution, had each furnished
a brilliant theatre for Ovid's chivalrous emprise. Jack Hays and he
were great chums. Jack and he had many a hearty laugh over the
odd trick of Ovid, in lassoing a Camanche Chief, while galloping a
stolen horse bare-backed, up the San Saba hills. But he had the
rig on Jack again, when he made him charge on a brood of about
twenty Camanches, who had got into a mot of timber in the
prairies, and were shooting their arrows from the covert, Ovid,
with a six-barrelled rifle, taking them on the wing as Jack rode in
and flushed them!</p>
            <p>It was an affecting story and feelingly told, that of his and Jim
Bowie's rescuing an American girl from the Apaches, and returning
her to her parents in St. Louis; and it would have been still more
tender, had it not been for the unfortunate necessity Bolus was
under of shooting a brace of gay lieutenants on the border, one
frosty morning, before breakfast, back of the fort, for taking
unbecoming liberties with the fair damsel, the spoil of his bow
and spear.</p>
            <p>But the girls Ovid courted, and the miraculous adventures he
had met with in love beggared by the comparison, all the fortune
of war had done for him. Old Nugent's daughter, Sallie, was his
narrowest escape; Sallie was accomplished to the romantic
extent of two ocean steamers, and
<pb n="10"/>
four blocks of buildings in Boston, separated only from immediate
“perception and pernancy,” by the contingency of old
Nugent's recovering from a confirmed dropsy, for which he had
been twice ineffectually tapped. The day was set—the presents
made—superb of course—the guests invited: the old Sea
Captain insisted on Bolus's setting his negroes free, and taking
five thousand dollars apiece for the loss. Bolus's love for the
“peculiar institution” wouldn't stand it. Rather than submit to
such degradation, Ovid broke off the match, and left Sallie broken-hearted;
a disease from which she did not recover until about six
months afterwards, when she ran off with the mate of her father's
ship, the Sea Serpent, in the Rio trade.</p>
            <p>Gossip and personal anecdote were the especial subjects of
Ovid's elocution. He was intimate with all the notabilities of the
political circles. He was a privileged visitor of the political greenroom.
He was admitted back into the laboratory where the
political thunder was manufactured, and into the office where the
magnetic wires were worked. He knew the origin of every party
question and movement, and had a finger in every pie the party
cooks of Tammany baked for the body politic.</p>
            <p>One thing in Ovid I can never forgive. This was his coming it
over poor Ben. I don't object to it on the score of the swindle.
That was to have been expected. But swindling Ben was degrading
the dignity of the art. True, it illustrated the universality of his
science, but it lowered it to a beggarly process of mean deception.
There was no skill
<pb n="11"/>
in it. It was little better than crude larceny. A child could have
done it; it had as well been done to a child. It was like catching a
cow with a lariat, or setting a steel trap for a pet pig. True, Bolus
had nearly practised out of custom. He had worn his art
threadbare. Men, who could afford to be cheated, had all been
worked up or been scared away. Besides, Frost couldn't be put
off. He talked of money in a most ominous connection with blood.
The thing could be settled by a bill of exchange. Ben's name was
unfortunately good—the amount some $1,600. Ben <hi rend="italics">had</hi> a fine
tract of land in S-r. He has not got it now. Bolus only gave Ben
one wrench—that was enough. Ben never breathed easy
afterwards. All the V's and X's of ten years' hard practice, went in
that penful of ink. Fie! Bolus, Monroe Edwards wouldn't have
done that. He would sooner have sunk down to the level of some
honest calling for a living, than have put his profession to so mean
a shift. I can conceive of but one extenuation; Bolus was on
the lift for Texas, and the desire was natural to qualify himself
for citizenship.</p>
            <p>The genius of Bolus, strong in its unassisted strength, yet
gleamed out more brilliantly under the genial influence of “the
rosy.” With boon companions and “reaming suats,” it was
worth while to hear him of a winter evening. He could “gild the
palpable and the familiar, with golden exhalations of the dawn.”
The most common-place objects became dignified. There was a
history to the commonest articles about him: that book was given
him by Mr. Van Buren
<pb n="12"/>
—the walking stick was a present from Gen. Jackson undecipherable wordthrice-watered
Monongahela, just drawn from the grocery hard by, was the last of a
distillation of 1825, smuggled in from Ireland, and presented to him
by a friend in New Orleans, on easy terms with the collector; the
cigars, not too fragrant, were of a box sent him by a schoolmate from
Cuba, in 1834 —<hi rend="italics">before</hi> he visited the Island. And talking of Cuba—he
had met with an adventure there, the impression of which never
could be effaced from his mind. He had gone, at the instance of Don
Carlos y Cubanos, (an intimate classmate in a Kentucky Catholic
College,) whose life he had saved from a mob in Louisville, at the
imminent risk of his own. The Don had a sister of blooming sixteen,
the least of whose charms was two or three coffee plantations, some
hundreds of slaves, and a suitable garnish of doubloons, accumulated
during her minority, in the hands of her uncle and guardian, the
Captain General. All went well with the young lovers—for such, of
course, they were—until Bolus, with his usual frank indiscretion, in
a conversation with the Priest, avowed himself a Protestant. Then
came trouble. Every effort was made to convert him; but Bolus's
faith resisted the eloquent tongue of the Priest, and the more
eloquent eyes of Donna Isabella. The brother pleaded the old
friendship—urged a seeming and formal conformity—the Captain
General argued the case like a politician—the Señorita like a warm
and devoted woman. All would not do. The Captain General
forbade his longer sojourn on the Island. Bolus took leave of the fair
Señorita: the parting interview held in the
<pb n="13"/>
orange bower, was affecting: Donna Isabella, with dishevelled hair,
threw herself at his feet; the tears streamed from her eyes: in
liquid tones, broken by grief, she implored him to
relent,—reminded him of her love, of her trust in him, and of the
consequences—now not much longer to be concealed—of that
love and trust; (“though I protest,” Bolus would say, “I don't
know what she meant exactly by <hi rend="italics">that.</hi>”) “Gentlemen,” Bolus
continued, “I confess to the weakness—I wavered—but then my
eyes happened to fall on the breast-pin with a lock of my
mother's hair—I recovered my courage: I shook her gently from
me. I felt my last hold on earth was loosened—my last hope of
peace destroyed. Since that hour, my life has been a burden. Yes,
gentlemen, you see before you a broken man—a martyr to his
Religion. But, away with these melancholy thoughts: boys, pass
around the jorum.” And wiping his eyes, he drowned the wasting
sorrow in a long draught of the poteen; and, being much refreshed,
was able to carry the burden on a little further,—<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">videlicet</foreign>,</hi> to the
next lie.</p>
            <p>It must not be supposed that Bolus was destitute of the tame
virtue of prudence—or that this was confined to the avoidance of
the improvident habit of squandering his money in paying old
debts. He took reasonably good care of his person. He avoided all
unnecessary exposures, chiefly from a patriotic desire, probably,
of continuing his good offices to his country. His recklessness
was, for the most part, lingual. To hear him talk, one might
suppose he held his carcass merely for a target to try guns and
<pb n="14"/>
knives upon; or that the business of his life was to draw men up to
ten paces or less, for sheer improvement in marksmanship. Such
exploits as he had gone through with, dwarfed the heroes of
romance to very pigmy and sneaking proportions. Pistol at the
Bridge when he bluffed at honest Fluellen, might have envied the
swash-buckler airs, Ovid would sometimes put on. But I never
could exactly identify the place he had laid out for his
burying-ground. Indeed, I had occasion to know that he declined to
understand several not very ambiguous hints, upon which he
might, with as good a grace as Othello, have spoken, not to
mention one or two pressing invitations which his modesty led him
to refuse. I do not know that the base sense of fear had any thing
to do with these declinations: possibly he might have thought he
had done his share of fighting, and did not wish to monopolize: or
his principles forbade it—I mean those which opposed his paying
a debt: knowing he could not cheat that inexorable creditor, Death,
of his claim, he did the next thing to it; which was to delay and
shirk payment as long as possible.</p>
            <p>It remains to add a word of criticism on this great <hi rend="italics">Ly</hi>ric artist.</p>
            <p>In lying, Bolus was not only a successful, but he was a very
able practitioner. Like every other eminent artist, he brought all
his faculties to bear upon his art. Though quick of perception and
prompt of invention, he did not trust himself to the inspirations
of his genius for <hi rend="italics">improvising</hi> a lie, when he could well premeditate
one. He deliberately
<pb n="15"/>
built up the substantial masonry, relying upon the occasion
and its accessories, chiefly for embellishment and collateral
supports: as Burke excogitated the more solid parts of his great
speeches, and left unprepared only the illustrations and fancy-work.</p>
            <p>Bolus's manner was, like every truly great man's, his own. It
was excellent. He did not come blushing up to a lie, as some
otherwise very passable liars do, as if he were making a mean
compromise between his guilty passion or morbid vanity, and a
struggling conscience. Bolus had long since settled all disputes with
<hi rend="italics">his</hi> conscience. He and it were on very good terms—at least, if
there was no affection between the couple, there was no fuss in the
family; or, if there were any scenes or angry passages, they were
reserved for strict privacy and never got out. My own opinion is,
that he was as destitute of the article as an ostrich. Thus he came
to his work bravely, cheerfully and composedly. The delights of
composition, invention and narration, did not fluster his style or
agitate his delivery. He knew how, in the tumult of passion, to
assume the “temperance to give it smoothness.” A lie never ran
away with him, as it is apt to do with young performers: he could
always manage and guide it; and to have seen him fairly mounted,
would have given you some idea of the polished elegance of
D'Orsay, and the superb <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">manage</foreign>
               </hi> of Murat. There is a tone and
manner of narration different from those used in delivering ideas
just conceived; just as there is a difference between the sound of
the voice in reading and in speaking. Bolus knew
<pb n="16"/>
this, and practised on it. When he was narrating, he put the
facts in order, and seemed to speak them out of his memory; but
not formally, or as if by rote. He would stop himself to correct a
date; recollect he was wrong—he was <hi rend="italics">that</hi> year at the White
Sulphur or Saratoga, &amp;c.: having got the date right, the names of
persons present would be incorrect, &amp;c.: and these he corrected in
turn. A stranger hearing him, would have feared the marring of a
good story by too fastidious a conscientiousness in the narrator.</p>
            <p>His zeal in pursuit of a lie under difficulties, was remarkable.
The society around him—if such it could be called—was hardly
fitted, without some previous preparation, for an immediate
introduction to Almack's or the classic precincts of Gore House.
The manners of the natives were rather plain than ornate, and
candor rather than polish, predominated in their conversation.
Bolus had need of some forbearance to withstand the
interruptions and cross-examinations, with which his
revelations were sometimes received. But he possessed this in a
remarkable degree. I recollect, on one occasion, when he was giving
an account of a providential escape he was signally favored with,
(when boarded by a pirate off the Isle of Pines, and he pleaded
masonry, and gave a sign he had got out of the Disclosures of
Morgan,) Tom Johnson interrupted him to say that he had
heard <hi rend="italics">that</hi> before, (which was more than Bolus had ever done.) B.
immediately rejoined, that he had, he believed, given him, Tom, a
<hi rend="italics">running</hi> sketch of the incident. “Rather,” said Tom, “I think, a
<hi rend="italics">lying</hi> sketch.” Bolus scarcely
<pb n="17"/>
smiled, as he replied, that Tom was a wag, and couldn't help
turning the most serious things into jests; and went on with his
usual brilliancy, to finish the narrative. Bolus did not overcrowd
his canvas. His figures were never confused, and the subordinates
and accessories did not withdraw attention from the main and
substantive lie. He never squandered his lies profusely: thinking,
with the poet, that “bounteous, not prodigal, is kind Nature's
hand,” he kept the golden mean between penuriousness and
prodigality; never stingy of his lies, he was not wasteful of them,
but was rather forehanded than pushed, or embarrassed, having,
usually, fictitious stock to be freshly put on 'change, when he
wished to “make a raise.” In most of his fables, he inculcated but a
single leading idea; but contrived to make the several facts of the
narrative fall in very gracefully with the principal scheme.</p>
            <p>The rock on which many promising young liars, who might
otherwise have risen to merited distinction, have split, is vanity:
this marplot vice betrays itself in the exultation manifested on the
occasion of a decided hit, an exultation too inordinate for mere
recital, and which betrays authorship; and to betray authorship, in
the present barbaric, moral and intellectual condition of the world
is fatal. True, there seems to be some inconsistency here. Dickens
and Bulwer can do as much lying, for money too, as they choose,
and no one blame them, any more than they would blame a lawyer
regularly <hi rend="italics">fee'd</hi> to do it; but let any man, gifted with the same
genius, try his hand at it, not deliberately and in writing,
<pb n="18"/>
but merely orally, and ugly names are given him, and he is
proscribed! Bolus heroically suppressed exultation over the
victories his lies achieved.</p>
            <p>Alas! for the beautiful things of Earth, its flowers, its
Sunsets—its lovely girls—its lies—brief and fleeting are their
date. Lying is a very delicate accomplishment. It must be tenderly
cared for, and jealousy guarded. It must not be overworked. Bolus
forgot this salutary caution. The people found out his art.
However dull the commons are as to other matters, they get sharp
enough after a while, to whatever concerns their bread and butter.
Bolus not having confined his art to political matters, sounded, at
last, the depths, and explored the limits of popular credulity. The
denizens of this degenerate age, had not the disinterestedness of
Prince Hal, who “cared not how many fed at his cost;” they got
tired, at last, of promises to pay. The credit system, common
before as pump-water, adhering, like the elective franchise to every
voter, began to take the worldly wisdom of Falstaff's mercer, and
ask security; and security liked something more substantial than
plausible promises. In this forlorn condition of the country,
returning to its savage state, and abandoning the refinements of a
ripe Anglo-Saxon civilization for the sordid safety of Mexican or
Chinese modes of traffic; deserting the sweet simplicity of its
ancient trustfulness and the poetic illusions of Augustus
Tomlinson, for the vulgar saws of poor Richard—Bolus, with a
sigh like that breathed out by his great prototype after his
apostrophe to London, gathered up, one
<pb n="19"/>
bright moonlight night, his articles of value, shook the dust from
his feet, and departed from a land unworthy of his longer sojourn.
With that delicate consideration for the feelings of his friends,
which, like the politeness of Charles II., never forsook him, he
spared them the pain of a parting interview. He left no greetings of
kindness; no messages of love: nor did he ask assurances of their
lively remembrance. It was quite unnecessary. In every house he
had left an autograph, in every ledger a souvenir. They will never
forget him. Their connection with him will be ever regarded as</p>

            </lg>
            <p>Poor Ben, whom he had honored with the last marks of his
confidence, can scarcely speak of him to this day, without tears in
his eyes. Far away towards the setting sun he hied him, until, at
last, with a hermit's disgust at the degradation of the world, like
Ignatius turned monk, he pitched his tabernacle amidst the smiling
prairies that sleep in vernal beauty, in the shadow of the San
Saba mountains. There let his mighty genius rest. It has earned
repose. We leave Themistocles to his voluntary exile.</p>

            <p>DID you ever, reader, get a merciless barrister of the old school
after you when you were on your first legs—in the callow
tenderness of your virgin epidermis? I hope not. I wish I could
say the same for myself; but I cannot: and with the faint hope of
inspiring some small pity in the breasts of the seniors, I now, one
of them myself, give in my lively experience of what befell me at
my first appearance on the forensic boards.</p>
            <p>I must premise by observing that, some twenty years ago—
more or less—shortly after I obtained license to practise law
in the town of H- , State of Alabama, an unfortunate client called at
my office to retain my services in a celebrated suit for slander.
The case stands on record,<hi rend="italics">Stephen O. Higginbotham</hi> vs. <hi rend="italics">Caleb
Swink.</hi> The aforesaid Caleb, “greatly envying the happy state
and condition of said Stephen,” who, “until 
the grievances,” &amp;c.,
“never had been suspected of the crime of
 hog-stealing,” &amp;c.,
said,
<pb n="21"/>
“in the hearing and presence of one Samuel Eads and other good
and worthy citizens,” of and concerning the plaintiff, 
“you” (the
said Stephen meaning) “are a noted hog thief, and stole more hogs
than all the wagons in M- could haul off in a week on a turnpike
road.” The way I came to be employed was this: Higginbotham
had retained Frank Glendye, a great brick in “damage cases,” to
bring the suit, and G. had prepared the papers, and got the case on
the pleadings, ready for trial. But, while the case was getting
ready, Frank was suddenly taken dangerously drunk, a disease to
which his constitution was subject. The case had been continued
for several terms, and had been set for a particular day of the term
then going on, to be disposed of finally and positively when called.
It was hoped that the lawyer would recover <hi rend="italics">his health</hi> in time to
prosecute the case; but he had continued the drunken fit with the
suit. The morning of the trial came on; and, on going to see his
counsel, the client found him utterly prostrate; not a hope
remained of his being able to get to the court-house. He was in
collapse; a perfect cholera case. Passing down the street, almost in
despair, as my good or evil genius would have it, Higginbotham
met Sam Hicks, a tailor, whom I had honored with my patronage
(as his books showed) for many years; and, as one good turn
deserves another—a suit for a suit—he, on hearing the
predicament H. was in, boldly suggested my name to supply the
place of the fallen Glendye; adding certain assurances and
encomiums which did infinite credit to his friendship and his
imagination.</p>
            <pb n="22"/>
            <p>I gathered from my calumniated client, as well as I could, the
facts of the case, and got a young friend to look me up the law of
slander, to be ready when it should be put through, if it ever <hi rend="italics">did</hi> get
to the jury.</p>
            <p>The defendant was represented by old Caesar Kasm, a famous
man in those days; and well might he be. This venerable limb of
the law had long practised at the M- bar, and been the terror of
this generation. He was an old-time lawyer, the race of which is
now fortunately extinct, or else the survivors “lag superfluous on
the stage.” He was about sixty-five years old at the time I am
writing of; was of stout build, and something less than six feet in
height. He dressed in the old-fashioned fair-top boots and shorts;
ruffled shirt, buff vest, and hair, a grizzly gray, roached up flat
and stiff in front, and hanging down in a queue behind, tied with
an eel-skin and pomatumed. He was close shaven and powdered
every morning; and, except a few scattering grains of snuff which
fell occasionally between his nose and an old fashioned gold
snuff-box, a speck of dirt was never seen on or about his
carefully preserved person. The taking out of his deliciously
perfumed handkerchief, scattered incense around like the shaking
of a lilac bush in full flower. His face was round, and a sickly
florid, interspersed with purple spots, overspread it, as if the
natural dye of the old cognac were maintaining an unequal contest
with the decay of the vital energies. His bearing was decidedly
soldierly, as it had a right to be, he having served as a captain some
eight years before he took to the bar, as being the more pugnacious
<pb n="23"/>
profession. His features, especially the mouth, turned down
at the corners like a bull-dog's or a crescent, and a
nose perked up with unutterable scorn and self-conceit, and eyes
of a sensual, bluish gray, that seemed to be all light and no heat,
were never pleasing to the opposing side. In his way, old Kasm
was a very polite man. Whenever he chose, which was when it was
his interest, to be polite, and when his blood was cool and he was
not trying a law case, he would have made Chesterfield and Beau
Brummel ashamed of themselves. He knew all the gymnastics of
manners, and all forms and ceremonies of deportment; but there
was no more soul or kindness in the manual he went through, than
in an iceberg. His politeness, however seemingly deferential, had a
frost-bitten air, as if it had lain out over night and got the
<hi rend="italics">rheumatics</hi> before it came in; and really, one felt less at ease under
his frozen smiles, than under any body else's frowns.</p>
            <p>He was the proudest man I ever saw: he would have made the
Warwicks and the Nevilles, not to say the Plantagenets or Mr.
Dombey, feel very limber and meek if introduced into their
company; and selfish to that extent, that, if by giving up the
nutmeg on his noon glass of toddy, he could have christianized the
Burmese empire, millennium never would come for him.</p>
            <p>How far back he traced his lineage, I do not remember, but he
had the best blood of both worlds in his veins; sired high up on
the paternal side by some Prince or Duke, and dammed on the
mother's by one or two Pocahontases. Of
<pb n="24"/>
course, from this, he was a Virginian, and the only one I ever
knew that did not quote those Eleusinian mysteries, the
Resolutions of 1798-99. He did not. He was a Federalist, and
denounced Jefferson as a low-flung demagogue, and Madison as
his tool. He bragged largely on Virginia, though—he was not
eccentric on this point—but it was the Virginia of Washington, the
Lees, Henry, &amp;c., of which he boasted. The old dame may take it
as a compliment that he bragged of her at all.</p>
            <p>The old Captain had a few negroes, which, with a declining
practice, furnished him a support. His credit, in consequence of
his not having paid any thing in the shape of a debt for something
less than a quarter of a century, was rather limited. The property
was covered up by a deed or other instrument, drawn up by Kasm
himself, with such infernal artifice and diabolical skill, that all the
lawyers in the county were not able to decide, by a legal
construction of its various clauses, who the negroes belonged to,
or whether they belonged to any body at all.</p>
            <p>He was an inveterate opponent of new laws, new books, new
men. He would have revolutionized the government if he could,
should a law have been passed, curing defects in Indictments.</p>
            <p>Yet he was a friend of strong government and strong laws: he
might approve of a law making it death for a man to blow his
nose in the street, but would be for rebelling if it allowed the
indictment to dispense with stating in which hand he held it.</p>
            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>This eminent barrister was brought up at a time when zeal for
a client was one of the chief virtues of a lawyer—the client
standing in the place of truth, justice and decency, and
monopolizing the respect due to all. He, therefore, went into all
causes with equal zeal and confidence, and took all points that
could be raised with the same earnestness, and belabored them
with the same force. He personated the client just as a great actor
identifies himself with the character he represents on the stage.</p>
            <p>The faculty he chiefly employed was a talent for vituperation
which would have gained him distinction on any theatre, from the
village partisan press, down to the House of Representatives
itself. He had cultivated vituperation as a science, which was like
putting guano on the Mississippi bottoms, the natural fertility of
his mind for satirical productions was so great. He was as much
fitted by temper as by talent for this sort of rhetoric, especially
when kept from his dinner or toddy by the trial of a case—then
an alligator whose digestion had been disturbed by the horns of a
billy goat taken for lunch, was no mean type of old Sar Kasm (as
the wags of the bar called him, by nickname, formed by joining the
last syllable of his christian, or rather, heathen name, to his
patronymic). After a case began to grow interesting, the old fellow
would get fully stirred up. He grew as quarrelsome as a little bull
terrier. He snapped at witnesses, kept up a constant snarl at the
counsel, and growled, at intervals, at the judge, whom, whoever he
was, he considered as <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>, his natural enemy, and so regarded
<pb n="26"/>
every thing got from him as so much wrung from an unwilling
witness.</p>
            <p>But his great <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">forte</foreign>
               </hi> was in cross-examining a witness. His
countenance was the very expression of sneering incredulity. Such
a look of cold, unsympathizing, scornful penetration as gleamed
from his eyes of ice and face of brass, is not often seen on the
human face divine. Scarcely any eye could meet unshrinkingly that
basilisk gaze: it needed no translation: the language was plain:
“Now you are swearing to a lie, and I'll catch you in it in a minute;”
and then the look of surprise which greeted each new fact stated,
as if to say, “I expected some lying, but really this exceeds all my
expectations.” The mock politeness with which he would address a
witness, was any thing but encouraging; and the officious kindness
with which he volunteered to remind him of a real or fictitious
embarrassment, by asking him to take his time and not to suffer
himself to be confused, as far as possible from being a relief; while
the air of triumph that lit up his face the while, was too provoking
for a saint to endure.</p>
            <p>Many a witness broke down under his examination, that would
have stood the fire of a masked battery unmoved, and many
another, voluble and animated enough in the opening narrative,
“slunk his pitch mightily,” when old Kasm put him through on
the cross-examination.</p>
            <p>His last look at them as they left the box, was an advertisement
to come back, “and they would hear something to their
advantage;” and if they came, they heard it, if humility is worth
buying at such a price.</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p>How it was, that in such a fighting country, old Kasm
continued at this dangerous business, can only be understood, by
those who know the entire readiness—nay, eagerness of the old
gentleman, to do reason to all serious inquirers;—and one or two
results which happened some years before the time I am writing
of, to say nothing of some traditions in the army, convinced the
public, that his practice was as sharp at the small sword as at the
cut and thrust of professional digladiation.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it was such an evident satisfaction to the old fellow to
meet these emergencies, which to him were merely lively episodes
breaking the monotony of the profession, that his enemies, out of
spite, resolutely refused to gratify him, or answer the sneering
challenge stereotyped on his countenance. “Now if you can do
any better, suppose you help yourself?” So, by common consent,
he was elected free libeller of the bar. But it was very dangerous to
repeat after him.</p>
            <p>When he argued a case, you would suppose he had bursted his
gall-bag—such, not vials but demijohns, of vituperation as he
poured out with a fluency only interrupted by a pause to gather,
like a tree-frog, the venom sweltering under his tongue into a
concentrated essence. He could look more sarcasm than any body
else could express; and in his scornful gaze, virtue herself looked
like something sneaking and contemptible. He could not arouse
the nobler passions or emotions; but he could throw a wet blanket
over them. It took Frank Glendye and half a pint of good
<pb n="28"/>
French brandy, to warm the court-house after old Kasm was done
speaking: but <hi rend="italics">they</hi> could do it.</p>
            <p>My client was a respectable butcher: his opponent a well-to-do
farmer. On getting to the court-house, I found the court in
session. The clerk was just reading the minutes. My <hi rend="italics'">case</hi>—I can
well speak in the singular—was set the first on the docket for that
morning. I looked around and saw old Kasm, who somehow had
found out I was in the case, with his green bag and half a library
of old books on the bar before him. The old fellow gave me a look
of malicious pleasure—like that of a hungry tiger from his lair,
cast upon an unsuspecting calf browsing near him. I had tried to
put on a bold face. I felt that it would be very unprofessional to
let on to my client that I was at all scared, though my heart was
running down like a jack-screw under a heavy wagon. My
conscience—I had not practised it away then—was not quite
easy. I couldn't help feeling that it was hardly honest to be leading
my client, like Falstaff his men, where he was sure to be
peppered. But then it was my only chance; my bread depended
on it; and I reflected that the same thing has to happen in every
lawyer's practice. I tried to arrange my ideas in form and
excogitate a speech: they flitted through my brain in odds and
ends. I could neither think nor quit thinking. I would lose myself
in the first twenty words of the opening sentence and stop at a
particle;—the trail run clean out. I would start it again with no
better luck: then I thought a moment of the disgrace of a dead
break-down; and then I
<pb n="29"/>
would commence again with “gentlemen of the jury,” &amp;c., and
go on as before.</p>
            <p>At length the judge signed the minutes and took up the docket:
“Special case—Higginbotham <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Swink: Slander Mr. Glendye
for plff.; Mr. Kasm for deft. Is Mr. G. in court? Call him,
Sheriff.” The sheriff called three times. He might as well have
called the dead. No answer of course came. Mr. Kasm rose and
told the court that he was sorry his brother was too much
(stroking his chin and looking down and pausing) indisposed, or
otherwise engaged, to attend the case; but he must insist on its
being disposed of, &amp;c.: the court said it would be. I then spoke up
(though my voice seemed to me <hi rend="italics">very</hi> low down and very hard to
get up), that I had just been spoken to in the cause: I believed we
were ready, if the cause must be then tried; but I should much
prefer it to be laid over, if the court would consent, until the next
day, or even that evening. Kasm protested vehemently against
this; reminded the court of its peremptory order; referred to the
former proceedings, and was going on to discuss the whole merits
of the case, when he was interrupted by the judge, who, turning
himself to me, remarked that he should be happy to oblige me, but
that he was precluded by what had happened: he hoped, however,
that the counsel on the other side would extend the desired
indulgence; to which Kasm immediately rejoined, that this was a
case in which he neither asked favors nor meant to give them. So
the case had to go on. Several members of the bar had their hats in
hand, ready to leave the room when the case
<pb n="30"/>
was called up; but seeing that I was in it alone, suffered their
curiosity to get the better of other engagements, and staid to see it
out; a circumstance which did not diminish my trepidation in the
least.</p>
            <p>I had the witnesses called up, posted my client behind me in
the bar, and put the case to the jury. The defendant had pleaded
justification and not guilty. I got along pretty well, I thought, on
the proofs. The cross-examination of old Kasm didn't seem to me
to hurt any thing—though he quibbled, misconstrued, and bullied
mightily; objected to all my questions as leading, and all the
witnesses' answers as irrelevant: but the judge, who was a very
clever sort of a man, and who didn't like Kasm much, helped me
along and over the bad places, occasionally taking the examination
himself when old Kasm had got the statements of the witness in a
fog.</p>
            <p>I had a strong case; the plaintiff showed a good character:
that the lodge of Masons had refused to admit him to fellowship
until he could clear up these charges: that the Methodist Church,
of which he was a class-leader, had required of him to have these
charges judicially settled: that he had offered to satisfy the
defendant that they were false, and proposed to refer it to
disinterested men, and to be satisfied—if they decided for
him—to receive a written retraction, in which the defendant
should only declare he was mistaken; that the defendant refused
this proffer and reiterated the charges with increased bitterness
and aggravated insult; that the defendant had suffered in
reputation and credit; that the defendant declared he meant to
run him off and
<pb n="31"/>
buy his land at his (defendant's) own price; and that defendant
was rich, and often repeated his slanders at public meetings, and
once at the church door, and finally <hi rend="italics">now justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The defendant's testimony was weak: it did not controvert
the proof as to the speaking of the words, or the matters of
aggravation. Many witnesses were examined as to the character of
the plaintiff; but those against us only referred to what they had
heard since the slanders, except one who was unfriendly. Some
witnesses spoke of butchering hogs at night, and hearing them
squeal at a late hour at the plaintiff's slaughter house, and of the
dead hogs they had seen with various marks, and something of
hogs having been stolen in the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>This was about all the proof.</p>
            <p>The plaintiff laid his damages at $10,000.</p>
            <p>I rose to address the jury. By this time a good deal of the
excitement had worn off. The tremor left, only gave me that sort
of feeling which is rather favorable than otherwise to a public
speaker.</p>
            <p>I might have made a pretty good <hi rend="italics">out</hi> of it, if I had thrown
myself upon the merits of my case, acknowledged modestly my
own inexperience, plainly stated the evidence and the law, and let
the case go—reserving myself in the conclusion <hi rend="italics">for a splurge</hi>, if I
chose to make one. But the evil genius that presides over the first
bandings of all lawyerlings, would have it otherwise. The citizens
of the town and those of the country, then in the village, had
gathered
<pb n="32"/>
in great numbers into the courthouse to hear the speeches and I
could not miss such an opportunity for display.</p>
            <p>Looking over the jury I found them a plain, matter-of-fact
looking set of fellows; but I did not note, or probably know a fact
or two about them, which I found out afterwards.</p>
            <p>I started, as I thought, in pretty good style. As I went on,
however, my fancy began to get the better of my judgment.
Argument and common sense grew tame. Poetry and declamation,
and, at last, pathos and fiery invective, took their place. I grew as
<hi rend="italics">quotatious</hi> as Richard Swiveller. Shakspeare suffered. I quoted,
among other things of less value and aptness, “He who steals my
purse steals trash,” &amp;c. I spoke of the woeful sufferings of my poor
client, almost heart-broken beneath the weight of the terrible
persecutions of his enemy: and, growing bolder, I turned on old
Kasm, and congratulated the jury that the genius of slander had
found an appropriate defender in the genius of chicane and
malignity. I complimented the jury on their patience—on their
intelligence—on their estimate of the value of character; spoke of
the public expectation—of that feeling outside of the box which
would welcome with thundering plaudits the righteous verdict the
jury would render; and wound up by declaring that I had never
known a case of slander so aggravated in the course of my practice
at that bar; and felicitated myself that its grossness and barbarity
justified my client in relying upon even the youth and inexperience
of an unpractised advocate, whose poverty of
<pb n="33"/>
resources was unaided by opportunities of previous
preparation. Much more I said that happily has now escaped
me.</p>
            <p>When I concluded Sam Hicks and one or two other friends
gave a faint sign of applause—but not enough to make any
impression.</p>
            <p>I observed that old Kasm held his head down when I was
speaking. I entertained the hope that I had cowed him! His usual
port was that of cynical composure, or bold and brazen defiance. It
was a special kindness if he only smiled in covert scorn: that was
his most amiable expression in a trial.</p>
            <p>But when he raised up his head I saw the very devil was to
pay. His face was of a burning red. He seemed almost to choke
with rage. His eyes were blood-shot and flamed out fire and fury.
His queue stuck out behind, and shook itself stiffly like a buffalo
bull's tail when he is about making a fatal plunge. I had struck him
between wind and water. There was an audacity in a stripling like
me bearding him, which infuriated him. He meant to massacre me
—and wanted to be a long time doing it. It was to be a regular <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">auto
da fé</foreign>
               </hi>. I was to be the representative of the young bar, and to
expiate his malice against all. The court adjourned for dinner. It
met again after an hour's recess.</p>
            <p>By this time the public interest, and especially that of the bar,
grew very great. There was a rush to the privileged seats, and the
sheriff had to command order,—the shuffling of feet and the
pressure of the crowd forward was so great.</p>
            <pb n="34"/>
            <p>I took my seat within the bar, looked around with an
affectation of indifference so belying the perturbation within, that
the same power of acting on the stage would have made my
fortune on <hi rend="italics">that</hi> theatre.</p>
            <p>Kasm rose—took a glass of water: his hand trembled a
little—I could see that; took a pinch of snuff, and led off in a voice
slow and measured, but slightly—very slightly—tremulous. By a
strong effort he had recovered his composure. The bar was
surprised at his calmness. They all knew it was affected; but they
wondered that he <hi rend="italics">could</hi> affect it. Nobody was deceived by it. We
felt assured “it was the torrent's smoothness ere it dash below.” I
thought he would come down on me in a tempest, and flattered
myself it would soon be over. But malice is cunning. He had no
idea of letting me off so easily.</p>
            <p>He commenced by saying that he had been some years in the
practice. He would not say he was an old man: that would be in
bad taste, perhaps. The young gentleman who had just closed his
remarkable speech, harangue, poetic effusion, or rigmarole, or
whatever it might be called, if, indeed, any name could be safely
given to this motley mixture of incongruous slang—the young
gentleman evidently did not think he was an old man; for he could
hardly have been guilty of such rank indecency as to have treated
age with such disrespect—he would not say with such insufferable
impertinence: and yet, “I am,” he continued, 
“of age enough to
recollect, if I had charged my memory with so inconsiderable an
event, the day of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> birth, and then I was in full
<pb n="35"/>
practice in this courthouse. I confess, though, gentlemen, I <hi rend="italics">am old</hi>
enough to remember the period when a youth's first appearance at
the bar was not signalized by impertinence towards his seniors;
and when public opinion did not think flatulent bombast and florid
trash, picked out of fifth-rate romances and namby-pamby
rhymes, redeemed by the upstart sauciness of a raw popinjay,
towards the experienced members of the profession he disgraced.
And yet, to some extent, this ranting youth may be right: I am not
old in that sense which disables me from defending myself <hi rend="italics">here</hi> by
words, or <hi rend="italics">elsewhere</hi>, if need be, by blows: and that, this young
gentleman shall right well know before I have done with him. You
will bear in mind, gentlemen, that what I say is in self-defence
—that I did not begin this quarrel—that it was forced on
me; and that I am bound by no restraints of courtesy, or of
respect, or of kindness. Let him charge to the account of his own
rashness and rudeness, whatever he receives in return therefor.</p>
            <p>“Let me retort on this youth that he is a worthy advocate of
his butcher client. He fights with the dirty weapons of his
barbarous trade, and brings into his speech the reeking odor of his
client's slaughter-house.</p>
            <p>“Perhaps something of this congeniality commended him to
the notice of his worthy client, and to this, his first retainer: and
no wonder, for when we heard his vehement roaring, we might
have supposed his client had brought his most unruly bull-calf
into court to defend him, had not the matter of the roaring soon
convinced us the animal was
<pb n="36"/>
more remarkable for the length of his ears, than even the power of
his lungs. Perhaps the young gentleman has taken his retainer,
and contracted for butchering my client on the same terms as his
client contracts in his line—that is, on the shares. But I think,
gentlemen, he will find the contract a more dirty than profitable
job. Or, perhaps, it might not be uncharitable to suggest that his
client, who seems to be pretty well up to the business <hi rend="italics">of saving
other people's bacon</hi>, may have desired, as far as possible, to save
his own; and, therefore turning from members of the bar who
would have charged him for their services according to their value,
took this occasion of getting off some of his stale wares; for has
not Shakspeare said—(the gentleman will allow me to quote
Shakspeare, too, while yet his reputation survives <hi rend="italics">his</hi> barbarous
mouthing of the poet's words)—he knew an attorney 
‘who would
defend a cause far a starved hen, or leg of mutton fly-blown.’ I
trust, however, whatever was the contract, that the gentleman will
make his equally worthy client stand up to it; for I should like,
that on one occasion it might be said the excellent butcher <hi rend="italics">was
made to pay for his swine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>“I find it difficult, gentlemen, to reply to any part of the
young man's effort, except his argument, which is the smallest
part in compass, and, next to his pathos, the most amusing. His
figures of speech are some of them quite good, and have been
so considered by the best judges for the last thousand
years. I must confess, that as to these, I find no other fault than
that they were badly applied and ridiculously
<pb n="37"/>
pronounced; and this further fault, that they have become
so common-place by constant use, that, unless some new
vamping or felicity of application be given them, they tire nearly
as much as his original matter—<hi rend="italics">videlicet</hi>, that matter which being
more ridiculous than we ever heard before, carries internal
evidence of its being his own. Indeed, it was never hard to tell
when the gentleman recurred to his own ideas. He is like a cat-bird
—the only intolerable discord she makes being her own
notes—though she gets on well enough as long as she copies and
cobbles the songs of other warblers.</p>
            <p>“But, gentlemen, if this young orator's argument was
amusing, what shall I say of his pathos? What farce ever equalled
the fun of it? The play of ‘The Liar’ probably approaches
nearest to it, not only in the humor, but in the veracious character
of the incidents from which the humor comes. Such a face—so
woe-begone, so whimpering, as if the short period since he was
flogged at school (probably in reference to those eggs falsely
charged to the hound puppy) had neither obliterated the
remembrance of his juvenile affliction, nor the looks he bore when
he endured it.</p>
            <p>“There was something exquisite in his picture of the woes,
the wasting grief of his disconsolate client, the butcher
Higginbotham, mourning—as Rachel mourned for her
Children—for his character <hi rend="italics">because it was not</hi>. Gentlemen, look at
him! Why he weighs twelve stone <hi rend="italics">now!</hi> He has three inches of
fat on his ribs this minute! He would make as many
links of sausage as any hog that ever squealed at
<pb n="38"/>
midnight in his slaughter pen, and has lard enough in him to cook
it all. Look at his face! why, his chops remind a hungry man of
jowls and greens. If this is a shadow, in the name of propriety,
why didn't he show himself, when in flesh, at the last Fair, beside
the Kentucky ox; that were a more honest way of making a living
than stealing hogs. But Hig is pining in grief! I wonder the poetic
youth—his learned counsel—did not quote Shakspeare again. ‘He
never told his’—woe—‘but let concealment, like the worm i' the
bud, prey on his damask cheek.’ He looked like Patience on a
monument smiling at grief—or beef I should rather say. But,
gentlemen, probably I am wrong; it may be that this tender-hearted,
sensitive butcher, was lean before, and like Falstaff,
throws the blame of his fat on sorrow and sighing, which ‘has
puffed him up like a bladder.’ (Here Higginbotham left in disgust.)</p>
            <p>“There, gentlemen, he goes, ‘larding the lean earth as he walks
along.’ Well has Doctor Johnson said, ‘who kills fat oxen should
himself be fat.’ Poor Hig! stuffed like one of his own
blood-puddings, with a dropsical grief which nothing short of ten
thousand dollars of Swink's money can cure. Well, as grief puffs
him up, I don't wonder that nothing but depleting another man
can cure him.</p>
            <p>“And now, gentlemen, I come to the blood and thunder part
of this young gentleman's harangue: empty and vapid; words and
nothing else. If any part of his rigmarole was windier than any
other part, this was it. He turned himself into a small cascade,
making a great deal of noise to
<pb n="39"/>
make a great deal of froth; tumbling; roaring; foaming; the
shallower it ran all the noisier it seemed. He fretted and knitted his
brows; he beat the air and he vociferated, always emphasizing the
meaningless words most loudly; he puffed, swelled out and
blowed off, until he seemed like a new bellows, all brass and
wind. How he mouthed it—as those villainous stage players
ranting out fustian in a barn theatre, [mimicking]—
‘Who steals my
purse, steals trash.’ (I don't deny it.) 
‘'Tis something,’ (query?)
‘nothing,’ (exactly.) 
‘ 'Tis mine; 'twas his, and has been slave to
thousands—but he who filches from me my good name, robs me
of that which not enricheth him,’ (not in the least,) 
‘but makes me
poor indeed;’ (just so, but whether any poorer than before he
parted with the encumbrance, is another matter.)</p>
            <p>But the young gentleman refers to his youth. He ought not to
reproach us of maturer age in that indirect way: no one would
have suspected it of him, or him of it, if he had not told it: indeed,
from hearing him speak, we were prepared to give him credit for
almost <hi rend="italics">any length of ears</hi>. But does not the youth remember
that Grotius was only seventeen when he was in full practice, and
that he was Attorney General at twenty-two; and what is Grotius
to this greater light? Not the burning of my smoke house to the
conflagration of Moscow!</p>
            <p>“And yet, young Grotius tells us in the next breath, that he
never knew such a slander in the course of his practice?
Wonderful, indeed! seeing that his practice has all been
<pb n="40"/>
done within the last six hours. Why, to hear him talk, you would
suppose that he was an old Continental lawyer, grown grey
in the service. H-i-s p-r-a-c-t-i-c-e! Why he is just in his legal
swaddling clothes! HIS PRACTICE!! But I don't wonder he
can't see the absurdity of such talk. How long does it take one
of the canine tribe, after birth, to open his eyes!</p>
            <p>“He talked, too, of <hi rend="italics">outside</hi> influences; of the <hi rend="italics">public</hi>
expectations, and all that sort of demagoguism. I observed no
evidence of any great popular demonstrations in his favor, unless
it be a tailor I saw stamping his feet; but whether that was
because he had sat cross-legged so long he wanted exercise, or
was rejoicing because he had got orders for a new suit, <hi rend="italics">or a
prospect of payment for an old one</hi>, the gentleman can possibly
tell better than I can. (Here Hicks left.) However, if this case is to
be decided by the populace <hi rend="italics">here</hi>, the gentleman will allow <hi rend="italics">me</hi> the
benefit of a writ of error to the regimental muster, to be held, next
Friday, at Reinhert's Distillery.</p>
            <p>“But, I suppose he meant to frighten <hi rend="italics">you</hi> into a verdict, by
intimating that the mob, frenzied by <hi rend="italics">his</hi> eloquence, would tear
you to pieces if you gave a verdict for defendant; like the
equally eloquent barrister out West, who, concluding a case, said,
‘Gentlemen, my client are as innocent of stealing that costing as
the Sun at noonday, and if you give it agin him, his brother, Sam
Ketchins, next muster, will maul every mother's son of you.’ I
hope the Sheriff will see to his duty and keep the crowd from
you, gentlemen, if you should give us a verdict!</p>
            <pb n="41"/>
            <p>“But, gentlemen, I am tired of winnowing chaff; I have not
had the reward paid by Gratiano for sifting <hi rend="italics">his</hi> discourse: the two
grains of wheat to the bushel. It is all froth—all wind—all
bubble.”</p>
            <p>Kasm left me here for a time, and turned upon my client.
Poor Higginbotham caught it thick and heavy. He wooled him,
then skinned him, and then took to skinning off the under cuticle.
Hig never skinned a beef so thoroughly. He put together all the
facts about the witnesses' hearing the hogs squealing at night; the
different marks of the hogs; the losses in the neighborhood;
perverted the testimony and supplied omissions, until you would
suppose, on hearing him, that it had been fully proved that poor
Hig had stolen all the meat he had ever sold in the market. He
asseverated that this suit was a malicious conspiracy between the
Methodists and Masons, to crush his client. But all this I leave
out, as not bearing on the main <hi rend="italics">subject</hi>—myself.</p>
            <p>He came back to me with a renewed appetite. He said he
would conclude by paying his valedictory respects to his juvenile
friend—as this was the last time he ever expected to have the
pleasure of meeting him.</p>
            <p>“That poetic young gentleman had said, that by your verdict
against his client, you would blight for ever his reputation and
that of his family—‘that you would bend down the spirit of his
manly son, and dim the radiance of his blooming daughter's
beauty.’ Very pretty, upon my word! But, gentlemen, not so
fine—not so poetical by half, as a precious morceau of poetry which
adorns the columns of the village
<pb n="42"/>
newspaper, bearing the initials J.C.R. As this admirable
production has excited a great deal of applause in the nurseries
and boarding schools, I must beg to read it; not for the instruction
of the gentleman, he has already seen it; but for the entertainment
of the Jury. It is addressed to R*** B***, a young lady of this place.
Here it goes.”</p>
            <p>Judge my horror, when, on looking up, I saw him take an old
newspaper from his pocket, and, pulling down his spectacles,
begin to read off in a stage-actor style, some verses I had written
for Rose Bell's Album. Rose had been worrying me for some time,
to write her something. To get rid of her importunities, I had
scribbled off a few lines and copied them in the precious volume.
Rose, the little fool, took them for something very clever (she
never had more than a thimbleful of brains in her doll-baby
head)—and was so tickled with them, that she got her brother,
Bill, then about fourteen, to copy them off, as well as he could,
and take them to the printing office. Bill threw them under the
door; the printer, as big a fool as either, not only published them,
but, in his infernal kindness, puffed them in some critical
commendations of his own, referring to “the gifted author,” as
“one of the most promising of the younger members 
of our bar.”</p>
            <p>The fun, by this time, grew fast and furious. The country
people, who have about as much sympathy for a young town
lawyer, badgered by an older one, as for a young cub beset by
curs; and who have about as much idea or respect for poetry, as
for witchcraft, joined in the mirth with great

glee. They crowded around old Kasm, and stamped and roared as
at a circus. The Judge and Sheriff in vain tried to keep order.
Indeed, his honor <hi rend="italics">smiled out loud once</hi> or twice; and to cover his
retreat, pretended to cough, and fined the Sheriff five dollars for
not keeping silence in court. Even the old Clerk, whose
immemorial pen behind his right ear, had worn the hair from that
side of his head, and who had not smiled in court for twenty
years, and boasted that Patrick Henry couldn't disturb him in
making up a judgment entry, actually turned his chair from the
desk and <hi rend="italics">put down</hi> his pen: afterwards he put his hand to his head
three times in search of it; forgetting, in his attention to old Kasm,
what he had done with it.</p>
            <p>Old Kasm went on reading and commenting by turns. I forget
what the ineffable trash was. I wouldn't recollect it if I could. My
equanimity will only stand a phrase or two that still lingers in my
memory, fixed there by old Kasm's ridicule. I had said something
about my “bosom's anguish”—about the passion that was
consuming me; and, to illustrate it, or to make the line jingle, put
in something about “Egypt's Queen taking the Asp to her bosom”
—which, for the sake of rhyme or metre, I called “the venomous
worm”—how the confounded thing was brought in, I neither
know nor want to know. When old Kasm came to that, he said he
fully appreciated what the young bard said—he believed it. He
spoke of venomous <hi rend="italics">worms</hi>. Now, if he (Kasm) might presume to
give the young gentleman advice, he would recommend Swain's
Patent Vermifuge. He had no doubt that
<pb n="44"/>
it would effectually cure him of his malady, his love, and last, but
not least, of his rhymes—which would be the happiest passage
in his eventful history.</p>
            <p>I couldn't stand it any longer. I had borne it to the last point
of human endurance. When it came only to skinning, I was there;
but when he showered down aquafortis on the raw, and then
seemed disposed to rub it in, I fled. <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Abii, erupi, evasi</foreign>
               </hi>. The last thing
I heard was old Kasm calling me back, amidst the shouts of the
audience—but no more.<lb/>
* * * * * </p>
            <p> The next information I received of the case, was in a letter that
came to me at Natchez, my new residence, from Hicks, about a
month afterwards, telling me that the jury (on which I should have
stated old Kasm had got two infidels and four anti-masons) had
given in a verdict for defendant: that before the court adjourned,
Frank Glendye had got sober, and moved for a new trial, on the
ground that the verdict was against evidence, and that the plaintiff
had not had justice, <hi rend="italics">by reason of the incompetency of his counsel,
and the abandonment of his cause</hi>; and that he got a new trial (as
well he should have done).</p>
            <p>I learned through Hicks, some twelve months later, that the
case had been tried; that Frank Glendye had made one of his
greatest and most eloquent speeches; that Glendye had joined the
Temperance Society, and was now one of the soberest and most
attentive men to business at the bar, and was at the head of it in
practice; that Higginbotham had recovered a verdict of $2000, and
had put Swink in for $500 costs, besides.</p>
            <pb n="45"/>
            <p>Hicks' letter gave me, too, the <hi rend="italics">melancholy</hi> intelligence of old
Kasm's death. He had died in an apoplectic fit, in the court
house, while abusing an old preacher who had testified against him
in a <hi rend="italics">crim. con.</hi> case. He enclosed the proceedings of a bar
meeting, in which “the melancholy dispensation which called our
beloved brother hence while in the active discharge of his duties,”
was much deplored; but, with a pious resignation, which was
greatly to be admired, “they submitted to the will,” &amp;c., and,
with a confidence old Kasm himself, if alive, might have envied,
“<hi rend="italics">trusted</hi> he had gone to a better and brighter world,” &amp;c., &amp;c.,
which carried the doctrine of Universalism as far as it could well
go. They concluded by resolving that the bar would wear crepe
on the left arm for thirty days. I don't know what the rest did, I
didn't. Though not mentioned in his will, he had left me something
to remember him by. Bright be the bloom and sweet the
fragrance of the thistles on his grave!</p>
            <p>Reader! I eschewed <hi rend="italics">genius</hi> from that day. I took to accounts; did up every species of paper that came into my office with a
tape string; had pigeon holes for all the bits of paper about me;
walked down the street as if I were just going to bank and it
wanted only five minutes to three o'clock; got me a green bag and
stuffed it full of old newspapers, carefully folded and labelled;
read law, to fit imaginary cases, with great industry; dunned one
of the wealthiest men in the city for fifty cents; sold out a
widow for a twenty dollar debt, and bought in her things myself,
publicly (and gave them back to her secretly, afterwards);
associated only with skin-flints,
<pb n="46"/>
brokers and married men, and discussed investments and
stocks; soon got into business; looked wise and shook my head
when I was consulted, and passed for a “powerful good judge of
law;” confirmed the opinion by reading, in court, all the books
and papers I could lay my hands on, and clearing out the court-house
by hum-drum details, commonplace and statistics,
whenever I made a speech at the bar—and thus, by this course
of things, am able to write from <hi rend="italics">my sugar plantation</hi>, this
memorable history of the fall of <hi rend="italics">genius</hi>
and the rise of solemn humbug!

            <div type="subchapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
               <p>IN the month of March, A.D., 1836, the writer of these
faithful chronicles of law-doings in the South West, duly equipped
for forensic warfare, having perused nearly the whole of Sir
William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, left
behind him the red hills of his native village, in the valley of the
Shenandoah, to seek his fortune. He turned his horse's head to the
setting sun. His loyalty to the Old Dominion extorts the
explanation that his was no voluntary expatriation. He went under
the compulsion which produced the author's book—“Urged by
hunger and request of friends.” The gentle momentum of a female
slipper, too, it might as well be confessed, added its moral suasion
to the more pressing urgencies of breakfast, dinner and supper. To
the South West he started because magnificent accounts came from
that sunny land of most cheering and exhilarating prospects of
fussing, quarrelling, murdering, violation of contracts, and the
whole catalogue of <hi rend="italics">
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">crimen falsi</foreign>
                  </hi>—in fine, of a flush tide of
litigation in all of its departments, civil and criminal. It was
extolled as a legal Utopia, peopled
<pb n="48"/>
by a race of eager litigants, only waiting for the lawyers to come
on and divide out to them the shells of a bountiful system of
squabbling: a California of Law, whose surface strife only
indicated the vast <hi rend="italics">placers</hi> of legal dispute waiting in untold
profusion, the presence of a few craftsmen to bring out the crude
suits to some forum, or into chancery for trial or essay.</p>
               <p>He resigned prospects of great brilliancy at home. His family
connections were numerous, though those of influence were
lawyers themselves, which made this fact only contingently
beneficial—to wit, the contingency of their dying before
him—which was a sort of <hi rend="italics">
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">remotissima potentia</foreign>
                  </hi>, seeing they
were in the enjoyment of excellent health, the profession being
remarkably salubrious in that village; and seeing further, that,
after their death, their influence might be gone. Not counting,
therefore, too much on this advantage, it was a well-ascertained
fact that no man of <hi rend="italics">real</hi> talent and energy—and, of course, every
lawyerling has both at the start—had ever come to that bar, who
did not, in the course of five or six years, with any thing like
moderate luck, make expenses, and, surviving that short probation
on board wages, lay up money, ranging from $250 to $500, according
to merit and good fortune, <hi rend="italics">per annum</hi>. In evidence of the correctness
of this calculation, it may be added that seven young gentlemen,
all of fine promise, were enjoying <hi rend="italics">high</hi> life—in upper stories
—cultivating the cardinal virtues of Faith and Hope in themselves,
and the greater virtue of Charity in their friends—the only briefs
as yet known to them being brief of money and brief of credit;
their barrenness of fruition in the day
<pb n="49"/>
time relieved by oriental dreams of fairy clients, with fifteen
shilling fees in each hand, and glorious ten dollar contingents in
the perspective, beckoning them on to Fame and Fortune. But
Poverty, the rugged mother of the <hi rend="italics">wind-sellers</hi> of all times and
countries, as poor Peter Peebles so irreverently calls our
honorable craft,—the Necessity which knows no Law, yet
teaches so much of it, tore him from scenes and prospects of such
allurement: with the heroism of old Regulus, he turned his back
upon his country and put <hi rend="italics">all</hi> to hazard —<hi rend="italics">videlicet</hi>, a pony
valued at $35, 3 pair of saddle-bags and contents, a new razor not
much needed at that early day, and $75 in Virginia bank bills.</p>
               <p>Passing leisurely along through East Tennessee, he was struck
with the sturdy independence of the natives, of the enervating
refinements of artificial society and its concomitants; not less
than with the patriotic encouragement they extended to their
own productions and manufactures: the writer frequently saw
pretty farmers' daughters working barefooted in the field, and his
attention was often drawn to the number of the distilleries and to
evident symptoms of a liberal patronage of their products. He
stopped at a seat of Justice for half a day, while court was in
session, to witness the manner in which the natives did up
judicature; but with the exception of a few cases under a statute
of universal authority and delicacy, he saw nothing of special
interest; and these did not seem to excite much attention beyond
the domestic circle.</p>
               <p>The transition from East Tennessee to South Western
<pb n="50"/>
Alabama and East Mississippi was something marked. It was
somewhat like a sudden change from “Sleepy Hollow” to the
Strand. A man, retailing onions by the dozen in Weathersfield,
and the same man suddenly turned into a real estate broker in San
Francisco, would realize the contrast between the picayune
standard of the one region, and the wild spendthriftism, the
impetuous rush and the magnificent scale of operations in the
other.</p>
               <p>The writer pitched his tabernacle on the thither side of the
state line of Alabama, in the charming village of P., one of the
loveliest hamlets of the plain, or rather it would be, did it not
stand on a hill. Gamblers, then a numerous class, included, the
village boasted a population of some five hundred souls; about a
third of whom were single gentlemen who had come out on the
vague errand of seeking their fortune, or the more definite one of
seeking somebody else's; philosophers who mingled the spirit of
Anacreon with the enterprise of Astor, and who enjoyed the
present as well as laid projects for the future, to be worked out
for their own profit upon the safe plan of some other person's
risk.</p>
               <p>Why he selected this particular spot for his <hi rend="italics">
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">locus in quo</foreign>
                  </hi>, is
easily told. The capital he had invested in emigration was nearly
expended and had not as yet declared any dividend; and, with
native pride, he was ambitious to carry money enough with him
to excite the hopes of his landlord. Besides, he was willing to try
his hand on the practice where competition was not formidable.</p>
               <p>The “accommodations” at the “American Hotel” were
<pb n="51"/>
not such as were calculated to be-guile a spiritual mind to things
of sense. The writer has been at the Astor, the Revere and the St.
Charles since, and did not note the resemblance. A huge cross-piece,
like a gibbet, stood before the door—the usual <hi rend="italics">inn</hi>-sign of
the country; and though a very apt device as typifying death, it
was not happy in denoting the specific kind of destruction that
menaced the guest. The vigor of his constitution, however, proved
sufficient for the trial; though, for a long time, the contest was
dubious.</p>
               <p>In the fall of the year so scarce were provisions—bullbeef
excepted, which seemed to be every where—that we were forced
to eat green corn, baked or fried with lard, for bread; and he
remembers, when biscuits came again, a mad wag, Jim Cole,
shouted out from the table that he should certainly die <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, for
want of a new bolting cloth to his throat.</p>
               <p>A shed for an office procured, the next thing was a license;
and this a Circuit Judge was authorized to grant, which service
was rendered by the Hon. J.F.T. in a manner which shall ever
inspire gratitude—he asking not a single legal question; an
eloquent silence which can never be appreciated except by those
who are unable to stand an examination.</p>
               <p>This egotism over, and its purpose of merely introducing the
witness accomplished, the narrative will proceed without further
mention of him or his fortunes; and if any reader thinks he loses
any thing by this abbreviation, perhaps it will be full consolation
to him to know that if it proceeded further, the author might
lose a great deal more.</p>
               <pb n="52"/>
               <p>Dropping the third for the more convenient first person, he
will proceed to give some account of what was done by or to
Themis in that part of her noisy domain.

                  <p>Those were jolly times. Imagine thirty or forty young men
collected together in a new country, armed with fresh licenses
which they had got gratuitously, and a plentiful stock of brass
which they had got in the natural way; and standing ready to
supply any distressed citizen who wanted law, with their wares
counterfeiting the article. I must confess it looked to me something
like a swindle. It was doing business on the wooden nutmeg, or
rather the patent brass clock principle. There was one consolation:
the clients were generally as sham as the counsellors. For the
most part, they were either broke or in a rapid decline. They
usually paid us the compliment of retaining us, but they usually
retained the fee too, a double retainer we did not much fancy.
However, we got as much as we were entitled to and something
over, <hi rend="italics">videlicet</hi>, as much over as we got at all. The most that we
made was experience. We learned before long, how every possible
sort of case could be successfully lost; there was no way of
getting out of court that we had not tested. The last way we
learned was <hi rend="italics">via</hi> a verdict: it was a considerable triumph to get <hi rend="italics">to</hi>
the jury, though it seemed a sufficiently easy matter to get away
from one again. But the perils of the road from the writ to an issue
or issues—for there were generally several of them—were great
indeed. The way was infested and ambushed, with all imaginable
points of practice,
<pb n="53"/>
quirks and quibbles, that had strayed off from the litigation of
every sort of foreign judicature,—that had been successfully tried
in, or been driven out of, regularly organized forums, besides a
smart sprinkling of indigenous growth. Nothing was settled.
Chaos had come again, or rather, had never gone away. Order,
Heaven's first law, seemed unwilling to remain where there was no
other law to keep it company. I spoke of the thirty or forty
barristers on their first legs—but I omitted to speak of the older
members who had had the advantage of several years' practice and
precedence. These were the leaders on the Circuit. They had the
law—that is the practice and rulings of the courts—and kept it
as a close monopoly. The earliest information we got of it was when
some precious dogma was drawn out on us with fatal effect. They
had conned the statutes for the last fifteen years, which were
inaccessible to us, and we occasionally, much to our astonishment,
got the benefit of instruction in a clause or two of “the act in such
cases made and provided” at a considerable tuition fee to be paid
by our clients. Occasionally, too, a repealed statute was revived
for our especial benefit. The courts being forbidden to charge
except as specially asked, took away from us, in a great measure,
the protection of the natural guardians of our ignorant innocence:
there could be no prayer for general relief, and we did not—many
of us—know how to pray specially, and always ran great risks of
prejudicing our cases before the jury, by having instructions
refused. It was better to trust to the “uncovenanted mercies”
of the jury, and risk a decision on the
<pb n="54"/>
honesty of the thing, than blunder along after charges. As to
reserving points except as a bluff or scarecrow, that was a thing
unheard of: the Supreme Court was a perfect <hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">terra incognita</foreign>
                     </hi>: we
had all heard there was such a place, as we had heard of Heaven's
Chancery, to which the Accusing Spirit <hi rend="italics">took up</hi> Uncle Toby's
oath, but we as little knew the way there, and as little expected to
go there. Out of one thousand cases, butchered in cold blood
without and with the forms of law, not one in that first year's
practice, ever got to the High Court of Errors and Appeals; (or, as
Prentiss called it, the Court of High Errors and Appeals.) No
wonder we never started. How could we ever get them there? If
we had to run a gauntlet of technicalities and quibbles to get a
judgment on “a plain note of hand,” in the Circuit Court, Tam
O'Shanter's race through the witches, would be nothing to the
journey to and through the Supreme Court! It would have been a
writ of error indeed—or rather a writ of many errors. This is but
speculation, however—we never tried it—the experiment was
too much even for our brass. The leaders were a good deal but not
generally retained. The reason was, they wanted the money, or
like Falstaff's mercer, good security; a most uncomfortable
requisition with the mass of our litigants. <hi rend="italics">We</hi>, of the local bar
trusted—so did our clients: it is hard to say which did the wildest
credit business.</p>
                  <p>The leaders were sharp fellows—keen as briars—<hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">au fait</foreign>
                     </hi> in
all trap points—quick to discern small errors—perfect in forms
and ceremonies—very pharisees in “anise, mint and

cummin—<hi rend="italics">but neglecting judgment and the weightier matters of the
law.</hi>” They seemed to think that judicature was a
tanyard—clients skins to be curried—the court the mill, and the
thing “to work on their leather” with—<hi rend="italics">bark:</hi> the idea that
justice had any thing to do with trying causes, or sense had any
thing to do with legal principles, never seemed to occur to them
once, as a possible conception.</p>
                  <p>Those were quashing times, and they were the <hi rend="italics">out
quashingest</hi> set of fellows ever known. They moved to quash
every thing, from a <hi rend="italics">venire</hi> to a <hi rend="italics">subpoena</hi>: indeed, I knew one of
them to quash the whole court, on the ground that the Board
of Police was bound by law to furnish the building for holding
the Court, and there was no proof that the building in which the
court was sitting was so furnished. They usually, however,
commenced at the <hi rend="italics">capias</hi>—and kept quashing on until they got to
the forthcoming bond which, being set aside, released the security
for the debt, and then, generally, it was no use to quash any thing
more. In one court, forthcoming bonds, to the amount of some
hundred thousands of dollars, were quashed, because the
execution was written “State of Mississippi”—instead of “<hi rend="italics">the</hi>
State of Mississippi,” the constitution requiring the style of
process to be the State of Mississippi: a quashing process which
vindicated the constitution at the expense of the foreign creditors
in the matter of these bonds, almost as effectively as a subsequent
vindication in respect of other bonds, about which more clamor
was raised.</p>
                  <p>Attachments were much resorted to, there being about
<pb n="56"/>
that time as the pressure was coming on, a lively stampede to
Texas. It became the interest of the debtors and their securities,
and of rival creditors, to quash these, and quashed they were,
almost without exception. J.H. was sheriff of W., and used to
keep a book in which he noted the disposition of the cases called
on the docket. Opposite nearly every attachment case, was the
brief annotation—“<hi rend="italics">quashed</hi> for the lack of form.” This fatality
surprised me at first, as the statute declared the attachment law
should be liberally construed, and gave a form, and the act
required only the substantial requisites of the form to be observed:
but it seems the form given for the bond in the statute, varied
materially from the requirements of the statute in other portions
of the act: and so the circuit courts held the forms to be a sort of
legislative gull trap, by following which, the creditor lost his debt.</p>
                  <p>This ingenious turn for quibbling derived great assistance and
many occasions of exercise from the manner in which business
had been done, and the character of the officials who did it, or
rather who didn't do it. The justices of the peace, probate judges,
and clerks, and sheriffs, were not infrequently in a state of as
unsophisticated ignorance of conventionalities as could be desired
by J.J. Rousseau or any other eulogist of the savage state. They
were all elected by the people who neither knew nor cared
whether they were qualified or not. If they were “good fellows”
and <hi rend="italics">wanted</hi> the office, that is, were too poor and lazy to support
themselves in any other way, that was enough. If poor John
Rogers, with
<pb n="57"/>
nine small children and one at the breast, had been in
Mississippi instead of Smithfield, he could have got any office he
wanted, that is, if he had quit preaching and taken to treating. The
result of these official blunders was, that about every other thing
done at all, was done wrong: indeed, the only question was as
between <hi rend="italics">void and voidable</hi>. Even in capital cases, the convictions
were worth nothing—the record not showing enough to satisfy
the High Court that the prisoner was tried in the county, or at the
place required by law, or that the grand jury were freeholders, &amp;c.,
of the county where the offence was committed, or that they had
found a bill. They had put an old negro, Cupid, in C- county, in
question for his life, and convicted him three times, but the
conviction never would stick. The last time the jury brought him
in guilty, he was very composedly eating an apple. The sheriff
asked him how he liked the idea of being hung. “Hung,” said
he—“hung! You don't think they are going to <hi rend="italics">hang</hi> me, do you?
I don't mind these little circuit judges: wait till old <hi rend="italics">Shurkey</hi> says
the word in the High Court, and then it will be time enough to be
getting ready.”</p>
                  <p>But if quashing was the general order of the day, it was the
special order when the State docket was taken up. Such quashing
of indictments! It seemed as by a curious display of skill in
missing, the pleader never could get an indictment to hold water. I
recollect S., who was prosecuting <hi rend="italics">pro tem</hi>. for the State, convicted
a poor Indian of murder, the Indian having only counsel
volunteering on his
<pb n="58"/>
arraignment; S. turned around and said with emphatic
complacency: “I tell you, gentlemen, there is a fatality attending
my indictments.” “Yes,” rejoined B., “they <hi rend="italics">are</hi> generally
quashed.”</p>
                  <p>It was in criminal trials that the juniors flourished. We went
into them with the same feeling of irresponsibility that Allen
Fairfield went into the trial of poor Peter Peeble's suit <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi>
Plainstaines, namely—that there was but little danger of hurting
the case. Any ordinary jury would have acquitted nine cases out
of ten without counsel's instigating them thereto—to say nothing
of the hundred avenues of escape through informalities and
technical points. In fact, criminals were so unskillfully defended in
many instances, that the jury had to acquit in spite of the counsel.
Almost any thing made out a case of self-defence—a threat—
a quarrel—an insult—going armed, as almost all the wild fellows
did—shooting from behind a corner, or out of a store door, in
front or from behind—it was all self-defence! The only skill in the
matter, was in getting the right sort of a jury, which fact could be
easily ascertained, either from the general character of the men, or
from certain discoveries the defendant had been enabled to make
in his mingling among “his friends and the public generally,”—for
they were all, or nearly all, let out on bail or without it. Usually,
the sheriff, too, was a friendly man, and not inclined to omit a
kind service that was likely to be remembered with gratitude at
the next election.</p>
                  <p>The major part of criminal cases, except misdemeanors,
<pb n="59"/>
were for killing, or assaults with intent to kill. They were usually
defended upon points of chivalry. The iron rules of British law
were too tyrannical for free Americans, and too cold and unfeeling
for the hot blood of the sunny south They were denounced
accordingly, and practically scouted from Mississippi judicature,
on the broad ground that they were unsuited to the genius of
American institutions and the American character. There was
nothing technical in this, certainly.</p>
                  <p>But if the case was a hopeless or very dangerous one, there
was another way to get rid of it. “The world was all before” the
culprit “where to choose.” The jails were in such a
condition—generally small log pens—that they held the prisoner
very little better than did the indictment: for the most part, they
held no one but Indians, who had no friend outside who could
help them, and no skill inside to prize out. It was a matter of free
election for the culprit in a desperate case, whether he would
remain in jail or not; and it is astonishing how few exercised their
privilege in favor of staying. The pains of exile seemed to
present no stronger <hi rend="italics">bars</hi> to expatriation, than the jail doors
or windows.</p>
                  <p>The inefficiency of the arresting officers, too, was generally
such that the malefactor could wind up his affairs and leave
before the constable was on his track. If he gave bail, there were
the chances of breaking the bond or recognizance, and the
assurance against injury, derived from the fact that the
recognizors were already broke. </p>
                  <pb n="60"/>
                  <p>The aforesaid leaders carried it with a high hand over us
lawyerlings. If they took nothing by their false clamor, they
certainly lost nothing by sleeping on their rights, or by failing to
claim all they were entitled to. What they couldn't get by asking
the court, they got by sneering and brow-beating. It was pleasant
to watch the countenances of some of them when one of us made
a motion, or took a point, or asked a question of a witness that
they disapproved of. They could sneer like Malgroucher, and
scold like Madame Caudle, and hector like Bully Ajax.</p>
                  <p>We had a goodly youth, a little our senior but more their
junior, a goodly youth from the Republic of South Carolina, Jim
T. by name. The elders had tried his mettle: he wouldn't fag for
them, but stood up to them like a man. When he came to the bar,
Sam J. made a motion at him on the motion docket, requiring him
to produce his original book of entries on the trial or be <hi rend="italics">non suit.</hi>
(He had brought an action of assumpsit on a blacksmith's
account.) When the case was called, Sam demanded whether the
book was in court. Jim told him “No, and it wouldn't be,” and
denied his right to call for it; whereupon, Sam let the motion go,
and suffered Jim T. to go on and prove the account and get the
verdict; a feat worthy of no little praise. Jim was equal to any of
them in law, knowledge and talent, and superior in application
and self-confidence, if that last <hi rend="italics">could</hi> be justly said of mere
humanity. He rode over <hi rend="italics">us</hi> rough-shod, but we forgave him for it
in consideration of his worrying the elders, and standing up to the
rack. He was the best lawyer of his
<pb n="61"/>
age I had ever seen. He had accomplished himself in the elegant
science of special pleading,—had learned all the arts of confusing a
case by all manner of pleas and motions, and took as much interest
in enveloping a plain suit in all the cobwebs of technical defence as
Vidocq ever took in laying snares for a rogue. He could “entangle
justice in such a web of law,” that the blind hussey could have
never found her way out again if Theseus had been there to give
her the clew. His thought by day and his meditation by night, was
special pleas. He loved a demurrer as Domine Dobiensis loved a
pun—with a solemn affection. He could draw a volume of pleas a
night, each one so nearly presenting a regular defence, that there
was scarcely any telling whether it hit it or not. If we replied, ten
to one he demurred to the replication, and would assign fifteen
special causes of demurrer in as many minutes. If we took issue,
we ran an imminent risk of either being caught up on the facts, or
of having the judgment set aside as rendered on an immaterial
issue. It was always dangerous to demur, for the demurrer being
overruled, the defendant was entitled to judgment final. Cases were
triable at the first term, if the writ had been served twenty days
before court. It may be seen, therefore, at a glance, that, with an
overwhelming docket, and without books, or time to consult them
if at hand, and without previous knowledge, we were not reposing
either on a bed of roses or of safety. Jim T. was great on variances,
too. If the note was not described properly in the declaration, we
were sure to catch it before the jury: and, if any point
<pb n="62"/>
could be made on the proofs, he was sure to make it. How we
trembled when we began to read the note to the jury! And how
ominous seemed the words “I object”—of a most cruel and
untimely end about being put to our case. How many cases
where, on a full presentment of the legal merits of them, there was
no presence of a defence, he gained, it is impossible to tell. But if
the ghosts of the murdered victims could now arise, Macbeth
would have had an easy time of it compared with Jim T. How we
admired, envied, feared and hated him! With what a bold,
self-relying air he took his points! With what sarcastic emphasis he
replied to our defences and half defences! We thought that he
knew all the law there was: and when, in a short time, he caught
the old leaders up, we thought if we couldn't be George
Washington, how we should like to be Jim T.</p>
                  <p>He has risen since that time to merited distinction as a ripe
and finished lawyer; yet, “in his noon of fame,” he never so tasted
the luxury of power,—never so knew the bliss of envied and
unapproached preëmenence, as when in the old log court-houses
he was throwing the boys right and left as fast as they came to
him, by pleas dilatory, sham and meritorious, demurrers, motions
and variances. So infallible was his skill in these infernal arts, that
it was almost a tempting of Providence not to employ him.</p>
                  <p>I never thought Jim acted altogether fairly by squire A. The
squire had come to the bar rather late in life, and though an
excellent justice and a sensible man, was not profoundly
versed in the metaphysics of special pleading. He was particularly
<pb n="63"/>
pleased when he got to a jury on ‘a plain note,’ and
particularly annoyed when the road was blocked up by pleas in
abatement and demurrers or special pleas in bar. He had the most
unlimited admiration of Jim. Indeed, he had an awful reverence for
him. He looked up to him as Boswell looked up to Sam Johnson,
or Timothy to Paul. The squire had a note he was anxious to get
judgment on. He had declared with great care and after anxious
deliberation. Not only was the declaration copied from the most
approved precedent, but the common counts were all put in with
all due punctilios, to meet every imaginable phase the case could
assume. Jim found a variance in the count on the note: but how to
get rid of the common counts was the difficulty. He put a bold
face on the matter, however, went up to A. in the court-house,
and threw himself into a passion. “Well,” said he, with freezing
dignity—“I see, sir you have gone and put the common counts in
this declaration—do I understand you to mean them to stand? I
desire to be informed, sir?” “Why, y-e-s, that is, I put 'em there
—but look here, H- , what are you mad at? What's wrong?”
“What's wrong?”—a pretty question! Do you pretend, sir, that
my client ever borrowed any money of yours—that yours ever
paid out money for mine? Did your client ever give you
instructions to sue mine for borrowed money? No, sir, you know
he didn't. Is that endorsed on the writ? No, sir. Don't you know
the statute requires the cause of action to be endorsed on the
<hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">capias ad respondendum?</foreign>
                     </hi> I mean to see whether an action for
a malicious
<pb n="64"/>
suit wouldn't lie for this; and shall move to strike out all
these counts as multifarious and incongruous and heterogeneous.”
“ Well, Jim, don't get mad about it, old fellow—I took it from the
books.” “Yes, from the English books—but didn't you know we
don't govern ourselves by the British statute?—if you don't, I'll
instruct you.” “Now ,” said A., “Jim, hold on—all I want is a
fair trial—if you will let me go to the jury, I'll strike out these
common counts.” “Well,” said Jim, “<hi rend="italics">I will this time</hi>, as it is
you; but let this be a warning to you, A., how you get to suing
my clients on promiscuous, and fictitious, and pretensed causes
of action.”
Accordingly they joined issue on the count in chief—A.
offered to read his note—H. objected—it was voted out, and A.
was nonsuited. “Now,” said Jim, “that is 
doing the thing in the
regular way. See how pleasant it is to get on with business when
the rules are observed!”

               <div type="subchapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                  <p>The case of most interest at the fall term of N-e court,
1837, was the State of Mississippi <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Major Foreman, charged
with assault with intent to kill one Tommy Peabody, a Yankee
schoolmaster in the neighborhood of M-ville. The District
Attorney being absent, the court appointed J.T. to prosecute.
All the preliminary motions and points of order having been
gone through, and having failed of success, the defendant
had to go to trial before the jury. The defendant being a warm
democrat, selected T.M., the then leader of that party, and
Washington B.T., then a rising light of the same political sect,
to defend him. The evidence was not
<pb n="65"/>
very clear or positive. It seemed that an altercation had arisen at
the grocery (fashionably called doggery), between a son of the
defendant and the schoolmaster, which led to the shooting of the
pistol by the younger F. at the aforesaid Thomas, as the said
Thomas was making his way with equal regard to speed of transit
and safety of conveyance from that locality. As it was Thomas's
business to teach the young idea to shoot, he had no idea of
putting to hazard “the delightful task” by being shot himself: and
by thinking him of “what troubles do environ the man that
meddles with cold iron” on the drawing thereof, resolved himself
into a committee of safety, and proceeded energetically to the
dispatch of the appropriate business of the board. But fast as
Thomas travelled, a bevy of mischievous buckshot, as full of
devilment as Thomas's scholars just escaped from school, rushed
after, and one of them, striking him about two feet above the calf
of his right leg, made his seat on the scholastic tripod for a while
rather unpleasant to him. In fact, Thomas suffered a good deal in
that particular region in which he had been the cause of much
suffering in others. Thomas also added to the fun naturally
attaching, in the eyes of the mercurial and reckless population of
the time, to a Yankee schoolmaster's being shot while running, in
so tender a point, by clapping his hands behind at the fire, and
bellowing out that the murderer had blown out his brains! A
mistake very pardonable in one who had come fresh from a
country where pistols were not known, and who could not be
expected, under these distressing circumstances, to estimate, with
much precision, the effect of a gun-shot wound.</p>
                  <pb n="66"/>
                  <p>Young Foreman, immediately after the pistol went off,
followed its example. And not being of a curious turn, did not come
back to see what the sheriff had done with a document he had for
him, though assured that it related to important business. The
proof against him—as it usually was against any one who couldn't
be hurt by it—was clear enough, but it was not so much so against
his father. The Major was there, had participated in the quarrel,
and about the time of the firing, a voice the witness took—but
wasn't certain—to be the Major's, was heard to cry out, “Shoot!
Shoot!” and, shortly after the firing, the Major was heard to
halloo to Peabody, “Run—Run, you d-d rascal—run!” This was
about the strength of the testimony. The Major was a gentleman of
about fifty-five—of ruddy complexion, which he had got out of a
jug he kept under his bed of cold nights, without acknowledging
his obligations for the loan—about five feet eight inches high and
nearly that much broad. Nature or accident had shortened one leg,
so that he limped when he walked. His eyes stood out and were
streaked like a boy's white alley—and he wore a ruffled shirt; the
same, perhaps, which he had worn on training days in Georgia, but
which did not match very well with a yellow linsey vest, and a pair
of copperas-colored jeans pantaloons he had squeezed in the form
of a crescent over his protuberant paunch: on the whole, he was a
pretty good live parody on an enormous goggle-eyed sun perch.</p>
                  <p>He had come from Georgia, where he had been a major in the
militia, if that is not tautology; for I believe that
<pb n="67"/>
every men that ever comes from Georgia <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a major,—repaying
the honor of the commission or title by undeviating fidelity to the
democratic ticket. He would almost as soon been convicted as to
have been successfully defended by a whig lawyer.</p>
                  <p>Old F. held up his head for some time—indeed, seemed to
enjoy the mirth that was going on during the testimony, very
much. But when J.T. began to pour broadside after broadside into
him, and bring up fact after fact and appeal after appeal, and the
court-house grew still and solemn, the old fellow could stand it no
longer. Like the Kentucky militia at New Orleans, he ingloriously
fled, sneaking out when no one was looking at him. The sheriff,
however, soon missed him, and seeing him crossing the bridge and
moving towards the swamp, raised a <hi rend="italics">posse</hi> and followed after. The
trial in the mean time proceeded—as did the Major.</p>
                  <p>I said he was defended in part by W.B.T.</p>
                  <p>You didn't know Wash? Well, you missed a good deal. He
would have impressed you. He was about thirty years old at the
time I am writing of. He came to N. from East Tennessee, among
whose romantic mountains he had “beat the drum ecclesiastic” as
a Methodist preacher. He had, however, doffed the cassock, or
rather, the shad-belly, for the gown. He had fallen from grace—
not a high fall—and having warred against the devil for a time
—a quarter or more—Dalgetty-like, he got him a law license,
and took arms on the other side. His mind was not cramped, nor his
originality fettered by technical rules or other learning.
<pb n="68"/>
His voice, had not affectation injured the effect of it, was
remarkably fine, full, musical and sonorous, and of any degree of
compass and strength. He was as fluent of words as a Frenchman.
He was never known to falter for a word,
<corr>a</corr>nd if he ever paused for an idea, he paused in vain. He practised
on his voice as on an organ, and had as many ups and downs, high
keys and low, as many gyrations and windings as an opera singer
or a stage horn. H. G-y used to say of him that he just shined his
eyes, threw up his arms, twirled his tongue, opened his mouth,
and left the consequences to heaven. He practised on the
injunction to the apostles, and took no thought what he should
say, but spoke without labor—mental or physical. To add to the
charms of his delivery, he wore a poppaw smile, a sort of
sickly-sweet expression on his countenance, that worked like Dover's
powders on the spectator.</p>
                  <p>After J.T. had concluded his opening speech, Washington
rose to open for the defence. The speech was a remarkable
specimen of forensic eloquence. It had all the charms of Counsellor
Phillips' most ornate efforts, lacking only the ideas. Great was the
sensation when Wash. turned upon the prosecutor. “Gentlemen of
the jury,” said the orator, “this prosecutor is one of the vilest
ingrates that ever lived since the time of Judas Iscariot; for,
gentlemen, did you not hear from the witnesses, that when this
prosecutor was in the very extremity of his peril, my client,
moved by the tenderest emotions of pity and compassion,
shouted out, <corr>‘</corr>Run! run! you d-d rascal—run!’ It is true (lowering
<pb n="69"/>
his voice and smiling), gentlemen, he said ‘you d-d rascal,’
but the honorable court will instruct you that that was merely
<hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">descriptio personae</foreign>.</hi>” The effect was prodigious.</p>
                  <p>After Washington had made an end, old Tallabola rose slowly,
as if oppressed by the weight of his subject. Now T. never made a
jury speech without telling an anecdote. Whatever else was omitted
the anecdote had to come. It is true, the point and application were
both sometimes hard to see; and it is also true that as T's stock was
by no means extensive, he had to make up in repetition what he
lacked in variety. He had, however, one stand-by which never
failed him. He might be said to have chartered it. He had told it
until it had got to be a necessity of speech. The anecdote was a
relation of a Georgia major's prowess in war. It ran thus: The major
was very brave when the enemy was at a distance, and exhorted his
men to fight to the death;—the enemy came nearer—the major told
his soldiers to fight bravely, but to be prudent;—the foe came in
sight, their arms gleaming in the sunshine—and the major told the
men that, if they could not do better, they ought to retreat; and
added he, “being a little lame, I believe I will leave now.” And so,
said T., it was with the prosecutor. At length after a long speech,
T. concluded. J.T. rose to reply. He said, before proceeding to the
argument, he would pay his respects to his old acquaintance, the
anecdote of the Georgia major. He had known it a long while,
indeed almost as long as he had known his friend T. It had
afforded him amusement for many courts—how many he
<pb n="70"/>
couldn't now stop to count. Knowing the major to have been
drafted into Mr. T's speeches for many a campaign, he had hoped
the war-worn veteran had been discharged from duty and
pensioned off, in consideration of long and hard usage, or at least,
that he was resting on furlough; but it seems he was still in active
service. His friend had not been very happy in his anecdote on
other occasions, but, he must say, on this occasion he was most
<hi rend="italics">felicitously unhappy</hi>; for the DEFENDANT was a major—he was a
Georgia major too; unfortunately, he was a little lame also; and, to
complete the parallel, “in the heat of <hi rend="italics">this</hi> action, on looking
around,” said J.T., “I find he has left!” T. jumped up—“No
evidence of that, Mr. H. Confine yourself to the record, if you
please.” “Well,” said J.T., 
“gentlemen, my friend is a little restive.
You may look around, and judge for yourselves.”
 Tallabola never
told that anecdote any more;—he had to get another.</p>
                  <p>The jury having been sufficiently confused as to the law by which
about twenty abstract propositions bearing various, and some of them
no relation to the facts (the legislature, in its excessive veneration 
for the sanctity of jury trial having prohibited the judges from
charging in an intelligible way), retired from the bar to consider of
their verdict. In a few moments they returned into court. But where was
the prisoner? Like Lara, he wouldn't come. The court refused to
 receive the verdict in the absence of the defendant. Finally, after waiting a
long while, the Major was brought, an officer holding on to each arm,
and a crowd following at
<pb n="71"/>
his heels. (The Major had been caught in the swamp.) When he
came in, he thought he was a gone sucker. The court directed the
clerk to call over the jury: they were called, and severally
answered to their names. The perspiration rolled from the
Major's face—his eyes stuck out as if he had been choked. At the
end of the call, the judge asked “Are you agreed on your verdict?”
The foreman answered “Yes,” and handed to the clerk the
indictment on which the verdict was endorsed. The clerk read it
slowly. “We—the jury—find the—de—fen—dant (the Major
held his breath) <hi rend="italics">not</hi> guilty.” One moment more and he had fainted.
He breathed easy, then uttering a sort of relieving groan shortly
after, he came to Tallabola —“Tal,” said he, blubbering and wiping
his nose on his cuff, “I'm going to quit the dimmycratic party and
jine the whigs.” “Why, Major,” said Tal, 
“what do you mean? You'reou're one of our chief spokes at your box. Don't you believe in
our doctrines?” “Yes,” said the Major, 
“I do; but after my
disgraceful run I'm not fit to be a dimmycrat any longer—I'd
disgrace the party—and am no better than a dratted, blue-bellied,
federal whig!”</p>

            <head>HOW THE TIMES SERVED THE VIRGINIANS.
VIRGINIANS IN A NEW COUNTRY. THE RISE,
DECLINE, AND FALL OF THE RAG EMPIRE.</head>
            <p>THE disposition to be proud and vain of one's country, and to
boast of it, is a natural feeling, indulged or not in respect to the
pride, vanity, and boasting, according to the character of the
native: but, with a Virginian, it is a passion. It inheres in him even
as the flavor of a York river oyster in that bivalve, and no
distance of deportation, and no trimmings of a gracious
prosperity, and no pickling in the sharp acids of adversity, can
destroy it. It is a part of the Virginia character—just as the
flavor is a distinctive part of the oyster—“which cannot, save by
annihilating, die.” It is no use talking about it—the thing may be
right, or wrong:—like Falstaff's victims at Gadshill, it is past
praying for: it is a sort of cocoa grass that has got into the soil,
and has so matted over it, and so <hi rend="italics">fibred</hi> through it, as to have
become a part of it; at least, there is no telling which is the grass
and which is the soil; and certainly it is useless
<pb n="73"/>
labor to try to root it out. You may destroy the soil, but you
can't root out the grass.</p>
            <p>Patriotism with a Virginian is a noun personal. It is the
Virginian himself and something over. He loves Virginia <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">propter se</hi>: he loves her for herself and for himself—because
<hi rend="italics">she is</hi> Virginia and—every thing else beside. He loves to talk
about her: out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
It makes no odds where he goes, he carries Virginia with him; not
in the entirety always—but the little spot he came from is
Virginia—as Swedenborg says the smallest part of the brain is an
abridgment of all of it. “<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Coelum non animum mutant qui
trans mare currunt</foreign>,</hi>” was made for a Virginian. He never gets
acclimated elsewhere; he never loses citizenship to the old Home.
The right of expatriation is a pure abstraction to him. He may
breathe in Alabama, but he lives in Virginia. His treasure is there,
and his heart also. If he looks at the Delta of the Mississippi, it
reminds him of James River “low grounds;” if he sees the vast
prairies of Texas, it is a memorial of the meadows of the Valley.
Richmond is the centre of attraction, the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">depot</foreign>
               </hi> of all that is
grand, great, good and glorious. “It is the Kentucky of a place,”
which the preacher described Heaven to be to the Kentucky
congregation.</p>
            <p>Those who came many years ago from the borough towns,
especially from the vicinity of Williamsburg, exceed, in
attachment to their birthplace, if possible, the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">emigrés</foreign>
               </hi> from the
metropolis. It is refreshing in these costermonger times,
<pb n="74"/>
to hear them speak of it:—they remember it when the old burg
was the seat of fashion, taste, refinement, hospitality, wealth, wit,
and all social graces; when genius threw its spell over the public
assemblages and illumined the halls of justice, and when beauty
brightened the social hour with her unmatched and matchless brilliancy.</p>
            <p>Then the spirited and gifted youths of the College of old
William and Mary, some of them just giving out the first
scintillations of the genius that afterwards shone refulgent in the
forum and the senate, added to the attractions of a society gay,
cultivated and refined beyond example—<hi rend="italics">even</hi> in the Old
Dominion. A hallowed charm seems to rest upon the venerable
city, clothing its very dilapidation in a drapery of romance and of
serene and classic interest: as if all the sweet and softened
splendor which invests the “Midsummer Night's Dream” were
poured in a flood of mellow and poetic radiance over the now
quiet and half “deserted village.” There is something in the
shadow from the old college walls, cast by the moon upon the
grass and sleeping on the sward, that throws a like shadow soft,
sad and melancholy upon the heart of the returning pilgrim who
saunters out to view again, by moonlight, his old <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Alma Mater</foreign>
               </hi>—
the nursing mother of such a list and such a line of statesmen and
heroes.</p>
            <p>There is nothing presumptuously forward in this
Virginianism. The Virginian does not make broad his
phylacteries and crow over the poor Carolinian and
Tennesseeian. He does not reproach him with his misfortune of
birthplace.
<pb n="75"/>
No, he thinks the affliction is enough without the triumph. The
franchise of having been born in Virginia, and the prerogative
founded thereon, are too patent of honor and distinction to be
arrogantly pretended. The bare mention is enough. He finds
occasion to let the fact be known, and then the fact is fully able to
protect and take care of itself. Like a ducal title, there is no need
of saying more than to name it: modesty then is a becoming and
expected virtue; forbearance to boast is true dignity.</p>
            <p>The Virginian is a magnanimous man. He never throws up to
a Yankee the fact of his birthplace. He feels on the subject as a
man of delicacy feels in alluding to a rope in the presence of a
person, one of whose brothers “stood upon nothing and kicked
at the U.S.,” or to a female indiscretion, where there had been
scandal concerning the family. So far do they carry this
refinement, that I have known one of my countrymen, on
occasion of a Bostonian owning where he was born, generously
protest that he had never heard of it before. As if honest
confession half obliterated the shame of the fact. Yet he does not
lack the grace to acknowledge worth or merit in another, wherever
the native place of that other: for it is a common thing to hear
them say of a neighbor, “he is a clever fellow, <hi rend="italics">though</hi> he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> come
from New Jersey or even Connecticut.”</p>
            <p>In politics the Virginian is learned much beyond what is
written—for they have heard a great deal of speaking on that
prolific subject, especially by one or two Randolphs and any
number of Barbours. They read the same papers here they
<pb n="76"/>
read in Virginia—the <hi rend="italics">Richmond Enquirer</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Richmond Whig.</hi>
The democrat stoutly asseverates a fact, and gives <hi rend="italics">the Enquirer</hi> as
his authority with an air that means to say, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> settles it: while
the whig quoted Hampden Pleasants with the same confidence.
But the faculty of personalizing every thing which the exceeding
social turn of a Virginian gives him, rarely allowed
a reference to
the paper, <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">eo
nomine</foreign>
               </hi>; but made him refer to the
editor: as “Ritchie
said” so and so, or “Hampden Pleasants
said” this or that. When
two of opposite politics got together, it was amusing, if you had
nothing else to do that day, to hear the discussion. I never knew a
debate that did not start <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">ab
urbe condita</foreign>
               </hi>. They not only went back
to first principles, but also to first times; nor did I ever hear a
discussion in which old John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did not
figure—as if an interminable dispute had been going on for so
many generations between those disputatious personages; as if the
quarrel had begun before time, but was not to end with it. But the
strangest part of it to me was, that the dispute seemed to be going
on without poor Adams having any defence or champion; and
never waxed hotter than when both parties agreed in denouncing
the man of Braintree as the worst of public sinners and the vilest
of political heretics. They both agreed on one thing, and that was
to refer the matter to the Resolutions of 1798-99; which said
Resolutions, like Goldsmith's “Good Natured Man,”
arbitrating
between Mr. and Mrs. Croaker, seemed so impartial that they
agreed with both parties on every occasion.</p>
            <pb n="77"/>
            <p>Nor do I recollect of hearing any question debated that did not
resolve itself into a question of constitution—strict construction,
&amp;c.,—the constitution being a thing of that curious virtue that its
chief excellency consisted in not allowing the government to do any
thing; or in being a regular prize fighter that knocked all laws and
legislators into a cocked hat, except those of the objector's party.</p>
            <p>Frequent reference was reciprocally made to “gorgons,
hydras, and chimeras dire,” to black cockades, blue lights, Essex
juntos, the Reign of Terror, and some other mystic entities—but
who or what these monsters were, I never could distinctly learn;
and was surprised, on looking into the history of the country, to
find that, by some strange oversight, no allusion was made to
them.</p>
            <p>Great is the Virginian's reverence of great men, that is to say,
of great Virginians. This reverence is not Unitarian. He is a
Polytheist. He believes in a multitude of Virginia Gods. As the
Romans of every province and village had their tutelary or other
divinities, besides having divers national gods, so the Virginian of
every county has his great man, the like of whom cannot be found
in the new country he has exiled himself to. This sentiment of
veneration for talent, especially for speaking talent,—this amiable
propensity to lionize men, is not peculiar to any class of
Virginians among us: it abides in all. I was amused to hear “old
Culpepper,” as we call him (by nickname derived from the
county he came from), declaiming in favor of the Union. “What,
gentlemen,” said the old man, with a sonorous swell—“what,
<pb n="78"/>
burst up this glorious Union! and who, if <hi rend="italics">this</hi> Union is torn up,
could write another? Nobody except Henry Clay and J- S. B-,
of Culpepper—and may be <hi rend="italics">they</hi> wouldn't—and what then
would you do for another?”</p>
            <p>The greatest compliment a Virginian can ever pay to a speaker,
is to say that he reminds him of a Col. Broadhorn or a Captain
Smith, who represented some royal-named county some forty
years or less in the Virginia House of Delegates; and of whom, the
auditor, of course, has heard, as he made several speeches in the
capitol at Richmond. But the force of the compliment is somewhat
broken, by a long narrative, in which the personal reminiscences of
the speaker go back to sundry stretches of the Virginia statesman's
efforts, and recapitulations of his sayings, interspersed <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">par
parenthèse</foreign>
               </hi>, with many valuable notes illustrative of his pedigree
and performances; the whole of which, given with great historical
fidelity of detail, leaves nothing to be wished for except the point,
or rather, two points, the gist and the period.</p>
            <p>It is not to be denied that Virginia is the land of orators,
heroes and statesmen; and that, directly or indirectly, she has
exerted an influence upon the national councils nearly as great as
all the rest of the States combined. It is wonderful that a State of
its size and population should have turned out such an
unprecedented quantum of talent, and of talent as various in kind
as prodigious in amount. She has reason to be proud; and the
other States so largely in her debt (for, from Cape May to Puget's
Sound she has colonized the other States and the territories with
her surplus talent,) ought to
<pb n="79"/>
allow her the harmless privilege of a little bragging. In the showy
talent of oratory has she especially shone. To accomplish her in
this art the State has been turned into a debating society, and
while she has been <hi rend="italics">talking</hi> for the benefit of the nation, as she
thought, the other, and, by nature, less favored States, have been
<hi rend="italics">doing</hi> for their own. Consequently, what she has gained in
reputation, she has lost in wealth and <hi rend="italics">material aids</hi>. Certainly the
Virginia character has been less distinguished for its practical than
its ornamental traits, and for its business qualities than for its
speculative temper. <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Cui bono</foreign>
               </hi> and utilitarianism, at least until
latterly, were not favorite or congenial inquiries and subjects of
attention to the Virginia politician. What the Virginian was upon
his native soil, that he was abroad; indeed, it may be said that the
<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">amor patriae</foreign>
               </hi>, strengthened by absence, made him more of a
conservative abroad than he would have been if he had staid at
home; for most of them here would not, had they been consulted,
have changed either of the old constitutions.</p>
            <p>It is far, however, from my purpose to treat of such themes. I
only glance at them to show their influence on the character as it
was developed on a new theatre.</p>
            <p>Eminently social and hospitable, kind, humane and generous
is a Virginian, at home or abroad. They are so by nature and habit.
These qualities and their exercise develop and strengthen other
virtues. By reason of these social traits, they necessarily become
well mannered, honorable, spirited, and careful of reputation,
desirous of pleasing, and
<pb n="80"/>
skilled in the accomplishments which please. Their insular
position and sparse population, mostly rural, and easy but not
affluent fortunes kept them from the artificial refinements and the
strong temptations which corrupt so much of the society of the
old world and some portions of the new. There was no character
more attractive than that of a young Virginian, fifteen years ago, of
intelligence, of good family, education and breeding.</p>
            <p>It was of the instinct of a Virginian to seek society: he belongs
to the gregarious, not to the solitary division of animals; and
society can only be kept up by grub and gab—something to eat,
and, if not something to talk about, talk. Accordingly they came
accomplished already in the knowledge and the talent for these
important duties.</p>
            <p>A Virginian could always get up a good dinner. He could also
do his share—a full hand's work—in disposing of one after it was
got up. The qualifications for hostmanship were signal—the old
Udaller himself, assisted by Claud Halrco, could not do up the
thing in better style, or with a heartier relish, or a more cordial
hospitality. In <hi rend="italics">petite</hi> manners—the little attentions of the table,
the filling up of the chinks of the conversation with small fugitive
observations, the supplying the hooks and eyes that <hi rend="italics'">kept</hi> the
discourse together, the genial good humor, which, like that of the
family of the good Vicar, made up in laughter what was wanting in
wit—in these, and in the science of getting up and in getting
through a picnic or chowder party, or fish fry, the Virginian, like
Eclipse, was first, and there was no second.
<pb n="81"/>
Great was he too at mixing an apple toddy, or mint julep,
where ice could be got for love or money; and not deficient, by
any means, when it came to his turn to do honor to his own
fabrics. It was in this department, that he not only shone but
<hi rend="italics">out</hi>shone, not merely all others but himself. Here he was at home
indeed. His elocution, his matter, his learning, his education, were
of the first order. He could discourse of every thing around him
with an accuracy and a fulness which would have put Coleridge's
or Mrs. Ellis's table talk to the blush. Every dish was a text,
horticulture, hunting, poultry, fishing—(Isaac Walton or Daniel
Webster would have been charmed and instructed to hear him
discourse piscatory-wise,)—a slight divergence in favor of
fox-chasing and a detour towards a horse-race now and then, and
continual parentheses of recommendation of particular dishes or
glasses—Oh! I tell you if ever there was an interesting man it was
he. Others might be agreeable, but he was fascinating,
irresistible, not-to-be-done-without.</p>
            <p>In the fulness of time the new era had set in—the era of the
second great experiment of independence: the experiment, namely,
of credit without capital, and enterprise without honesty. The
Age of Brass had succeeded the Arcadian period when men got
rich by saving a part of their earnings, and lived at their own
cost and in ignorance of the new plan of making fortunes on the
profits of what they owed. A new theory, not found in the works
on political economy, was broached.  It was found out that the
prejudice in favor of the metals (brass excluded) was an
absurd superstition;
<pb n="82"/>
and that, in reality, any thing else, which the parties interested in
giving it currency chose, might serve as a representative of value
and medium for exchange of property; and as gold and silver had
served for a great number of years as representatives, the
republican doctrine of rotation in office required they should give
way. Accordingly it was decided that Rags, a very familiar
character, and very popular and easy of access, should take their
place. Rags belonged to the school of progress. He was
representative of the then Young America. His administration was
not tame. It was <hi rend="italics">very</hi> spirited. It was based on the Bonapartist
idea of keeping the imagination of the people excited. The leading
fiscal idea of his system was to <hi rend="italics">democratize</hi> capital, and to make,
for all purposes of trade, credit and enjoyment of wealth, the man
that had <hi rend="italics">no</hi> money a little richer, if any thing, than the man that
had a million. The principle of success and basis of operation,
though inexplicable in the hurry of the time, is plain enough now: it
was faith. Let the public believe that a smutted rag is money, it is
money: in other words; it was a sort of financial biology, which
made, at night, the thing conjured for, the thing that was seen, so
far as the patient was concerned, while the fit was on him—except
that now a man does not do his trading when under the mesmeric
influence: in the flush times he did.</p>
            <p>This country was just settling up. Marvellous accounts had
gone forth of the fertility of its virgin lands; and the productions
of the soil were commanding a price remunerating to slave labor
as it had never been remunerated before.
<pb n="83"/>
Emigrants came flocking in from all quarters of the Union,
especially from the slaveholding States. The new country seemed
to be a reservoir, and every road leading to it a vagrant stream of
enterprise and adventure. Money, or what passed for money, was
the only cheap thing to be had. Every cross-road and every
avocation presented an opening,—through which a fortune was
seen by the adventurer in near perspective. Credit was a thing of
course. To refuse it—if the thing was ever done—were an insult
for which a bowie-knife were not a too summary or exemplary a
means of redress. The State banks were issuing their bills by the
sheet, like a patent steam printing-press <hi rend="italics">its</hi> issues; and no other
showing was asked of the applicant for the loan than an
authentication of his great distress for money. Finance, even in its
most exclusive quarter, had thus already got, in this wonderful
revolution, to work upon the principles of the charity hospital.
If an overseer grew tired of supervising a plantation and felt a call
to the mercantile life, even if he omitted the compendious method
of buying out a merchant wholesale, stock, house and good will,
and laying down, at once, his bull-whip for the yard-stick—all he
had to do was to go on to New-York, and present himself in
Pearlstreet with a letter avouching his citizenship, and a clean
shirt, and he was regularly given a through ticket to speedy
bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>Under this stimulating process prices rose like smoke. Lots in
obscure villages were held at city prices; lands, bought at the
minimum cost of government, were sold at
<pb n="84"/>
from thirty to forty dollars per acre, and considered dirt cheap at
that. In short, the country had got to be a full ante-type of
California, in all except the gold. Society was wholly unorganized:
there was no restraining public opinion: the law was well-nigh
powerless—and religion scarcely was heard of except as
furnishing the oaths and <hi rend="italics">technics</hi> of profanity. The world saw a
fair experiment of what it would have been, if the fiat had never
been pronounced which decreed subsistence as the price of labor.</p>
            <p>Money, got without work, by those unaccustomed to it,
turned the heads of its possessors, and they spent it with a
recklessness like that with which they gained it. The pursuits of
industry neglected, riot and coarse debauchery filled up the vacant
hours. “Where the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered
together;” and the eagles that flocked to the Southwest, were of
the same sort as the <hi rend="italics">black eagles</hi> the Duke of Saxe-Weimar saw on
his celebrated journey to the Natural Bridge. “The cankers of a
long peace and a calm world”—there were no Mexican wars and
filibuster expeditions in those days—gathered in the villages and
cities by scores.</p>
            <p>Even the little boys caught the taint of the general infection
of morals; and I knew one of them—Jim Ellett by name—to give
a man ten dollars to hold him up to bet at the table of a faro-bank.
James was a fast youth; and I sincerely hope he may not fulfil
his early promise, and some day be <hi rend="italics">assisted up still higher</hi>.</p>
            <p>The groceries—<hi rend="italics">vulgice</hi>—doggeries, were in full blast in
<pb n="85"/>
those days, no village having less than a half-dozen all busy all the
time: gaming and horse racing were polite and well patronized
amusements. I knew of a Judge to adjourn two courts (or court
twice) to attend a horse-race, at which he officiated judicially and
ministerially, and with more appropriateness than in the judicial
chair. Occasionally the scene was diversified by a murder or two,
which though perpetrated from behind a corner, or behind the back
of the deceased, whenever the accused <hi rend="italics">chose</hi> to stand his trial,
was always found to be committed in self-defence, securing the
homicide an honorable acquittal <hi rend="italics">at the hands of his peers</hi>.</p>
            <p>The old rules of business and the calculations of prudence
were alike disregarded, and profligacy, in all the departments of
the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">crimen falsi</foreign>
               </hi>, held riotous carnival. Larceny grew not only
respectable, but genteel, and ruffled it in all the pomp of purple
and fine linen. Swindling was raised to the dignity of the fine arts.
Felony came forth from its covert, put on more seemly
habiliments, and took its seat with unabashed front in the
upper places of the synagogue. Before the first circles of the
patrons of this brilliant and dashing villainy, Blunt Honesty felt
as abashed as poor Halbert Glendinning by the courtly refinement
and supercilious airs of Sir Piercie Shafton.</p>
            <p>Public office represented, by its incumbents, the state of
public morals with some approach to accuracy. Out of sixty-six
receivers of public money in the new States, sixty-two were
discovered to be defaulters; and the agent, sent to look into
the affairs of a peccant office-holder in the
<pb n="86"/>
South-West, reported him <hi rend="italics">minus</hi> some tens of thousands, but
advised the government to retain him, for a reason one of Aesop's
fables illustrates: the agent ingeniously surmising that the
appointee succeeding would do his stealing without any regard to
the proficiency already made by his predecessor; while the
present incumbent would probably consider, in mercy to the
treasury, that he <hi rend="italics">had</hi> done <hi rend="italics">something</hi> of the pious duty of
providing for his household.</p>
            <p>There was no petit larceny: there was all the difference
between stealing by the small and the “operations” manipulated,
that there is between a single assassination and an hundred
thousand men killed in an opium war. The placeman robbed with
the gorgeous magnificence of a Governor-General of Bengal.</p>
            <p>The man of straw, not worth the buttons on his shirt, with a
sublime audacity, bought lands and negroes, and provided times
and terms of payment which a Wall-street capitalist would have
to re-cast his arrangements to meet.</p>
            <p>Oh, Paul Clifford and Augustus Tomlinson, philosophers of
the road, practical and theoretical! if ye had lived to see those
times, how great an improvement on your ruder scheme of
distribution would these gentle arts have seemed; arts whereby,
without risk, or loss of character, or the vulgar barbarism of
personal violence, the same beneficial results flowed with no
greater injury to the superstitions of moral education!</p>
            <p>With the change of times and the imagination of wealth
easily acquired came a change in the thoughts and habits of the
people. “Old times were changed—old manners gone.”
<pb n="87"/>
Visions of affluence, such as crowded Dr. Samuel Johnson's mind,
when advertising a sale of Thrale's Brewery, and casting a soft
sheep's eye towards Thrale's widow, thronged upon the popular
fancy. Avarice and hope joined partnership. It was strange how the
reptile arts of humanity, as at a faro table, warmed into life beneath
their heat. The <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">cacoethes accrescendi</foreign>
               </hi> became epidemic. It seized
upon the universal community. The pulpits even were not safe from
its insidious invasion. What men anxiously desire they willingly
believe; and all believed a good time was coming—had come.</p>
            <p>“Commerce was king”—and Rags, Tag and Bobtail his cabinet
council. Rags was treasurer. Banks, chartered on a specie basis, did
a very flourishing business on the promissory notes of the
individual stockholders ingeniously substituted in lieu of cash.
They issued ten for one, the <hi rend="italics">one</hi> being fictitious. They generously
loaned all the directors could not use themselves, and were not
choice whether Bardolph was the endorser for Falstaff, or Falstaff
borrowed on his own proper credit, or the funds advanced him by
Shallow. The stampede towards the golden temple became general:
the delusion prevailed far and wide that this thing was not a
burlesque on commerce and finance. Even the directors of the
banks began to have their doubts whether the intended swindle
was not a failure. Like Lord Clive, when reproached for extortion
to the extent of some millions in Bengal, they exclaimed, after the
bubble burst, “When they thought of what they had got, and what
they might have got, they were astounded at their own
moderation.”</p>
            <pb n="88"/>
            <p>The old capitalists for a while stood out. With the Tory
conservatism of cash in hand, worked for, they couldn't reconcile
their old notions to the new regime. They looked for the thing's
ending, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> their time. But the stampede still kept on. Paper
fortunes still multiplied—houses and lands changed hands—real
estate see-sawed up as morals went down on the other end of the
plank—men of straw, corpulent with bank bills, strutted past
them on 'Change. They began, too, to think there might be
something in this new thing. Peeping cautiously, like hedge-hogs
out of their holes, they saw the stream of wealth and adventurers
passing by—then, looking carefully around, they inched
themselves half way out—then, sallying forth and snatching up a
morsel, ran back, until at last, grown more bold, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> ran out
too with their hoarded store, in full chase with the other unclean
beasts of adventure. They never got back again. Jonah's gourd
withered one night, and next morning the vermin that had nestled
under its broad shade were left unprotected, a prey to the swift
retribution that came upon them. They were left naked, or only
clothed themselves with cursing (the Specie Circular on the
United States Bank) as with a garment. To drop the figure:
Shylock himself couldn't live in those times, so reversed was
every thing. Shaving paper and loaning money at a usury of fifty
per cent, was for the first time since the Jews left Jerusalem, a
breaking business to the operator.</p>
            <p>The condition of society may be imagined:—vulgarity—
ignorance—fussy and arrogant pretension—unmitigated rowdyism
<pb n="89"/>
—bullying insolence, if they did not rule the hour, <hi rend="italics">seemed</hi> to
wield unchecked dominion. The workings of these choice spirits
were patent upon the face of society; and the modest,
unobtrusive, retiring men of worth and character (for there were
many, perhaps a large majority of such) were almost lost sight of
in the hurry-burly of those strange and shifting scenes.</p>
            <p>Even in the professions were the same characteristics visible.
Men dropped down into their places as from the clouds. Nobody
knew who or what they were, except as they claimed, or as a
surface view of their characters indicated. Instead of taking to the
highway and magnanimously calling upon the wayfarer to stand
and deliver, or to the fashionable larceny of credit without
prospect or design of paying, some unscrupulous horse-doctor
would set up his sign as “Physician and Surgeon,” and draw his
lances on you, or fire at random a box of his pills into your
bowels, with a vague chance of hitting some disease unknown to
him, but with a better prospect of killing the patient, whom or
whose administrator he charged some ten dollars a trial for his
markmanship.</p>
            <p>A superannuated justice or constable in one of the old States
was metamorphosed into a lawyer; and though he knew not the
distinction between a <hi rend="italics">fee tail</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">female</hi>, would undertake to
construe, off-hand, a will involving all the subtleties of <hi rend="italics">uses and
trusts</hi>.</p>
            <p>But this state of things could not last for ever: society
cannot always stand on its head with its heels in the air.</p>
            <pb n="90"/>
            <p>The Jupiter Tonans of the White House saw the monster of
a free credit prowling about like a beast of apocalyptic vision, and
marked him for his prey. Gathering all his bolts in his sinewy
grasp, and standing back on his heels, and waving his wiry arm, he
let them all fly, hard and swift upon all the hydra's heads. Then
came a crash, as “if the ribs of nature broke,” and a scattering, like
the bursting of a thousand magazines, and a smell of brimstone, as
if Pandemonium had opened a window next to earth for
ventilation,—and all was silent. The beast never stirred in his
tracks. To get down from the clouds to level ground, the Specie
Circular was issued without warning, and the splendid lie of a false
credit burst into fragments. It came in the midst of the dance and
the frolic—as Tam O'Shanter came to disturb the infernal glee of
the warlocks, and to disperse the rioters. Its effect was like that of
a general creditor's bill in the chancery court, and a marshalling of
all the assets of the trades-people. Gen. Jackson was no fairy; but
he did some very pretty fairy work, in converting the bank bills
back again into rags and oak-leaves. Men worth a million were
insolvent for two millions: promising young cities marched back
again into the wilderness. The ambitious town plat was re-annexed
to the plantation, like a country girl taken home from the city. The
frolic was ended, and what headaches, and feverish limbs the next
morning! The retreat from Moscow was performed over again, and
“Devil take the hindmost” was the tune to which the soldiers of
fortune marched. The only question was as to the means of
escape,
<pb n="91"/>
and the nearest and best route to Texas. The sheriff was as busy
as a militia adjutant on review day; and the lawyers were mere
wreckers, earning salvage. Where are ye now my ruffling gallants?
Where now the braw cloths and watch chains and rings and fine
horses? Alas! for ye—they are glimmering among the things that
were—the wonder of an hour! They live only in memory, as
unsubstantial as the promissory notes ye gave for them. When it
came to be tested, the whole matter was found to be hollow and
fallacious. Like a sum ciphered out through a long column, the
first figure an error, the whole, and all the parts were wrong,
throughout the entire calculation.</p>
            <p>Such is a charcoal sketch of the interesting region—now
inferior to none in resources, and the character of its
population—during the FLUSH TIMES; a period constituting an
episode in the commercial history of the world—the reign of
humbug, and wholesale insanity, just overthrown in time to save
the whole country from ruin. But while it lasted, many of our
countrymen came into the South-West in time to get “a benefit.”
The <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">auri sacra fames</foreign>
               </hi> is a catching disease. Many Virginians had
lived too fast for their fortunes, and naturally desired to
recuperate: many others, with a competency, longed for wealth;
and others again, with wealth, yearned—the common frailty—for
still more. Perhaps some friend or relative, who had come out,
wrote back flattering accounts of the El Dorado, and fired with
dissatisfaction those who were doing well enough at home, by
the report of his real or imagined success; for who that ever
moved
<pb n="92"/>
off, was not “doing well” in the new country, himself or friends
being chroniclers?</p>
            <p>Superior to many of the settlers in elegance of manners, and
general intelligence, it was the weakness of the Virginian to imagine
he was superior too in the essential art of being able to hold his
hand and make his way in a new country, and especially <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a
country, and at <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a time. What a mistake that was! The times
were out of joint. It was hard to say whether it were more
dangerous to stand still or to move. If the emigrant stood still, he
was consumed, by no slow degrees, by expenses: if he moved, ten
to one he went off in a galloping consumption, by a ruinous
investment. Expenses then—necessary articles about three times
as high, and extra articles still more extra-priced—were a different
thing in the new country from what they were in the old. In the old
country, a jolly Virginian, starting the business of free living on a
capital of a plantation, and fifty or sixty negroes, might reasonably
calculate, if no ill luck befell him, by the aid of a usurer, and the
occasional sale of a negro or two, to hold out without declared
insolvency, until a green old age. His estate melted like an estate in
chancery, under the gradual thaw of expenses; but in this fast
country, it went by the sheer cost of living—some <hi rend="italics">poker</hi> losses
included—like the fortune of the confectioner in California, who
failed for one hundred thousand dollars in the six months keeping
of a candy-shop. But all the habits of his life, his taste, his
associations, his education—every thing—the trustingness of his
disposition—his want
<pb n="93"/>
of business qualifications—his sanguine temper—all that was
Virginian in him, made him the prey, if not of imposture, at least
of unfortunate speculations. Where the keenest jockey often was
bit, what chance had <hi rend="italics">he</hi>?
About the same that the verdant Moses
had with the venerable old gentleman, his father's friend, at the
fair, when he traded the Vicar's pony for the green spectacles. But
how <hi rend="italics">could</hi> he believe it? how
could he believe that that
stuttering, grammarless Georgian, who had never heard of the
resolutions of '98, could beat him in a land trade?“ Have no
money dealings with my father,” said the friendly
Martha to Lord
Nigel, “for, idiot though he seems, he will make
an ass of thee.”
What a pity some monitor, equally wise and equally successful
with old Trapbois' daughter, had not been at the elbow of every
Virginian! “Twad frae monie a blunder free'd him—an' foolish
notion.”</p>
            <p>If he made a bad bargain, how could he expect to get rid of it?
<hi rend="italics">He</hi> knew nothing of the elaborate machinery of ingenious
chicane,—such as feigning bankruptcy—fraudulent
conveyances—making over to his wife—running property—and
had never heard of such tricks of trade as sending out coffins to
the graveyard, with negroes inside, carried off by sudden spells of
imaginary disease, to be “resurrected,” in due time, grinning, on
the banks of the Brazos.</p>
            <p>The new philosophy, too, had commended itself to his
speculative temper. He readily caught at the idea of a new
spirit of the age having set in, which rejected the saws of
Poor Richard as being as much out of date as his almanacs.
He
<pb n="94"/>
was already, by the great rise of property, compared to his
condition under the old-time prices, rich; and what were a few
thousands of debt, which two or three crops would pay off,
compared to the value of his estate? (He never thought that the
value of property might come down, while the debt was a fixed
fact.) He lived freely, for it was a liberal time, and liberal fashions
were in vogue, and it was not for a Virginian to be behind others in
hospitality and liberality. He required credit and security, and, of
course, had to stand security in return. When the crash came, and
no “accommodations”could be had, except
 in a few instances, and
in those on the most ruinous terms, he fell an easy victim. They
broke by neighborhoods. They usually endorsed for each other,
and when one fell—like the child's play of putting bricks on end at
equal distances, and dropping the first in the line against the
second, which fell against the third, and so on to the last—all
fell; each got broke as security, and yet few or none were able to pay
their own debts! So powerless of protection were they in those
times, that the witty H.G. used to say they reminded him of an
oyster, both shells torn off, lying on the beach, with the sea-gulls
screaming over them; the only question being, <hi rend="italics">which</hi> should
“gobble them up.”</p>
            <p>There was one consolation—if the Virginian involved himself
like a fool, he suffered himself to be sold out like a gentleman.
When his card house of visionary projects came tumbling about
his ears, the next question was, the one Webster plagiarized—
“Where am I to go?” Those who
<pb n="95"/>
had fathers, uncles, aunts, or other like dernier resorts, in Virginia,
limped back with feathers moulted and crestfallen, to the old
stamping ground, carrying the returned Californian's fortune of
ten thousand dollars—six bits in money, and the balance in
experience. Those who were in the condition of the prodigal, (barring
the father, the calf—the fatted one I mean—and the fiddle,) had
to turn their accomplishments to account; and many of them, having
lost all by eating and drinking, sought the retributive justice from
meat and drink, which might, at least, support them in poverty.
Accordingly, they kept tavern, and made a barter of hospitality, a
business, the only disagreeable part of which was receiving the
money, and the only one I know of for which a man can eat and
drink himself into qualification. And while I confess I never knew a
Virginian, out of the State, to keep a bad tavern, I never knew one to
draw a solvent breath from the time he opened house, until death or
the sheriff closed it.</p>
            <p>Others again got to be, not exactly overseers, but some
nameless thing, the duties of which were nearly analogous, for
some more fortunate Virginian, who had escaped the wreck, and
who had got his former boon companion to live with him on
board, or other wages, in some such relation that the friend was
not often found at table at the dinings given to the neighbors, and
had got to be called Mr. Flournoy instead of Bob, and slept in an
out-house in the yard, and only read the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> of nights and
Sundays.</p>
            <p>Some of the younger scions that had been transplanted early,
and stripped of their foliage at a tender age, had been
<pb n="96"/>
turned into birches for the corrective discipline of youth. Yes;
many, who had received academical or collegiate educations,
disregarding the allurements of the highway—turning from the
gala-day exercise of ditching—scorning the effeminate relaxation of
splitting rails—heroically led the Forlorn Hope of the battle of
life, the corps of pedagogues of country schools—<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">academies</foreign>
               </hi>, I beg
pardon for <hi rend="italics">not</hi> saying; for, under the Virginia economy, every
cross-road log cabin, where boys were flogged from B-a-k-e-r to
Constantinople, grew into the dignity of a sort of runt college; and
the teacher vainly endeavored to hide the meanness of the calling
beneath the sonorous <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</foreign>
               </hi> of Professor. “Were there no wars?”
Had <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the oysters been opened? Where was the regular army?
Could not interest procure service as a deck-hand on a steamboat?
Did no stage-driver, with a contract for running at night, through
the prairies in mid-winter, want help, at board wages, and sweet
lying in the loft, when off duty, thrown in? What right had the
Dutch Jews to monopolize <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the peddling? “To such vile uses
may we come at last, Horatio.” The subject grows melancholy. I
had a friend on whom this catastrophe descended. Tom
Edmundson was a buck of the first head—gay, witty, dashing,
vain, proud, handsome and volatile, and, withal, a dandy and lady's
man to the last intent in particular. He had graduated at the
University, and had just settled with his guardian, and received his
patrimony of ten thousand dollars in money. Being a young
gentleman of enterprise, he sought the alluring fields of
South-Western adventure,
<pb n="97"/>
and found them in this State. Before he well knew the condition
of his exchequer, he had made a permanent investment of one-half
of his fortune in cigars, Champagne, trinkets, buggies, horses, and
current expenses, including some small losses at poker, which
game he patronized merely for amusement; and found that it
diverted him a good deal, but diverted his cash much more. He
invested the balance, on private information kindly given him, in
“<hi rend="italics">Choctaw Floats</hi>;” a most lucrative investment it would have
turned out, but for the facts: 1. That the Indians never had any
title; 2. The white men who kindly interposed to act as guardians
for the Indians did not have the Indian title; and 3dly, the land, left
subject to entry, if the “Floats” had been good, was not worth
entering. “These imperfections off its head,”
 I know of no fancy
stock I would prefer to a “Choctaw Float.” 
“Brief, brave and
glorious” was “Tom's young career.” 
When Thomas found, as he
did shortly, that he had bought five thousand dollars' worth of
moonshine, and had no title to it, he honestly informed his
landlord of the state of his “fiscality,”
and that worthy kindly
consented to take a new buggy, at half price, in payment of the
old balance. The horse, a nick-tailed trotter, Tom had raffled off;
but omitting to require cash, the process of collection resulted in
his getting the price of one chance—the winner of the horse
magnanimously paying his subscription. The rest either had
gambling offsets, or else were not prepared just at any one
particular, given moment, to pay up, though always ready,
generally and in a general way.</p>
            <pb n="98"/>
            <p>Unlike his namesake, Tom and his landlady were not—for a
sufficient reason—very gracious; and so, the only common bond,
Tom's money, being gone, Tom received “notice to quit” in
regular form.</p>
            <p>In the hurry-burly of the times, I had lost sight of Tom for a
considerable period. One day, as I was travelling over the hills in
Greene, by a cross-road, leading me near a country mill, I stopped
to get water at a spring at the bottom of a hill. Clambering up the
hill, after remounting, on the other side, the summit of it brought
me to a view, through the bushes, of a log country school-house,
the door being wide open, and who did I see but Tom Edmundson,
dressed as fine as ever, sitting back in an arm-chair, one thumb in
his waistcoat armhole, the other hand brandishing a long switch, or
rather pole. As I approached a little nearer, I heard him speak out:
“Sir—Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia, was the author of the
Declaration of Independence—mind that. I thought everybody
knew that—even the Georgians.” Just then he saw me coming
through the bushes and entering the path that led by the door.
Suddenly he broke from the chair of state, and the door was
slammed to, and I heard some one of the boys, as I passed the
door, say—“Tell him he can't come in  -
the master's sick.” This
is the last I ever saw of Tom. I understand he afterwards moved to
Louisiana, where he married a rich French widow, having first,
however, to fight a duel with one of her sons, whose opposition
couldn't be appeased, until some such expiatory sacrifice to the
manes of his worthy father was
<figure>
                  <p>THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD. p. 98.</p>
               </figure>
               <pb n="99"/>
attempted; which failing, he made rather a
<hi rend="italics">lame</hi> apology for his
zealous indiscretion—the poor fellow could make no other—for
Tom had unfortunately fixed him for visiting his mother on
crutches the balance of his life.</p>
            <p>One thing I will say for the Virginians—I never knew one of
them, under any pressure, extemporize a profession. The
sentiment of reverence for the mysteries of medicine and law was
too large for a deliberate quackery; as to the pulpit, a man might
as well do his starving without the hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>But others were not so nice. I have known them to rush, when
the wolf was after them, from the counting-house or the
plantation, into a doctor's shop or a law office, as if those places
were the sanctuaries from the avenger; some pretending to be
doctors that did not know a liver from a gizzard, administering
medicine by the guess, without knowing enough of pharmacy to
tell whether the stuff exhibited in the big-bellied blue, red and green
bottles at the show-windows of the apothecaries' shops, was
given by the drop or the half-pint.</p>
            <p>Divers others left, but what became of them, I never knew
any more than they know what becomes of the sora after frost.</p>
            <p>Many were the instances of suffering; of pitiable misfortnue,
involving and crushing whole families; of pride abased; of
honorable sensibilities wounded; of the provision for old age
destroyed; of the hopes of manhood overcast of independence
dissipated, and the poor victim without
<pb n="100"/>
help, or hope, or sympathy, forced to petty shifts for a bare
subsistence, and a ground-scuffle, for what in happier days, he
threw away. But there were too many examples of this sort for
the expenditure of a useless compassion; just as the surgeon after
a battle, grows case-hardened, from an excess of objects of pity.</p>
            <p>My memory, however, fixes itself on one honored exception,
the noblest of the noble, the best of the good. Old Major Willis
Wormley had come in long before the
<hi rend="italics">new era</hi>. He belonged to the
old school of Virginians. Nothing could have torn him from the
Virginia he loved, as Jacopi Foscari, Venice, but
the marrying of his
eldest daughter, Mary, to a gentleman of Alabama. The Major was
something between, or made of about equal parts, of Uncle Toby
and Mr. Pickwick, with a slight flavor of Mr. Micawber. He was
the soul of kindness, disinterestedness and hospitality. Love to
every thing that had life in it, burned like a flame in his large and
benignant soul; it flowed over in his countenance, and glowed
through every feature, and moved every muscle in the frame it
animated. The Major lived freely, was rather corpulent, and had
not a lean thing on his plantations; the negroes; the dogs; the
horses; the cattle; the very chickens, wore an air of corpulent
complacency, and bustled about with a good-humored rotundity.
There was more laughing, singing and whistling at “Hollywood,”
then would have set up a dozen Irish fairs. The Major's wife had,
from a long life of affection, and the practice of the same pursuits,
and the indulgence of the same feelings and tastes, got so
<pb n="101"/>
much like him, that she seemed a feminine and modest edition of
himself. Four daughters were all that remained in the family—two
had been married off—and they had no son. The girls ranged from
sixteen to twenty-two, fine, hearty, whole-souled, wholesome,
cheerful lasses, with constitutions to last, and a flow of spirits like
mountain springs—not beauties, but good housewife girls, whose
open countenances, and neat figures, and rosy cheeks, and laughing
eyes, and frank and cordial manners, made them, at home, abroad,
on horseback or on foot, at the piano or discoursing on the old
English books, or Washington Irving's Sketch Book, a favorite in
the family ever since it was written, as entertaining and as well
calculated to fix solid impressions on the heart, as any four girls in
the country. The only difficulty was, they were so much alike,
that you were put to fault which to fall in love with. They were
all good housewives, or women, rather. But Mrs. Wormley, or
Aunt Wormley, as we called her, was as far ahead of any other
woman in that way, as could be found this side of the Virginia
border. If there was any thing good in the culinary line that she
couldn't make, I should like to know it. The Major lived on the
main stage road, and if any decently dressed man ever passed the
house after sundown, he escaped by sheer accident. The house
was greatly visited. The Major knew every body, and everybody
near him knew the Major. The stage coach couldn't stop long, but
in the hot summer days, about noon, as the driver tooted his horn
at the top of the red hill, two negro boys stood opposite the door,
with trays of the finest fruit, and a pitcher
<pb n="102"/>
of cider for the refreshment of the wayfarers. The Major himself
being on the look-out, with his hands over his eyes, bowing—as
he only could bow—vaguely into the coach, and looking wistfully,
to find among the passengers an acquaintance whom he could
prevail upon to get out and stay a week with him. There wasn't a
poor neighbor to whom the Major had not been as good as an
insurer, without premium, for his stock, or for his crop; and from
the way he rendered the service, you would think he was the
party obliged—as he was.</p>
            <p>This is not, in any country I have ever been in, a
moneymaking business; and the Major, though he always made
good crops, must have broke at it long ago, but for the fortunate
death of a few Aunts, after whom the girls were named, who,
paying their several debts of nature, left the Major the means to
pay his less serious, but still weighty obligations.</p>
            <p>The Major—for a wonder, being a Virginian—had no partisan
politics. He could not have. His heart could not hold any thing
that implied a warfare upon the thoughts or feelings of others. He
voted all the time for his friend, that is, the candidate living
nearest to him, regretting, generally, that he did not have another
vote for the other man.</p>
            <p>It would have done a Camanche Indian's heart good to see all
the family together—grand-children and all—of a winter evening,
with a guest or two, to excite sociability a little—not company
enough to embarrass the manifestations of affection. Such a
concordance—as if all hearts were attuned
<pb n="103"/>
to the same feeling—the old lady knitting in the
corner—the old man smoking his pipe opposite—both of their
fine faces radiating in the pauses of the laugh, the jest, or the
caress, the infinite satisfaction within.</p>
            <p>It was enough to convert an abolitionist, to see the old Major
when he came home from a long journey of two days to the
county town; the negroes running in a string to the buggy; this one
to hold the horse, that one to help the old man out, and the others
to inquire how he was; and to observe the benignity with
which—the kissing of the girls and the old lady hardly over—he
distributed a piece of calico here, a plug of tobacco there, or a card
of town ginger-bread to the little snow-balls that grinned around
him; what was given being but a small part of the gift, divested of
the kind, cheerful, rollicking way the old fellow had of giving it.</p>
            <p>The Major had given out his autograph (as had almost every
body else) as endorser on three several bills of exchange, of even
tenor and date, and all maturing at or about the same time. His
friend's friend failed to pay as he or his firm agreed, the friend
himself did no better, and the Major, before he knew any thing at
all of his danger, found a writ served upon him, and was told by
his friend that he was dead broke, and all he could give him was
his sympathy; the which, the Major as gratefully received as if it
was a legal tender and would pay the debt. The Major's friends
advised him he could get clear of it; that notice of protest not
having been sent to the Major's post-office,
<pb n="104"/>
released him; but the Major wouldn't hear of such a defence; he
said <hi rend="italics">his</hi> understanding was, that he was to pay the debt if his
friend didn't; and to slip out of it by a quibble, was little better
than pleading the gambling act. Besides, what would the lawyers
say? And what would be said by his old friends in Virginia, when
it reached their ears, that he had plead want of notice, to get clear
of a debt, when every body knew it was the same thing as if he
had got notice. And if this defence were good at law, it would not
be in equity; and if they took it into chancery, it mattered not
what became of the ease, the property would all go, and he never
could expect to see the last of it. No, no; he would pay it, and had
as well set about it at once.</p>
            <p>The rumor of the Major's condition spread far and wide. It
reached old N.D., “an angel,” whom the Major had
“entertained,” and one of the few that ever travelled that road. He
came, post haste, to see into the affair; saw the creditor; made
him, upon threat of defence, agree to take half the amount, and
discharge the Major; advanced the money, and took the Major's
negroes—except the house-servants—and put them on his
Mississippi plantation to work out the debt.</p>
            <p>The Major's heart pained him at the thought of the negroes
going off; he couldn't witness it; though he consoled himself with
the idea of the discipline and exercise being good for the health of
sundry of them who had contracted sedentary diseases.</p>
            <p>The Major turned his house into a tavern—that is,
<pb n="105"/>
changed its name—put up a sign, and three weeks afterwards,
you couldn't have told that any thing had happened. The family
were as happy as ever—the Major never having put on airs of
arrogance in prosperity, felt no humiliation in adversity; the girls
were as cheerful, as bustling, and as light-hearted as ever, and
seemed to think of the duties of hostesses as mere bagatelles, to
enliven the time. The old Major was as profluent of anecdotes as
ever, and never grew tired of telling the same ones to every new
guest; and yet, the Major's anecdotes were all of Virginia growth,
and not one of them under the legal age of twenty-one. If the
Major had worked his negroes as he had those anecdotes, he
would have been able to pay off the bills of exchange without any
difficulty.</p>
            <p>The old lady and the girls laughed at the anecdotes, though
they must have heard them at least a thousand times, and knew
them by heart; for the Major told them without the variations;
and the other friends of the Major laughed too; indeed, with such
an air of thorough benevolence, and in such a truly social spirit
did the old fellow proceed “the tale to unfold,” that a Cassius like
rascal that wouldn't laugh, whether he saw any thing to laugh at or
not, ought to have been sent to the Penitentiary for life—half of
the time to be spent in solitary confinement<corr>.</corr>

            <head>ASSAULT AND BATTERY.</head>
            <p>A trial came off not precisely in our bailiwick, but in the
neighborhood, of great comic interest. It was really a case of a good
deal of aggravation, and the defendants, fearing the result,
employed four of the ablest lawyers practicing at the M. bar, to
defend them. The offence charged was only assault and battery; but
the evidence showed a conspiracy to inflict great violence on the
person of the prosecutor, who had done nothing to provoke it, and
that the attempt to effect it was followed by severe injury to him.
The prosecutor was an original. He had been an old-field
schoolmaster, and was as conceited and pedantic a fellow as could
be found in a summer's day, even in that profession. It was thought
the policy of the defence to make as light of the case as possible,
and to cast as much ridicule on the affair as they could. J.E. and W.M.
led the defence, and, although the talents of the former were
rather adapted to grave discussion than pleasantry, he agreed to
doff his heavy armor for the lighter weapons of wit and ridicule.
M. was in his element. He was at all times and on all occasions at
home when fun was to be
<pb n="107"/>
raised: the difficulty with him was rather to restrain than to create
mirth and laughter. The case was called and put to the jury. The
witness, one Burwell Shines, was called for the prosecution. A
broad grin was upon the faces of the counsel for the defence as he
came forward. It was increased when the clerk said, “<hi rend="italics">Burrell</hi>
Shines come to the book;” and the witness, with deliberate
emphasis, remarked—“My christian name is not <hi rend="italics">Burrell</hi>, but
<hi rend="italics">Burwell</hi>—though I am vulgarly denominated by the former
epithet.” “Well,” said double word the clerk, “Bur-<hi rend="italics">well</hi> Shines come to
the book and be sworn.” He was sworn and directed to take the
stand. He <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a picture!</p>
            <p>He was dressed with care. His toilet was elaborate and
befitting the magnitude and dignity of the occasion, the part he
was to fill and the high presence into which he had come. He was
evidently favorably impressed with his own personal
pulchritude; yet, with an air of modest deprecation, as if he said
by his manner, “after all, what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> beauty that man should be
proud of it, and what are fine clothes, that the wearers should put
themselves above the unfortunate mortals who have them not?”</p>
            <p>He advanced with deliberate gravity to the stand. There he
stood, his large bell-crowned hat with nankeen-colored nap an
inch long in his hand; which hat he carefully handed over the bar
to the clerk, to hold until he should get through his testimony. He
wore a blue single-breasted coat with new brass buttons; a vest of
bluish calico; nankeen pants that struggled to make both ends
meet, but failed, by
<pb n="108"/>
a few inches, in the legs, yet made up for it by fitting a little better
than the skin every where else; his head stood upon a shirt collar
that held it up by the ears, and a cravat something smaller than a
table-cloth, bandaged his throat: his face was narrow, long and grave,
with an indescribable air of ponderous wisdom, which, as Fox said
of Thurlow, “proved him <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> a hypocrite; as it was <hi rend="italics">impossible</hi> for
<hi rend="italics">any</hi> man to be as wise as <hi rend="italics">he</hi> looked.” Gravity and decorum marked
every lineament of his countenance, and every line of his body. All
the wit of Hudibras could not have moved a muscle of his face. His
conscience would have smitten him for a laugh almost as soon as for
an oath. His hair was roached up, and stood as erect and upright as
his body; and his voice was slow, deep, in “linked sweetness long
drawn out,” and modulated according to the camp-meeting standard
of elocution. Three such men at a country frolic, would have turned
an old Virginia Reel into a Dead March. He was one of Carlyle's
earnest men. Cromwell would have made him Ensign of the
Ironsides, and ex-officio chaplain at first sight. He took out his
pocket hankerchief, slowly unfolded it from the shape in which it
came from the washerwoman's, and awaited the interrogation. As he
waited, he spat on the floor and nicely wiped it out with his foot.
The solicitor told him to tell about the difficulty in hand. He gazed
around on the court—then on the bar—then on the jury—then on
the crowd—addressing each respectively as he turned: “May it
please your honor—Gentlemen of the bar—Gentlemen of the
jury—Audience. Before proceeding to give my
<pb n="109"/>
testimonial observations, I must premise that I am a member of the
Methodist Episcopal, otherwise called Wesleyan persuasion of
Christian individuals. One bright Sabbath morning in May, the 15th
day of the month, the past year, while the birds were singing their
matutinal songs from the trees, I sallied forth from the dormitory
of my Seminary, to enjoy the reflections so well suited to that
auspicious occasion. I had not proceeded far, before my ears were
accosted with certain Bacchanalian sounds of revelry, which
proceeded from one of those haunts of vicious depravity, located
at the Cross Roads, near the place of my boyhood, and
fashionably denominated a doggery. No sooner had I passed
beyond the precincts of this diabolical rendezvous of rioting
debauchees, than I heard behind me the sounds of approaching
footsteps as if in pursuit. Having heard previously, sundry
menaces, which had been made by these proposterous and
incarnadine individuals of hell, now on trial in prospect of condign
punishment, fulminated against the longer continuance of my
corporeal salubrity, for no better reason than that I reprobated
their criminal orgies, and not wishing my reflections to be
disturbed, I hurried my steps with a gradual accelerated motion.
Hearing, however, their continued advance, and the repeated
shoutings, articulating the murderous accents, “Kill him! Kill
Shadbelly with his praying clothes on!”(which was a profane
designation of myself and my religious profession;) and casting
my head over my left shoulder in a manner somehow reluctantly
thus, (throwing his head to one side ) and perceiving their near
approximation,
<pb n="110"/>
I augmented my speed into what might be denominated a
gentle slope—and subsequently augmented the same into a species
of dog-trot. But all would not do. Gentlemen, the destroyer came.
As I reached the fence and was about propelling my body over the
same, felicitating myself on my prospect of escape from my
remorseless pursuers, they arrived, and James William Jones,
called, by nickname, Buck Jones, that red-headed character now
at the bar of this honorable court, seized a fence rail, grasped it in
both hands, and standing on tip-toe, hurled the same, with mighty
emphasis, against my cerebellum: which blow felled me to the
earth. Straightway, like ignoble curs upon a disabled lion, these
bandit ruffians and incarnadine assassins leaped upon me, some
pelting, some bruising, some gouging—“every thing by turns, and
nothing long,” as the poet hath it; and one of them, which one
unknown to me—having no eyes behind—inflicted with his
teeth, a grievous wound upon my person—where, I need not
specify. At length, when thus prostrate on the ground, one of
those bright ideas, common to minds of men of genius, struck me: I
forthwith sprang to my feet—drew forth my cutto—circulated
the same with much vivacity among their several and respective
corporeal systems, and every time I circulated the same I felt
their iron grasp relax. As cowardly recreants, even to their own
guilty friendships, two of these miscreants, though but slightly
perforated by my cutto, fled, leaving the other two, whom I had
disabled by the vigor and energy of my incisions, prostrate and in
my power: these lustily called for quarter,
<pb n="111"/>
shouting out “enough!” or, in their barbarous dialect, being as
corrupt in language as in morals, “nuff;” which quarter I
magnanimously extended them, as unworthy of my farther
vengeance, and fit only as subject of penal infliction, at the hands
of the offended laws of their country; to which laws I do now
consign them: hoping such mercy for them as their crimes will
permit; which, in my judgment, (having read the code,) is not
much. This is my statement on oath, fully and truly, nothing
extenuating and naught setting down in malice; and, if I have
omitted any thing, in form or substance, I stand ready to supply
the omission; and if I have stated any thing amiss, I will
cheerfully correct the same, limiting the averment, with
appropriate modifications, provisions and restrictions. The
learned counsel may now proceed more particularly to interrogate
me of and respecting the premises.”</p>
            <p>After this oration, Burwell wiped the perspiration from his
brow, and the counsel for the State took him. Few questions were
asked him, however, by that official; he confining himself to a
recapitulation in simple terms, of what the witness had declared,
and procuring Burwell's assent to his translation. Long and
searching was the cross-examination by the defendants' counsel;
but it elicited nothing favorable to the defence, and nothing
shaking, but much to confirm Burwell's statement.</p>
            <p>After some other evidence, the examination closed, and the
argument to the jury commenced. The solicitor very briefly
adverted to the leading facts, deprecated any attempt
<pb n="112"/>
to turn the case into ridicule—admitted that the witness was a
man of eccentricity and pedantry, but harmless and inoffensive—
a man evidently of conscientiousness and respectability; that he
had shown himself to be a peaceable man, but when occasion
demanded, a brave man; that there was a conspiracy to assassinate
him upon no cause except an independence, which was honorable
to him, and an attempt to execute the purpose, in pursuance of
previous threats and severe injury by several confederates on a
single person, and this on the Sabbath, and when he was seeking
to avoid them.</p>
            <p>W.M. rose to reply. All Screamersville turned out to hear him.
William was a great favorite—the most popular speaker in the
country—had the versatility of a mockingbird, an aptitude for
burlesque that would have given him celebrity as a dramatist, and a
power of acting that would have made his fortune on the boards of
a theatre. A rich treat was expected, but it didn't come. The
witness had taken all the wind out of William's sails. He had
rendered burlesque impossible. The thing as acted was more
ludicrous than it could be as described. The crowd had laughed
themselves hoarse already; and even M.'s comic powers seemed
and were felt by himself to be humble imitations of a greater
master. For once in his life, M. dragged his subject heavily
along—the matter began to grow serious—fun failed to come
when M. called it up. M. closed between a lame argument, a timid
deprecation, and some only tolerable humor. He was followed by
E., in a discursive, argumentative,
<pb n="113"/>
sarcastic, drag-net sort of speech, which did all that could
be done for the defence. The solicitor briefly closed—seriously
and confidently confining himself to a repetition of the matters
first insisted, and answering some of the points of the counsel.</p>
            <p>It was an ominous fact that a juror, before the jury retired
under leave of the court, recalled a witness for the purpose of
putting a question to him—the question was, how much the
defendants were worth; the answer was, about two thousand
dollars.</p>
            <p>The jury shortly after returned into court with a verdict
which “sized their pile.”</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">My Dear Sir,</hi>
 —Having established, at great expense, and from
motives purely patriotic and disinterested, a monthly periodical
for the purpose of supplying a desideratum in American
Literature, namely, the commemoration and perpetuation of the
names, characters, and personal and professional traits and
histories of American lawyers and jurists, I have taken the liberty
of soliciting <hi rend="italics">your</hi> consent to be made the subject of one of the
memoirs, which shall adorn the columns of this Journal. This
suggestion is made from my knowledge, shared by the intelligence
of the whole country, of your distinguished standing and merits in
our noble profession; and it is seconded by the wishes and
requests of many of the most prominent gentlemen in public and
private life, who have the honor of your acquaintance.</p>
               <pb n="115"/>
               <p>The advantages of a work of this sort, in its more public and
general bearing, are so <hi rend="italics">patent</hi>, that it would be useless for me to
refer to them. The effect of the publication upon the fame of the
individual commemorated is, if not equally apparent, at least,
equally decided. The fame of an American lawyer, like that of an
actor, though sufficiently marked and cognizable within the region
of his practice, and by the witnesses of his performances, is
nevertheless, for the want of an organ for its national
dissemination, or of an enduring memorial for its preservation, apt
to be ephemeral, or, at most, to survive among succeeding
generations, only in the form of unauthentic and vague traditions.
What do we know of Henry or of Grundy as lawyers, except that
they were eloquent and successful advocates. But what they did
was to acquire reputation, and, of course, the true value of it, is
left to conjecture; or, as in the case of the former, especially, to
posthumous invention or embellishment.</p>
               <p>It was the observation of the great Pinkney, that the lawyer's
distinction was preferable to all others, since it was impossible to
acquire in our profession, a false or fraudulent reputation. How
true this aphorism is, the pages of this L.w M.....e will abundantly
illustrate.</p>
               <p>The value, and, indeed, the fact of distinction, consists in its
uncommonness. In a whole nation of giants, the Welsh monster in
Barnum's Museum would be undistinguished. Therefore,
<hi rend="italics">we</hi>—excuse the editorial plural  -
strive to collect the histories only
of the most eminent of the profession in the several States; the
aggregate of whom reaches
<pb n="116"/>
some two or three hundred names. You have undoubtedly seen
some of the numbers of our work, which will better illustrate our
plan, and the mode of its past, as well as the intended mode of its
future, execution.</p>
               <p>It would be affectation, my dear sir, to deny that what mainly
consoles us under a sense of the hazardous nature of such an
enterprise to our <hi rend="italics">personal</hi> fortunes  -
pardon the pun, if you
please—and amidst the anxieties of so laborious an undertaking, is
the expectation, that, through our labors, the reputation of
distinguished men of the country, constituting its moral treasure,
may be preserved for the admiration and direction of mankind, not
for a day, but for all time. And it has occurred to me, that such
true merit as yours might find a motive for your
enrollment among
the known sages and profound intellects of the land, not less in
the natural desire of a just perpetuation of renown, than in the
patriotism which desires the improvement of the race of lawyers
who are to come after you, and the adding to the accredited
standards of public taste and professional attainment and genius.</p>
               <p>We know from experience, that the characteristic diffidence of
the profession, in many instances, shrinks from the seeming,
though falsely seeming, indelicacy of an egotistical
parade of one's
own talents and accomplishments, and from walking into a niche
of the Pantheon of American genius we have opened, and over the
entrance to which, “FOR THE GREAT” is inscribed. But the
facility with which this difficulty has been surmounted by some,
of whose success we had reason to entertain apprehensions, adds
but further evidence
<pb n="117"/>
of the capacity which the noble profession of the law gives for
the most arduous exploits. Besides, sir, although the facts are
expected to be furnished by the subject, yet the first person is
but seldom used in the memoir—some complaisant friend, or
some friend's name being employed as editor of the work; the
subject sometimes, indeed, having nothing to do except to revise
it and transmit it to this office.</p>
               <p>You may remember, my dear Colonel, the exclamatory line of
the poet—</p>
               <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                  <l part="N">—“How hard it is to climb</l>
                  <l part="N">The steep where fame's proud temple shines afar.”</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And so it used to be: but in this wonderfully progressive age it
is no longer so. It is the pride of your humble correspondent to
have constructed a plan, by means of his journal, whereby a
gentleman of genius may, with the assistance of a single friend, or
even without it, wind himself, up from the vale below, as by a
windlass, up to the very cupola of the temple.</p>
               <p>May we rely upon your sending us the necessary papers,
viz., a sketch of your life, genius, exploits, successes,
accomplishments, virtues, family antecedents, personal
pulchritudes, professional habitudes, and whatever else you may
deem interesting. You can see from former numbers of our work,
that nothing will be irrelevant or out of place. The sketch may be

               <head>SIMON SUGGS, JR., ESQ.
                       <lb/> OF
              RACKINSACK—ARKANSAW.</head>
               <p>This distinguished lawyer, unlike the majority of those
favored subjects of the biographical muse, whom a patriotic
ambition to add to the moral treasures of the country, has
prevailed on, over the instincts of a native and professional
modesty, to supply subjects for the pens and pencils of their
friends, was not quite, either in a literal or metaphorical sense, a
self-made man. He had ancestors. They were, moreover, men of
distinction; and, on the father's side, in the first and second
degrees of ascent known to fame. The
<pb n="122"/>
father of this distinguished barrister was, and, happily, is Capt.
Simon Suggs, of the Tallapoosa volunteers, and celebrated not
less for his financial skill and abilities, than for his martial exploits.
His grandfather, the Rev. Jedediah Suggs, was a noted divine of
the Anti-Missionary or Hardshell Baptist persuasion in Georgia.
For further information respecting these celebrities, the ignorant
reader—the well-informed already know them—is referred to the
work of Johnson Hooper, Esq., one of the most authentic of
modern biographers.</p>
               <p>The question of the propagability of moral and intellectual
qualities is a somewhat mooted point, into the metaphysics of
which we do not propose to enter; but that there are instances of
moral and intellectual as well as physical likenesses in families, is
an undisputed fact, of which the subject of this memoir is a new
and striking illustration.</p>
               <p>In the month of July, Anno Domini, 1810, on the ever
memorable fourth day of the month, in the county of Carroll, and
State of Georgia, Simon Suggs, Jr., first saw the light, mingling the
first noise he made in the world with the patriotic explosions and
rejoicings going on in honor of the day. We have endeavored in
vain to ascertain, whether the auspicious period of the birth of
young Simon was a matter of accident, or of human calculation,
and sharp foresight, for which his immediate ancestor on the
paternal side was so eminently distinguished; but, beyond a
knowing wink, and a characteristic laudation of his ability to
accomplish wonderful things, and to keep the run of the cards, on
the part
<pb n="123"/>
of the veteran captain, we have obtained no reliable information
on this interesting subject. It is something, however, to be
remarked upon, that the natal day of his country and of Simon
were the same.</p>
               <p>Very early in life, our hero—for Peace hath her victories, and,
of course, her heroes, as well as war—gave a promise of the
hereditary genius of the Suggs's; but as the incidents in proof of
this rest on the authority, merely, of family tradition, we shall not
violate the sanctity of the domestic fireside, by relating them. In
the ninth year of his age he was sent to the public school in the
neighborhood. Here he displayed that rare vivacity and enterprise,
and that shrewdness and invention, which subsequently
distinguished his riper age. Like his father, his study was less of
books than of men. Indeed, it required a considerable expenditure
of birch, and much wear and tear of patience, to overcome his
constitutional aversion to letters sufficiently to enable him to
master the alphabet. Not that he was too lazy to learn; on the
contrary, it was his extreme industry in other and more congenial
pursuits that stood in the way of the sedentary business of
instruction. It was not difficult to see that the mantle of the
Captain had fallen upon his favorite son; at any rate, the breeches
in which young Simon's lower proportions were encased, bore a
wonderful resemblance to the old cloak that the Captain had
sported on so many occasions.</p>
               <p>Simon's course at school was marked by many of the traits
which distinguished him in after life; so true is the aphorism
<pb n="124"/>
which the great Englishman enounced, that the boy is father to the
man. His genius was eminently commercial, and he was by no
means deficient in practical arithmetic. This peculiar turn of mind
displayed itself in his barterings for the small wares of schoolboy
merchandise—tops, apples, and marbles, sometimes rising to the
dignity of a pen-knife. In these exercises of infantile enterprise, it
was observable that Simon always got the advantage in the trade;
and in that sense of charity which conceals defects, he may be said
to have always displayed that virtue to a considerable degree. The
same love of enterprise early led him into games of hazard, such as
push-pin, marbles, chuck-a-luck, heads and tails, and other like
boyish pastimes, in which his ingenuity was rewarded by marked
success. The vivacious and eager spirit of this gifted urchin
sometimes evolved and put in practice, even in the presence of the
master, expedients of such sort as served to enliven the proverbial
monotony of scholastic confinement and study: such, for example,
were the traps set for the unwary and heedless scholar, made by
thrusting a string through the eye of a needle and passing it
through holes in the school bench—one end of the string being
attached to the machinist's leg, and so fixed, that by pulling the
string, the needle would protrude through the further hole and
into the person of the urchin sitting over it, to the great
divertisement of the spectators of this innocent pastime. The
holes being filled with soft putty, the needle was easily replaced,
and the point concealed, so that when the outcry of the victim
was heard, Simon was diligently
<pb n="125"/>
perusing his book, and the only consequence was a dismissal of
the complaint, and the amercement of the complainant by the
master, <hi rend="italics">
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">pro falso clamore</foreign>
                  </hi>. Beginning to be a little more boldly
enterprising, the usual fortune of those who “conquer or excel
mankind” befell our hero, and he was made the scape-goat
of the school; all vagrant offences that could not be proved
against any one else being visited upon him; a summary
procedure, which, as Simon remarked, brought down genius to the
level of blundering mediocrity, and made of no avail the most
ingenious arts of deception and concealment. The master of the
old field school was one of the regular faculty, who had great faith
in the old medicine for the eradication of moral diseases—the
cutaneous tonic, as he called it—and repelled, with great scorn,
the modern quackeries of kind encouragement and moral suasion.
Accordingly, the flagellations and cuffings which Simon received,
were such and so many as to give him a high opinion of the
powers of endurance, the recuperative energies, and the immense
vitality of the human system. Simon tried, on one occasion, the
experiment of fits; but Dominie Dobbs was inexorable; and as the
fainting posture only exposed to the Dominie new and fresher
points of attack, Simon was fain to unroll his eyes, draw up again
his lower jaw, and come too. Simon, remarking in his moralizing
way upon the virtue of perseverance, has been heard to declare
that he “lost that game” by being unable to keep from scratching
during a space of three minutes and a half; which he would have
accomplished, but for the Dominie's
<pb n="126"/>
touching him on the raw, caused by riding a race bare-backed the
Sunday before. “Upon what slender threads hang the greatest
events!” Doubtless these experiences of young Suggs were not
without effect upon so observing and sagacious an intellect. To
them we may trace that strong republican bias and those fervid
expressions in favor of Democratic principles, which, all through
life, and in the ranks of whatever party he might be found, he ever
exhibited and made; and probably to the unfeeling, and sometimes
unjust inflictions of Dominie Dobbs, was he indebted for his
devotion to that principle of criminal justice he so pertinaciously
upheld, which requires full proof of guilt before it awards
punishment.</p>
               <p>We must pass over a few years in the life of Simon, who
continued at school, growing in size and wisdom; and not more
instructed by what he learned there, than by the valuable
information which his reverend father gave him in the shape of his
sage counsels and sharp experiences of the world and its ways
and wiles. An event occurred in Simon's fifteenth year, which
dissolved the tie that bound him to his rustic <hi rend="italics">Alma Mater</hi>, the
only institution of letters which can boast of his connection with
it. Dominie Dobbs, one Friday evening, shortly after the close of
the labors of the scholastic week, was quietly taking from a
handkerchief in which he had placed it, a flask of powder; as he
pressed the knot of the handkerchief, it pressed upon the slide of
the flask, which as it revolved, bore upon a lucifer match that
ignited the powder; the explosion tore the handkerchief
<pb n="127"/>
to pieces, and also one ear and three fingers of the Dominie's
right hand—those fingers that had wielded the birch upon young
Simon with such effect. Suspicion fell on Simon, notwithstanding
he was the first boy to leave the school that evening. This
suspicion derived some corroboration from other facts; but the
evidence was wholly circumstantial. No positive proof whatever
connected Simon with this remarkable accident; but the
characteristic prudence of the elder Suggs suggested the
expediency of Simon's leaving for a time a part of the country
where character was held in so little esteem. Accordingly the
influence of his father procured for Simon a situation in the
neighboring county of Randolph, in the State of Alabama, near the
gold mines, as clerk or assistant in a store for retailing spirituous
liquors, which the owner, one Dixon Tripes, had set up for
refreshment of the public, without troubling the County Court for
a license. Here Simon was early initiated into a knowledge of men,
in such situations as to present their characters nearly naked to
the eye. The neighbors were in the habit of assembling at the
grocery, almost every day, in considerable numbers, urged thereto
by the attractions of the society, and the beverage there
abounding; and games of various sorts added to the charms of
conversation and social intercourse. It was the general rendezvous
of the fast young gentlemen for ten miles around; and horse-racing,
shooting-matches, quoit-pitching, cock-fighting, and card-playing
filled up the vacant hours between drinks.</p>
               <pb n="128"/>
               <p>In such choice society it may well be supposed that so
sprightly a temper and so inquisitive a mind as Simon's found congenial
and delightful employment; and it was not long before his
acquirements ranked him among the foremost in that select and
spirited community. Although good at all the games mentioned,
card-playing constituted his favorite amusement, not less for the
excitement it afforded him, than for the rare opportunity it gave
him of studying the human character.</p>
               <p>The skill he attained in measuring distances, was equal to that
displayed in his youth, by his venerated father, insomuch that in
any disputed question in pitching or shooting, to allow him to
measure was to give him the match; while his proficiency “in
arranging the papers”—vulgarly called
stocking a pack—was
nearly equal to sleight of hand. Having been appointed judge of a
quarter race on one occasion, he decided in favor of one of the
parties by three inches and a half; and such was the sense of the
winner of Simon's judicial expertness and impartiality, that
immediately after the decision was made, he took Simon behind
the grocery and divided the purse with him. By means of the
accumulation of his wonderful industry, Simon went forth with a
somewhat heterogeneous assortment of plunder, to set up a traffic
on his own account: naturally desiring a wider theatre, which he
found in the city of Columbus in his native State. He returned to
the paternal roof with an increased store of goods and experience
from his sojourn in Alabama. Among other property, he brought
with him a

                  </figure>
                  <pb n="129"/>
small race mare, which excited the acquisitiveness of his father,
who, desiring an easier mode of acquisition than by purchase,
proposed to stake a horse he had (the same he had swapped for,
on the road to Montgomery, with the land speculator,) against
Simon's mare, upon the issue of a game of
<hi rend="italics">seven up</hi>. Since the game of
chess between Mr. Jefferson and the French Minister, which
lasted three years, perhaps there never has been a more closely
contested match than that between these keen, sagacious and
practiced sportsmen. It was played with all advantages; all the
lights of science were shed upon that game. The old gentleman had
the advantage of experience—the young of genius: it was the old
fogy against young America. For a long time the result was
dubious; as if Dame Fortune was unable or unwilling to decide
between her favorites. The game stood <hi rend="italics">six
and six</hi>, and young
Simon had the deal. Just as the deal commenced, after one of the
most brilliant shuffles the senior had ever made, Simon carelessly
laid down his tortoise-shell snuff-box on the table; and the father,
affecting <hi rend="italics">nonchalance</hi>, and
inclining his head towards the box, in
order to peep under as the cards were being dealt, took a pinch of
snuff; the titillating restorative was strongly adulterated with
cayenne pepper; the old fogy was compelled to sneeze; and just as
he recovered from the concussion, the first object that met his eye
was a Jack turning in Simon's hand. A struggle seemed to be going
on in the old man's breast between a feeling of pride in his son and
a sense of his individual loss. It soon ceased, however. The father
<pb n="130"/>
congratulated his son upon his success, and swore that he was
wasting his genius in a retail business of “shykeenry” when
nature had designed him for the bar.</p>
               <p>To follow Simon through the eventful and checkered scenes of
his nascent manhood, would be to enlarge this sketch to a volume.
We must be content to state briefly, that such was the proficiency
he made in the polite accomplishments of the day, and such the
reputation he acquired in all those arts which win success in legal
practice, when thereto energetically applied, that many sagacious
men predicted that <hi rend="italics">the law would yet elevate Simon to a prominent
place in the public view</hi>. In his twenty-first year, Simon, starting
out with a single mare to trade in horses in the adjoining State of
Alabama, returned, such was his success, with a drove of six
horses and a mule, and among them the very mare he started
with. These, with the exception of the mare, he converted into
money; he had found her invincible in all trials of speed, and
determined to keep her. Trying his fortune once more in Alabama,
where he had been so eminently successful, Simon went to the
city of Wetumpka, where he found the races about coming off. As
his mare had too much reputation to get bets upon her, an
ingenious idea struck Simon—it was to take bets, through an
agent, <hi rend="italics">against</hi> her, in favor
of a long-legged horse, entered for the
races. It was very plain to see that Simon's mare was bound to
win if he let her. He backed his own mare openly, and got some
trifling bets on her; and his agent was fortunate enough to pick up
a green-looking
<pb n="131"/>
Georgia sucker, who bet with him the full amount left of Simon's
“pile.” The stakes were deposited in
due form to the amount of
some two thousand dollars. Simon was to ride his own
mare—wild Kate, as he called her—and he
had determined to hold
her back, so that the other horse should win. But the Georgian,
having by accident overheard the conversation between Simon
and his agent, before the race, cut the reins of Simon's bridle
nearly through, but in so ingenious a manner,
that the incision did
not appear. The race came off as it had been arranged; and as
Simon was carefully holding back his emulous filly, at the same
time giving her whip and spur, as though he would have her do
her best, the bridle broke under the strain; and the mare, released
from check, flew to and past the goal like the wind, some three
hundred yards ahead of the horse, upon the success of which
Simon had “piled” up so largely.</p>
               <p>A shout of laughter like that which pursued Mazeppa, arose
from the crowd (to whom the Georgian had communicated the
facts), as Simon swept by, the involuntary winner of the race; and
in that laugh, Simon heard the announcement of the discovery of
his ingenious contrivance. He did not return.</p>
               <p>Old Simon, when he heard of this counter-mine, fell into
paroxysms of grief, which could not find consolation in less than
a quart of red-eye. Heart-stricken, the old patriarch exclaimed—
“Oh! Simon! my son Simon! to be overcome in that way!—a
Suggs to be humbugged! His own Jack to be taken outen his
hand and turned on him! Oh! that I should ha' lived
to see this day!”</p>
               <pb n="132"/>
               <p>Proceeding to Montgomery, Simon found an opening on the
thither side of a faro table; and having disposed of the race mare
for three hundred dollars, banked on this capital, but with small
success. Mr. Suggs' opinion of the people of Montgomery was
not high; they were fashioned on a very diminutive scale, he used
to say, and degraded the national amusement, by wagers, which an
enterprising boy would scorn to hazard at push-pin. One Sam
Boggs, a young lawyer “of that ilk,” having been cleaned out of
his entire stake of ten dollars, wished to continue the game on
credit, and Simon gratified him, taking his law license in pawn for
two dollars and a half; which pawn the aforesaid Samuel failed to
redeem. Our prudent and careful adventurer filed away the
sheepskin, thinking that sometime or other, he might be able to
put it to good use.</p>
               <p>The losses Simon had met with, and the unpromising
prospects of gentlemen who lived on their wits, now that the hard
times had set in, produced an awakening influence upon his
conscience. He determined to abandon the nomadic life he had led,
and to settle himself down to some regular business. He had long
felt a call to the law, and he now resolved to
“locate,” and apply
himself to the duties of that learned profession. Simon was not
long in deciding upon a location. The spirited manner in which the
State of Arkansas had repudiated a public debt of some five
hundred thousand dollars gave him a favorable opinion of that
people as a community of litigants, while the accounts which
came teeming from that bright land, of murders and felonies
<pb n="133"/>
innumberable, suggested the value of the criminal practice. He
wended his way into that State, nor did he tarry until he reached
the neighborhood of Fort Smith, a promising border town in the
very <hi rend="italics">Ultima Thule of civilization</hi>,
such as it was, just on the confines
of the Choctaw nation. It was in this region, in the village of
Rackensack, that he put up his sign, and offered himself for
practice. I shall not attempt to describe the population. It is
indescribable. I shall only say that the Indians and half-breeds
across the border complained of it mightily.</p>
               <p>The motive for Simon's seeking so remote a location was that he
might get in advance of his reputation—being laudably ambitious
to acquire forensic distinction, he wished his fame as a lawyer to
be independent of all extraneous and adventitious assistance. His
first act in the practice was under the statute of
 <hi rend="italics">Jeo Fails</hi>. It
consisted of an amendment of the license he had got from Boggs,
as before related; which amendment, was ingeniously effected by a
careful erasure of the name of that gentleman, and the insertion of
his own in the place of it. Having accomplished this feat, he
presented it to the court, then in session, and was duly admitted
an attorney and counsellor at law and solicitor in chancery.</p>
               <p>There is a tone and spirit of morality attaching to the
profession of the law so elevating and pervasive in its influence,
as to work an almost instantaneous reformation in the character
and habits of its disciples. If this be not so, it was certainly a most
singular coincidence that, just at the
<pb n="134"/>
time of his adoption of this vocation, Simon abandoned the
favorite pastimes of his youth, and the irregularities of his earlier
years. Indeed, he has been heard to declare that any lawyer,
fulfilling conscientiously the duties of his profession, will find
enough to employ all his resources of art, stratagem and dexterity,
without resorting to other and more equivocal methods for their
exercise.</p>
               <p>It was not long before Simon's genius began to find occasions
and opportunities of exhibition. When he first came to the
bar, there were but seven suits on the docket, two of those being
appeals from a justice's court. In the course of six months, so
indefatigable was he in instructing clients, as to their rights, the
number of suits grew to forty. Simon—or as he is now
called—<hi rend="italics">Colonel</hi> Suggs,
determined on winning reputation in a
most effective branch of practice—one that he shrewdly
perceived was too much neglected by the profession—the branch
of preparing cases <hi rend="italics">out of court</hi>
for trial. While other lawyers were
busy in getting up the law of their cases, the Colonel was no less
busy in getting up the facts of his.</p>
               <p>One of the most successful of Col. Suggs' efforts, was in
behalf of his landlady, in whom he felt a warm and decided
interest. She had been living for many years in ignorant
contentedness, with an indolent, easy natured man, her husband,
who was not managing her separate estate, consisting of a
plantation and about twenty negroes, and some town property,
with much thrift. The lady was buxom and gay, and the union of
the couple was unblessed with children.
<pb n="135"/>
By the most insinuating manners, Col. Suggs at length succeeded
in opening the lady's eyes to a true sense of her hapless condition,
and the danger in which her property was placed, from the
improvident habits of her spouse; and, having ingeniously
deceived the unsuspecting husband into some suspicious
appearances, which were duly observed by a witness or two
provided for the purpose, he soon prevailed upon his fair hostess
to file a bill of divorce; which she readily procured under the
Colonel's auspices. Under the presence of protecting her property
from the claims of her husband's creditors, the Colonel was kind
enough to take a conveyance of it to himself; and, shortly
afterwards, the fair libellant; by which means he secured himself
from those distracting cares which beset the young legal
practitioner, who stands in immediate need of the wherewithal.</p>
               <p>Col. Suggs' prospects now greatly improved, and he saw
before him an extended field of usefulness. The whole community
felt the effects of his activity. Long dormant claims came to light;
and rights, of the very existence of which, suitors were not before
aware, were brought into practical assertion. From restlessness
and inactivity, the population became excited, inquisitive and
intelligent, as to the laws of their country; and the ruinous effects
of servile acquiescence in wrong and oppression, were averted.</p>
               <p>The fault of lawyers in preparing their cases was too
generally a dilatoriness of movement, which sometimes deferred
until it was too late, the creating of the proper impression upon
the minds of the jury. This was not the fault
<pb n="136"/>
of Col. Suggs; he always took time by the forelock. Instead of
waiting to create prejudices in the minds of the jury, until they
were in the box, or deferring until then the arts of persuasion, he
waited upon them before they were empannelled; and he always
succeeded better at that time, as they had not then received an
improper bias from the testimony. In a case of any importance, he
always managed to have his friends in the court room, so that
when any of the jurors were challenged, he might have their places
filled by good men and true; and, although this increased his
expenses considerably, by a large annual bill at the grocery, he
never regretted any expense, either of time, labor or money,
necessary to success in his business. Such was his zeal for his
clients!</p>
               <p>He was in the habit, too, of free correspondence with the
opposite party, which enabled him at once to conduct his case
with better advantage, and to supply any omissions or chasms in
the proof: and so far did he carry the habit of testifying in his own
cases, that his clients were always assured that in employing him,
they were procuring counsel and witness at the same time, and by
the same retainer. By a very easy process, he secured a large debt
barred by the statute of limitations, and completely circumvented
a fraudulent defendant who was about to avail himself of that
mendacious defence. He ante-dated the writ, and thus brought the
case clear of the statute.</p>
               <p>One of the most harassing annoyances that were inflicted
upon the emigrant community around him, was the revival
<pb n="137"/>
of old claims contracted in the State from which they came, and
which the Shylocks holding them, although they well knew that
the pretended debtors had, expressly in consideration of getting
rid of them, put themselves to the pains of exile and to the losses
and discomforts of leaving their old homes and settling in
a new country, in fraudulent violation of
this object, were ruinously seeking to enforce, even to the
deprivation of the property of the citizen. In one instance, a
cashier of a Bank in Alabama brought on claims against some of
the best citizens of the country, to a large amount, and instituted
suits on them. Col. Suggs was retained to defend them. The
cashier, a venerable-looking old gentleman, who had extorted
promises of payment, or at least had heard from the debtors
promises of payment, which their necessitous circumstances had
extorted, but to which he well knew they did not attach much
importance, was waiting to become a witness against them. Col.
Suggs so concerted operations, as to have some half-dozen of the
most worthless of the population follow the old gentleman about
whenever he went out of doors, and to be seen with him on
various occasions; and busying himself in circulating through the
community, divers reports disparaging the reputation of the
witness, got the cases ready for trial. It was agreed that
<hi rend="italics">one</hi>
verdict should settle all the cases. The defendant pleaded the
statute of limitations; and to do away with the effect of it, the
plaintiff offered the cashier as a witness. Not a single question
was asked on cross-examination; but a smile of derision, which
was accompanied by a foreordained
<pb n="138"/>
titter behind the bar, was visible on the faces of Simon and his
client, as he testified. The defendant then offered a dozen or more
witnesses, who, much to the surprise of the venerable cashier,
discredited him; and the jury, without leaving the box, found a
verdict for the defendant. The cashier was about moving for a new
trial, when, it being intimated to him that a warrant was about to
be issued for his apprehension on a charge of perjury, he
concluded not to see the result of such a process, and indignantly
left the country.</p>
               <p>The criminal practice, especially, fascinated the regards and
engaged the attention of Col. Suggs, as a department of his
profession and energies. He soon became acquainted with all the
arts and contrivances by which public justice is circumvented.
Indictments that could not be quashed, were sometimes
mysteriously out of the way; and the clerk had occasion to
reproach his carelessness in not filing them in the proper places,
when, some days after cases had been dismissed for the want of
them, they were discovered by him in some old file, or among the
executions. He was requested, or rather he volunteered in one
capital case, to draw a recognizance for a committing magistrate, as
he (Suggs) was idly looking on, not being concerned in the trial,
and so felicitously did he happen to introduce the negative particle
in the condition of the bond, that he bound the defendant, under a
heavy penalty, “<hi rend="italics">not</hi>” to appear at court and answer to the charge;
which appearance, doubtless, much against his will, and merely to
save his sureties, the defendant proceeded faithfully not to
make.</p>
               <pb n="139"/>
               <p>Col. Suggs also extricated a client and his sureties from a
forfeited recognizance, by having the defaulting defendant's
obituary notice somewhat prematurely inserted in the
newspapers; the solicitor, seeing which, discontinued
proceedings; for which service, the deceased, immediately after
the adjournment of court, returned to the officer his personal
acknowledgments: “not that,” as he expressed it, 
“it mattered
any thing to him personally, but because it
<hi rend="italics">would have
aggravated the feelings </hi>of his friends he had
left behind him, to of
let the thing rip arter he was defunck.”</p>
               <p>The most difficult case Col. Suggs ever had to manage, was to
extricate a client from jail, after sentence of death had been passed
upon him. But difficulties, so far from discouraging him, only had
the effect of stimulating his energies. He procured the aid of a
young physician in the premises—the prisoner was suddenly
taken ill—the physician pronounced the disease small pox. The
wife of the prisoner, with true womanly devotion, attended on
him. The prisoner, after a few a days, was reported dead, and the
doctor gave out that it would be dangerous to approach the
corpse. A coffin was brought into the jail, and the wife was put
into it by the physician—she being enveloped in her husband's
clothes. The coffin was put in a cart and driven off—the husband,
habited in the woman's apparel, following after, mourning
piteously, until, getting out of the village, he disappeared in the
thicket, where he found a horse prepared for him. The wife
obstinately refused to be buried in the husband's place when she got
to the grave; but the mistake
<pb n="140"/>
was discovered too late for the recapture of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The tact and address of Col. Suggs opposed such obstacles to
the enforcement of the criminal law in that part of the country,
that, following the example of the English government, when Irish
patriotism begins to create annoyances, the State naturally felt
anxious to engage his services in its behalf. Accordingly, at the
meeting of the Arkansas legislature, at its session of 184-, so soon
as the matter of the killing a member on the floor of the house, by
the speaker, with a Bowie knife, was disposed of by a resolution
of mild censure, for imprudent precipitancy, Simon Suggs, Jr.,
Esquire, was elected solicitor for the Rackensack district. Col.
Suggs brought to the discharge of the duties of his office energies
as unimpaired and vigorous as in the days of his first practice; and
entered upon it with a mind free from the vexations of domestic
cares, having procured a divorce from his wife on the ground of
infidelity, but magnanimously giving her one of the negroes, and a
horse, saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>The business of the State now flourished beyond all
precedent. Indictments multiplied: and though many of them were
not tried—the solicitor discovering, after the finding of them, as
he honestly confessed to the court, that the evidence would not
support them: yet, the Colonel could well say, with an eminent
English barrister, that if he tried fewer cases in court, he settled
more cases out of court than any other counsel.</p>
               <pb n="141"/>
               <p>The marriage of Col. Suggs, some three years after his
appointment of solicitor, with the lovely and accomplished
Che-wee-na-tubbe, daughter of a distinguished prophet and warrior,
and head-man of the neighboring territory of the Choctaw Indians,
induced his removal into that beautiful and improving country.
His talents and connections at once raised him to the councils of
that interesting people; and he received the appointment of agent
for the settlement of claims on the part of that tribe, and particular
individuals of it, upon the treasury of the United States. This
responsible and lucrative office now engages the time and talents
of Col. Suggs, who may be seen every winter at Washington,
faithfully and laboriously engaged with members of Congress and
in the departments, urging the matters of his misssion upon the
dull sense of the Janitors of the Federal Treasury.</p>
               <p>May his shadow never grow less; and may the Indians live to
get their dividends of the arrears paid to their agent.</p>

            <head>SQUIRE A. AND THE FRITTERS.</head>
            <p>Now, in the times we write of, the flourishing village of M.
was in its infancy. She had not dreamed of the great things in store
for her when she should have reached her teens, and railroad cars
crowded with visitors, should make her the belle-village of all the
surrounding country. A few log houses hastily erected and
overcrowded with inmates, alone were to be seen; nor did the inn,
either in the order or style of its architecture, or in the beauty or
comfort of its interior arrangements and accommodations, differ
from the other and less public edifices about her. In sober truth, it
must be confessed that, like the great man after whom she was
named, the promise of her youth was by no means equal to the
respectability of her more advanced age. It was the season of the
year most unpropitious to the development of the resources of the
landlord and the skill of the cook. Fall had set in, and flour made
cakes were not set out. Wheat was not then an article of home
growth, and supplies of flour were only to be got from Mobile, and
not from thence, unless when the Tombigbee river was up; so, for
a long time, the boarders and guests of the tavern had to rough it on
<hi rend="italics">corn dodger</hi>, as it
<pb n="143"/>
was called, greatly to their discontent. At length the joyful tidings
were proclaimed, that a barrel of flour had come from Mobile.
Much excitement prevailed. An animated discussion arose as to
the form in which the new aliment should be served up; and on
the motion of A., who eloquently seconded his own resolution, it
was determined that <hi rend="italics">Fritters</hi> should be had for supper that night.
Supper time dragged its slow length along: it came, however, at
last.</p>
            <p>There were a good many boarders at the Inn—some twenty or
more—and but one negro waiter, except a servant of J.T., whom
he kept about him, and who waited at table. Now, if Squire A. had
any particular weakness, it was in favor of fritters. Fritters were a
great favorite, even <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>;
but in the dearth of edibles, they were
most especially so. He had a way of eating them with molasses,
which gave them a rare and delectable relish. Accordingly, seating
himself the first at the table, and taking a position next the door
nearest to the kitchen, he prepared himself for the onslaught. He
ordered a soup-plate and filled it half full of molasses—tucked up
his sleeves—brought the public towel from the roller in the porch,
and fixed it before him at the neck, so as to protect his whole
bust—and stood as ready as the jolly Abbot over the haunch of
venison, at the widow Glendinning's, to do full justice to the
provant, when announced.</p>
            <p>Now, A. had a distinguished reputation and immense skill in
the art and mystery of fritter eating. How many he could eat at a
meal I forget, if I ever heard him say, but
<hi rend="italics">I</hi> should say—making
allowances for exaggeration in such things—from
<pb n="144"/>
the various estimates I have heard, well on to the matter of a
bushel—possibly a half a peck or so, more or less. When right
brown and reeking with fresh fat, it would take as many persons
to feed him as a carding-machine. Sam Harkness used to say, that
if a wick were run down his throat after a fritter dinner, and lit, it
would burn a week—but I don't believe that.</p>
            <p>He used no implement in eating but a fork. He passed the fork
through the fritter in such a way as to break its back, and double it
up in the form of the letter W, and pressing it through and closing
up the lines, would flourish it around in the molasses two or three
times, and then convey it, whole, to his mouth—drawing the fork
out with a sort of c-h-u-g.</p>
            <p>If A. ever intended to have his daguerreotype taken—that
was the time—for a more hopeful, complacent, benevolent cast of
countenance, I never saw than his, when the door being left a little
ajar, the cook could be seen in the kitchen, making time about the
skillet, and the fat was heard cheerfully spitting and spattering in
the pan.</p>
            <p>“But pleasures are like poppies spread,” and so forth. As
when some guileless cock-robin is innocently regaling himself in
the chase of a rainbow spangled butterfly, poising himself on
wing, and in the very act of conveying the gay insect to his
expectant spouse for domestic use, some ill-omened vulture, seated
in solitary state on a tree hard by, unfurls his wing, and swoops in
fell destruction upon the hapless warbler, leaving nothing of this
scene of peace and
<pb n="145"/>
innocence but a smothered cry and a string of feathers. So did J.T.
look upon this scene of Squire A.'s expectant and hopeful
countenance with a like and kindred malignity and fell purpose. In
plain prose,—confederating and conspiring with three other
masterful fritter eaters and Sandy, the amateur waiter at the Inn,
it was agreed that Sandy should station himself at the door, and,
as the waiting-girl came in with the fritters, he should receive the
plate, and convey the same to the other confederates for their
special behoof, to the entire neglect of the claim of Squire A. in
the premises.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the girl brought in the first plate—which was
received by Sandy—Sandy brought the plate on with stately step
close by Squire A.—the Squire's fork was raised to transfix at
least six of the smoking cakes with a contingency of sweeping the
whole platter; but the wary Sandy raised the plate high in air, nor
heeded he the Squire's cajoling tones—“Here, Sandy, here, this
way, Sandy.” Again the plate went and came, but with no better
success to the Squire. Sandy came past a third time—“I say,
Sandy, this way—this way—come Sandy—come now—do—I'll
remember you;”—but Sandy walked on like the Queen of the
West unheeding; the Squire threw himself back in his chair and
looked in the puddle of molasses in his plate sourly enough to
have fermented it. Again—again—again and yet again—the plate
passed on—the fritters getting browner and browner, and distance
lending enchantment to the view: but the Squire couldn't get a
showing. The Squire began to be
<pb n="146"/>
peremptory, and threatened Sandy with all sorts of extermination
for his contumacy; but the intrepid servitor passed along as if he
had been deaf and dumb, and his only business to carry fritters to
the other end of the table. At length Sandy came back with an
empty plate, and reported that the fritters were all out. The Squire
could contain himself no longer—unharnessing himself of the
towel and striking his fist on the table, upsetting thereby about a
pint of molasses from his plate, he exclaimed in tones of thunder,
“I'll quit this dratted house: I'll be
eternally and constitutionally
dad blamed, if I stand such infernal partiality!” and rushed out of
the house into the porch, where he met J.T., who, coolly picking
his teeth, asked the Squire how he “liked the fritters?” We
need not give the reply—as all <hi rend="italics">that</hi>
matter was afterwards
honourably settled by a board of honor.</p>

            <head>JONATHAN AND THE CONSTABLE </head>
            <p>Now, brother Jonathan was a distinguished member of the
fraternity, and had maintained a leading position in the profession
for many years, ever since, indeed, he had migrated from the land
of steady habits. His masculine sense, acuteness and shrewdness,
were relieved and mellowed by fine social habits and an original
and genial humor, more grateful because coming from an exterior
something rigid and inflexible. He had—and we hope we may be
able to say-so for thirty years yet—a remarkably acute and quick
sense of the ridiculous, and is not fonder than other humorists of
exposing a full front to the batteries of others than turning them
on his friends. Some fifty-five years has passed over his head, but
he is one of those evergreen or never green plants upon which
time makes but little impression. He has his whims and
prejudices, and being an elder of the Presbyterian church, he is
especially annoyed by a drunken man.</p>
            <p>It so happened that a certain Ned Ellett was pretty high, as
well in office as in liquor, one drizzly winter evening—during the
session of the S. Circuit Court. He had taken
<pb n="148"/>
in charge one Nash, a horse-thief, and also a tickler of rye
whiskey; and this double duty coming upon him somewhat
unexpectedly, was more than he could well sustain himself under.
The task of discharging the prisoner over, Ned was sitting by the
fire in the hall of the Choctaw House, in deep meditation upon
the mutations in human affairs, when he received a summons
from Jonathan, to come to his room, for the purpose of receiving
a letter to be carried to a client in the part of the county in which
Ned resided. It was about ten o'clock at night. Jonathan and I
occupied the same room and bed on the ground-floor of the
building, and I had retired for the night.</p>
            <p>Presently Ned came in, and took his seat by the fire. The
spirits, by this time, began to produce their usual effects. Ned
was habited in a green blanket over-coat, into which the rain had
soaked, and the action of the fire on it raised a considerable fog.
Ned was a raw-boned, rough-looking customer, about six feet high
and weighing about two hundred net—clothes, liquor, beard and
all, about three hundred. After Jonathan had given him the letter,
and Ned had critically examined the superscription, remarking
something about the handwriting, which, sooth to say, was not
copyplate—he put it in his hat, and Jonathan asked him some
question about his errand to L.</p>
            <p>“Why, Squire,” said Ned, 
“you see I had to take Nash—Nash
had been stealing of hosses, and I had a warrant for him and took
him.—Blass, Nash is the smartest feller you ever see. He knows
about most every thing and every
<pb n="149"/>
body. He knows all the lawyers, Blass—I tell you he does, and
no mistake. He was the merriest, jovialest feller you ever see, and
can sing more chronicle songs than one of these show fellers that
comes round with the suckus. He didn't seem to mind bein took
than a pet sheep. I tell you he didn't, Blass—and when I tell you
a thing, Blass, you better had believe it, you had. Blass, did you
ever hear of my telling a lie? No, not by a jug-full. Blass, aint I
an hones' man? (Yes, said B., I guess you are.)—“Guess—
Guess—<hi rend="italics">I</hi> say guess. Well, as I
was a saying, about Nash—I
asked Nash, what he was doin perusin about the country, and
Nash said he was just perusin about the country to see the climit?
But I know'd Harvey Thompson wouldn't like me to be bringin
a prisner in loose, so I put the strings on Nash, and then his
feathers drapped, and then Blass, he got to crying—and, Blass, he
told me—(blubbering) he told me about his—old mother in
Tennessee, and how her heart would be broke, and all that—and,
Blass, I'm a hard man and my feelins aint easy teched—but (here
Ned boohood right out,) Blass, I'll be—if I can bar to see a man
exhausted.”</p>
            <p>Ned drew his coat-sleeve over his eyes, blew his nose, and
snapped his fingers over the fire and proceeded: “Blass, he asked
about you and Lewis Scott, and what for a lawyer you was, and
I'll tell you jest what I told him, Blass, says I old Blass, when it
comes to hard law, Nash, knows about all the law they is—but
whether he kin norate it from the stump or not, that's the
question. Blass, show me down some of these
<pb n="150"/>
pairs of stairs. [They were on the ground-floor, but Ned, no
doubt, was entitled to think himself high.]—B. showed him out.</p>
            <p>All this time I was possuming sleep in the bed as innocent as
a lamb. Blass came to the bedside and looked inquisitively on for a
moment, and went to disrobing himself. All I could hear was a
short soliloquy—“Well, doesn't that beat all?
It's one comfort, J.
didn't hear that—I never would have heard the last of it. It's most
too good to be lost. I believe I'll lay it on him.”</p>
            <p>I got up in the morning, and as I was drawing on my left boot,
muttered as if to myself, “but whither he kin norate it from the
stump—<hi rend="italics">that's</hi> the question.”
B. turned his head so suddenly—he
was shaving, sitting on a trunk—that he came near cutting his
nose off.</p>
            <p>“You doesn't mean to say you eaves-dropped and heard that
drunken fool—do you? Remember, young man, that what you
hear said to a lawyer in conference is confidential, and don't get to
making an ass of yourself, by blabbing this thing all
over town.” I
told him “I thought I should have to norate it a little.”</p>

            <head>SHARP FINANCIERING.</head>
            <p>IN the times of 1836, there dwelt in the pleasant town of T. a
smooth oily-mannered gentleman, who diversified a commonplace
pursuit by some exciting episodes of finance—dealing
occasionally in exchange, buying and selling uncurrent money,
&amp;c. We will suppose this gentleman's name to be Thompson. It
happened that a Mr. Ripley of North Carolina, was in T., having
some $1200, in North Carolina money, and desiring to return to
the old North State with his funds, not wishing to encounter the
risk of robbery through the Creek country, in which there were
rumors of hostilities between the whites and the Indians, he
bethought him of buying exchange on Raleigh, as the safest mode
of transmitting his money. On inquiry he was referred to Mr.
Thompson, as the only person dealing in exchange in that place.
He called on Mr. T. and made known his wishes. With his
characteristic politeness, Mr. Thompson agreed to accommodate
him with a sight bill on his correspondent in Raleigh, charging him
the moderate premium of five per cent. for it. Mr. Thompson
retired into his counting-room, and
<pb n="152"/>
in a few minutes returned with the bill and a letter, which he
delivered to Mr. Ripley, at the same time receiving the money
from that gentleman plus the exchange. As the interlocutors were
exchanging valedictory compliments, it occurred to Mr.
Thompson that it would be a favor to him if Mr. Ripley would be
so kind as to convey to Mr. T.'s correspondent a package he was
desirous of sending, which request Mr. Ripley assured Mr. T. it
would afford him great pleasure to comply with. Mr. Thompson
then handed Mr. Ripley a package, strongly enveloped and sealed,
addressed to the Raleigh Banker, after which the gentlemen parted
with many polite expressions of regard and civility.</p>
            <p>Arriving without any accident or hindrance at Raleigh, Mr.
Ripley's first care was to call on the Banker and present his
documents. He found him at his office, presented the bill and
letter to him, and requested payment of the former. That, said the
Banker, will depend a good deal upon the contents of the package.
Opening which, Mr. Ripley found the identical bills, minus the
premium, he had paid Mr. T. for his bill: and which the Banker
paid over to that gentleman, who was not a little surprised to find
that the expert Mr. Thompson had charged him five per cent. for
carrying his own money to Raleigh, to avoid the risk and trouble
of which he had bought the exchange.</p>
            <p>T. used to remark that that was the safest operation, all
around, he ever knew. He lead got his exchange—the buyer had
got his bill and the money, too,—and the drawee was fully
protected! There was profit without outlay or risk.</p>

            <head>CAVE BURTON, ESQ., OF KENTUCKY.</head>
            <p>PROMINENT among the lawyers that had gathered into the new
country, was Cave Burton. Cave was a man of mark: not very
profoundly versed in the black letter, but adapting, or, more
properly, applying his talents to the slang-whanging departments
of the profession. He went in for gab. A court he could not see
the use of—the jury was the thing for him. And he was for
“<hi rend="italics">jurying</hi>” every thing,
and allowing the jury—the apostolic
twelve as he was wont to call them—a very free exercise of their
privileges, uncramped by any impertinent interference of the
court. Cave thought the judge an aristocratic institution, but the
jury was republicanism in action. He liked a free swing at them.
He had no idea of being interrupted on presumed misstatements,
or out-of-the-record revelations: he liked to be communicative
when he was speaking to them, and was not stingy with any
little scraps of gossip, or hearsay, or neighborhood reports,
which he had been able to pick up concerning the matter in hand
or the parties. He was fond, too, of giving his private
experiences—as if he were at a love-feast—and was profuse
<pb n="154"/>
of personal assurances and solemn asseverations of personal
belief or knowledge of fact and of law. He claimed Kentucky for
his native State, and for a reason that will suggest itself at once,
was called by the bar THE BLOWING CAVE. Cave had evidently
invoiced himself very high when he came out, thinking rather of
the specific than the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">ad
valorem</foreign>
               </hi> standard. He had, to hear him tell
it, renounced so many advantages, and made such sacrifices, for
the happy privilege of getting to the backwoods, that the people,
out of sheer gratitude, should have set great store by so rare an
article brought out at such cost:—but they didn't do it. He had
brought his wares to the wrong market. The market was glutted
with brass. And although that metal was indispensable, yet it was
valuable only for plating. Burton was the pure metal all through.
He might have been moulded at a brass foundry. He had not much
intellect, but what he had he kept going with a wonderful clatter.
Indeed, with his habits and ignorance, it were better not to have
had more, unless he had a great deal; for his chief capital was an
unconsciousness of how ridiculous he was making himself, and a
total blindness as to the merits of his case, which protected him,
as a somnambulist is protected from falling by being unconscious
of danger. He was just as good on a bad cause as on a good one,
and just as bad on a good side as on a bad one. The first intimation
he had of how a case ought to go, was on seeing how it had gone.
Discrimination was not his forte. Indeed, accuracy of any kind
was not his forte. He lumbered away lustily, very well content if he
<pb n="155"/>
were in the neighborhood of a fact or proposition, without
seeming to expect to he <hi rend="italics">at</hi>
the precise point. He had a good deal of
that sort of wit which comes of a bold, dashing audacity, without
fear or care; such wit as a man has who lets his tongue swing free
of all control of judgment, memory, or taste, or conscience. He
scattered like an old shot-gun, and occasionally, as he was always
firing, some of the shot would hit.</p>
            <p>A large, red-faced, burly fellow, good-natured and
unscrupulous, with a good run of anecdote and natural humor,
and some power of narrative, was Cave,—a monstrous
demagogue withal, and a free and easy sort of creature, who lived
as if he expected to-day were all the time he had to live in: and
who considered the business of the day over when he had got his
three meals with intermediate drinks.</p>
            <p>I cannot say Burton was a liar. I never knew him to fabricate a
lie “out and out”—outside of the bar;  -
his invention was hardly
sufficient for that. In one sense, his regard for truth was
considerable—indeed, so great that he spent most of his
conversation in embellishing it. It was a sponging habit he had of
building on other men's foundations; but having got a start in this
way, it is wonderful how he laid on his own work.</p>
            <p>Cave, like almost every other demagogue I ever knew, was
“considerable” in all animal appetites: he
could dispose of the
provant in a way Capt. Dalgetty would have admired, and, like
the Captain, he was not very nice as to the kind or quality of
the viands; or, rather, he had a happy
<pb n="156"/>
faculty of making up in quantity what was lacking in quality. I
don't think he ever rose from a table satisfied, though he often
rose surfeited. You might founder him before you could subdue
his appetite. He was as good in liquids as in solids. He never
refused a drink: the parable of neglected invitations would have
had no application to him if he had lived in those times. You
might wake him up at midnight to take something hot or cold,
edible or liquor, and he would take his full allowance, and smack
his lips for more. He could scent out a frolic like a raven a
carcass—by a separate instinct. He always fell in just in time. He
was not a sponge. He would as soon treat as be treated, if he had
any thing—as under the credit system he had—to treat with; but
the main thing was the provant, and loafing was one of his
auxiliaries. He had a clamorous garrison in his bowels that seemed
to be always in a state of siege, and boisterous for supplies.
Cave's idea of money was connected inseparably with bread and
meat and “sperits:” money was not the representative of value in
his political economy, but the representative of breakfast, dinner,
supper and liquor. He was never really pathetic, though always
trying it, until he came to describing, in defending against a
promissory note, the horrors of want, that is, of hunger—then he
really <hi rend="italics">was</hi> touching, for he was
earnest, and he shed tears like a
watering pot. He reckoned every calamity by the standard of the
stomach. If a man lost money, he considered it a diversion of so
much from the natural ailment.
If he lost his health, so much was
discounted from life,
<pb n="157"/>
that is, from good living: if he died, death had stopped his rations.
Cave had a mean idea of war, and never voted for a military man
in his life. It wasted too much of the fruits of the earth. An
account of a campaign never excited his horror, until the fasting of
the soldiers and the burning of the supplies was treated of—then
he felt it like a nightmare. Cave had a small opinion of clothes;
they were but a shallow, surface mode of treating the great
problem, man. He went deeper; he was for providing for the inner
man—though his idea of human nature never went beyond the
entrails. Studying human nature with him was anatomy and
physic, and testing the capacity of the body for feats of the knife
and fork. A great man with him was not so much shown by what
he could do, as by what he could hold; not by what he left, but by
what he consumed.</p>
            <p>Cave's mind was in some doubt as to things in which the
majority of men are agreed. For example, he was not satisfied that
Esau made as foolish a bargain with his brother Jacob as some
think. Before committing himself, he should like to taste the
pottage, and see some estimate of the net value of the birthright in
the beef and venison market. If the birthright were a mere matter
of pride and precedence, Cave was not sure that Esau had not
“sold” the father of Israel.</p>
            <p>If Cave had a hundred thousand dollars, he would have
laid it all out in provisions; for
<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">non constat</foreign>
               </hi>
there might be no more
made; at any rate, he would have enough to answer all the ends
and aims of life, which are to eat and drink as much as possible.</p>
            <pb n="158"/>
            <p>Cave attended the Episcopal church every Sunday when there
was service—i.e. once a month, and, though his attention was a
little drowsy during most of the services, yet he brightened up
mightily when the preacher read the prayer against famine, and for
preserving the fruits of the earth to be enjoyed in due season.</p>
            <p>Cave was some forty five years of age at the time I am
writing of:—so long had he warred on the pantry.</p>
            <p>He was an active man, indeed some part of him was always
going—jaws, tongue, hands or legs, and to a more limited extent,
brains. He never was idle. Indeed, taking in such fuel, he couldn't
well help going. Even in sleep he was not quiet. Such fighting with
unknown enemies—probably the ghosts of the animals he had
consumed;—such awful contortions of countenance, and
screams—and, when most quiet, such snorings (he once set a
passenger running down stairs with his trunk, thinking it was the
steamboat coming), you, possibly, never heard. I slept with him
one night (I blush to tell it) on the circuit, and he seemed to be in
spasms, going off at last into a suppressed rattle in the throat: I
thought he was dying, and after some trouble, woke him. He
opened his eyes, and rolled them around, like a goose egg on an
axle. “Cave,” said I, 
“Cave—can I do any thing for you?”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” was his answer. 
“Look in my saddle-bags, and get me
a black bottle of ‘red-eye.’ ”</p>
            <p>I got it; he drank almost a half pint, and went to sleep like a
child that has just received its nourishment.</p>
            <pb n="159"/>
            <p>Burton had largely stored his memory with all manner of
slang-phrases and odd expressions, whereby he gave his speech a
relish of variety somewhat at the expense of classic purity.
Indeed, his mind seemed to be a sort of water-gate, which caught
and retained the foam and trash, but let the main stream pass
through.</p>
            <p>But, as honest Bunyan hath it, we detain the reader too long
in the porch.</p>
            <p>In the Christmas week of the year of Grace, 1838, some of us
were preparing to celebrate that jovial time by a social gathering at
Dick Bowling's office. There were about a dozen of us, as fun-loving
‘<hi rend="italics">youth,</hi>’ as since the
old frolics at Cheapside or the Boar's
Head, ever met together, the judge and the State's attorney among
them. The boats had just got up, on their first trip, from Mobile,
and had brought, on a special order Dick had given, three barrels of
oysters, a demijohn of Irish whiskey, and a box of lemons. Those
were not the days of invitations: a lawyer's office, night or day,
was as public a place as the court-house, and, among the members
of the bar at that early period, there were no privileged seats at a
frolic any more than in the pit of a theatre. All came who chose.
Old Judge Sawbridge, who could tell from smelling a cork the very
region whence the liquor came, and could, by looking into the neck
of the bottle, tell the age as well as a jockey could the age of a
horse by looking into his mouth, was there before the bells had
rung for the tavern supper. Several of the rest were in before long.
Burton had not come yet. The old Judge suggested a trick,
<pb n="160"/>
which was to get Burton to telling one of his Kentucky yarns and,
as he was in the agony of it, to withdraw, one by one, and eat up
all the oysters. We agreed to try it, but doubted very much the
success of the experiment; although the Judge seemed to be
sanguine.</p>
            <p>Dropping in, one by one, at last all came, filling the room
pretty well. Among them was Cave. That domestic bereavement
which had kept him from such a gathering, were a sad one. He
entered the room in high feather. He was in fine spirits, ardent
and animal. If he had been going, twenty years before, to a
trysting-place, he could not have been in a gayer frame of mind.
He came prepared. He had ravished himself from the supper
table, scarcely eating any thing—three or four cups of coffee,
emptying the cream-pitcher of its sky-blue milk, a card of spare-ribs
and one or two feet of stuffed sausages, or some such matter;
a light condiment of “cracklin bread,” and
a half pint of hog-brains
thrown in just by way of parenthesis. He merely took in these
trifles by way of sandwich, to provoke his appetite for the main
exercises of the evening. When he came in the fire was booming
and crackling—a half cord of hickory having been piled upon the
broad hearth. The night was cold, clear, and frosty.</p>
            <p>The back room adjoining was as busy as a barracks, in the
culinary preparations. The oysters, like our clients, were being
forced, with characteristic reluctance, to shell out. And as the
knife went tip, tip, tip, on the shells, Cave's mouth watered
like the bivalve's, as he caught the sound—more delicious music
to his ears than Jenny Lind and the
<pb n="161"/>
whole Italian troupe could give out. His spirits rose in this
congenial atmosphere like the spirits in a barometer. He was soon in
a gale, as if he had been taking laughing gas. Now Cave was as fond
of oysters as a seal. A regiment of such men on the sea-shore, or
near the oyster banks, would have exterminated the species in a
season. The act against the destruction of the oyster ought to
have embraced Cave in a special clause of interdiction from their
use. He used to boast that he and D.L. had never failed to break
an oyster cellar in Tuscaloosa whenever they made a run on it.</p>
            <p>Judge Sawbridge made a pass at him as soon almost as he was
seated. He commenced by inquiring after some Kentucky
celebrities—Crittenden, Hardin, Wickliffe, &amp;c., whom he found
intimate friends of Cave; and then he asked Cave to tell him the
anecdote he had heard repeated, but not in its particulars, of the
Earthquake-story. He led up to Cave's strong suit: for if there was
one thing that Cave liked better than every thing else, eating and
drinking excepted, it was telling a story; and if he liked telling any
one story better than any other, it was the Earthquake-story. This
story was, like Frank Plummer speech on the Wiscasset
collectorship, interminable; and, like Frank's speech, the principal
part of it bore no imaginable relation to the ostensible subject. No
mortal man had ever heard the end of this story: like Coleridge's
soliloquies, it branched out with innumerable suggestions, each in
its turn the parent of others, and these again breeding a new
spawn, so that the further he travelled the less he went on. Like
Kit Kunker's dog howling after
<pb n="162"/>
the singing master and getting tangled up in the tune, the
<hi rend="italics">denouement</hi> was lost in the episodes.
What the story was
originally, could not be conjectured; for Cave had gone over the
ground so often, that the first and many subsequent traces were
rubbed out by later footprints. Cave, however, refreshing himself
with about a pint of hot-stuff, rose, turned his back to the fire,
and, parting his coat-tail, and squatting two or three times as was
his wont when in the act of speaking, began</p>
            <div type="subchapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
               <head>The Earthquake-story.</head>
               <p>We can only give it in <hi rend="italics">our</hi> way,
and only such parts as we can
remember, leaving out most of the episodes, the casual
explanations and the slang; which is almost the play of Hamlet
with the Prince of Denmark omitted. But, thus emasculated, and
Cave's gas let off, here goes a report about as faithful as a
Congressman's report of his spoken eloquence when nobody
was listening in the House.</p>
               <p>*     *     *       *       *      *       *      *      *</p>
               <p>“Well, Judge, the thing happened in 1834, in Steubenville,
Kentucky, where I was raised. I and Ben Hardin were
prosecuting the great suit, which probably you have heard of,
<hi rend="italics">Susan Beeler</hi> vs. <hi rend="italics">Samuel
Whistler</hi>, for breach of promise of
marriage. The trial came on, and the court-house was crowded.
Every body turned out, men, women, and children; for it was
understood I was to close the argument in reply to Tom Marshall
and Bob Wickliffe. I had been
<pb n="163"/>
speaking about three hours and a half, and had just got to my full
speed—the genius licks were falling pretty heavy. It was an
aggravated case. Susan, her mother and three sisters were crying
like babies; her old father, the preacher, was taking on too, pretty
solemn; and the women generally were going it pretty strong on
the briny line. The court-house was as solemn as a camp-meeting
when they are calling up the mourners. I had been giving them a
rousing, soul-searching appeal on the moral question, and had
been stirring up their consciences with a long pole. I had touched
them a little on the feelings—‘affections’  -
‘broken-hearts’
—‘pining away’—‘patience on a
  monument,’ and so forth; but I
hadn't probed them deep on these tender points. It isn't the right
way to throw them into spasms of emotion: reaction is apt to
come. Ben Hardin cautioned me against this. Says Ben, ‘Cave, tap
them gently and milk them of their brine easy. Let the pathetics
sink into 'em like a spring shower.’ I saw the sense of it and took
the hint. I led them gently along, not drawing more than a tear a
minute or so: and when I saw their mouths opening with mine, as
I went on, and their eyes following mine, and winking as I winked,
I would put it down a little stronger by way of a clincher. [Hello,
Dick, ain't they nearly all opened? I believe I would take a few
raw by way of relish.”]</p>
               <p>“No,” Dick said: “they would be ready
after a while.” Here
Cave took another drink of the punch and proceeded.</p>
               <p>“I say—old Van Tromp Rawkat was Judge. You knew old
Ramkat, Judge—didn't you? No? Well, <hi rend="italics">you</hi>
                  <pb n="164"/>
ought to have known him. He was the bloodiest tyrant alive. I
reckon the old cuss has fined me not less than $500.”</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Sawbridge</hi>.—“What for, Cave?”</p>
               <p>“Why, for contempt at ten dollars a clip—that was old
Ramkat's tariff; and if every other man had been fined the same for
<hi rend="italics">contempt</hi> of Van Tromp, the fines
would pay off the national
debt. Old Ram had a crazy fit for fining persons. He thought he
owed it to the people to pay off all the expenses of the judicial
system by fines. He was at it all the time. His fines against the
sheriff and clerk amounted to not less than ten per cent. on their
salaries. If a court passed without fining somebody for contempt,
he thought it was a failure of court, and he called a special term.
Every thing was a contempt: a lawyer couldn't go out of court
without asking leave; and the lawyers proposed, at a barmeeting,
to get a shingle and write on one side of it “In,”
and on the other
“Out,” like an old-field school. He fined Tid
Stiffness for refusing
to testify in a gambling case $10; and then asked
him again in the
politest and most obsequious tones—if he hadn't better testify?
Tid, thinking it a matter of choice, said ‘No.’
Old Ram nodded to the
clerk, who set Tid down for another five. Ram got still more
polite, and suggested the question again—and kept on
till <hi rend="italics">he bid him up to</hi>$250; and
then told him what he had done, and then
adjourned the case over, with Tid in custody, till next morning.
Tid came into measures when the case was called, and agreed to
testify, and wanted old Van to let him off
<pb n="165"/>
with the fines; but Ram wouldn't hear to it. The clerk, however,
suggested that, on looking over the tallies, he found he had scored
him down twice on one bid. Ram remarked that, as there seemed
to be some question about it, and as Tid had been a good
customer, he would split the difference with him and deduct a V;
and then, in order to make the change even, he fined old
Taxcross, the clerk, five dollars for not making up the entry
right; but to let it come light on him, as he had a large family,
allowed him to make it off of Tid by making separate entries of
the fines—thus swelling his fees.</p>
               <p>“Oh, I tell you, old Ramkat was the bloodiest tyrant this side
of France. I reckon that old cuss has cheated my clients out of
half a million of dollars, by arbitrarily and officiously interfering
to tell the juries the law, when I had got them all with me on the
facts. There was no doing any thing with him. He would lay the
law down so positive, that he could instruct a jury out of a
stock,—a little, bald-headed, high-heel-booted, hen-pecked son of
thunder! Fining and sending to the penitentiary were the chief
delights of his insignificant life. Did not the little villain once say,
in open court, that the finding of a bill of indictment was a half
conviction, and it ought to be law that the defendant ought to be
convicted if he couldn't get a
unanimous verdict from the petty
jury? Why, Judge, he convicted a client of mine for stealing a calf.
I proved that the fellow was poor and had nothing to eat, and
stole it in self defence of his life. 'Twouldn't do: he convicted
him, or made the jury do it.
<pb n="166"/>
And old Ram told the fellow he should sentence him for five years.
I plead with him to reduce the time. The boy's father was in court,
and was weeping: I wept:—even old Ramkat boohoo'd outright. I
thought I had him this time; but what did he do? Says he, ‘Young
man, your vile conduct has done so much wrong, given your
worthy father so much pain, and given your eloquent counsel so
much pain, and this court so much pain—I really must ENLARGE
your time to TEN years.’ And for stealing a calf! Egad, if
<hi rend="italics">I</hi> was
starving, <hi rend="italics">I'd</hi> steal a calf—yes, if I
had been in Noah's ark and the
critter was the seed calf of the world! [I say, where is Dick
Bowling? Them oysters certainly must be ready by this time;—it
seems to me I've smelt them for the last half hour.”]</p>
               <p>“No,” the judge told him; “the oysters were not ready—
they were stewing a big tureen full at once.”</p>
               <p>Cave called for crackers and butter, and, through the course of
the evening, just in a coquetting way, disposed of about half a
tray full of dough, and half a pound of Goshen butter.</p>
               <p>The reader will understand that during the progress of this
oration, though at different times, the members withdrew to the
back room and ‘oystered.’</p>
               <p>“Well, but,” said Tom Cottle—
“about the earthquake?”</p>
               <p>“Yes—true—exactly—just so—my mind
is so disturbed by
the idea that those oysters will be stewed out of all flavor,
that I ramble. Where was I? Yes, I recollect now. I was
commenting on Tom Marshall's attack on Molly Muggin's
<pb n="167"/>
testimony. Moll was our main witness. She was an Irish
servant girl, and had peeped through the key-hole of the parlor
door, and seen the breach of promise going on upon the sofa.
Well, I was speaking of Ireland, Emmet, Curran and so on, and I
had my arm stretched out, and the jury were agape—old Ramkat
leaning over the bench—and the crowd as still as death. When,
what <hi rend="italics">should</hi> happen? Such a clatter and
noise above stairs, as if
the whole building were tumbling down. It seems that a jury was
hung, up stairs, in the second story—six and six—a dead lock, on
a case of Jim Snipes <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Jerry Legg for
a bull yearling; all Nubbin
Fork was in excitement about it;—forty witnesses on a side, not
including impeaching and sustaining witnesses. The sheriff had
just summoned the witnesses from the muster-roll at random;
fourteen swore one way, and twenty-four the other, as to identity
and ownership; and it turned out the calf belonged to neither;
there was more perjury than would pale the lower regions to
white heat to hear it. One witness swore”—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Sawbridge</hi>.—“But, Cave,
about the case <hi rend="italics">you</hi> were trying.”</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Cave</hi>.—“Yes—about that.
Well, the jury wanted to hear <hi rend="italics">my</hi>
speech, and the sheriff wouldn't let them out. He locked the door
and came down. One of them, Sim Coley, kicked at the door so
hard that the jar broke the stove-pipe off from the wires in the
Mason's Lodge-room above, and about forty yards of stove-pipe,
about as thick round as a barrel, came lumbering over the
banisters, and fell, with a
<pb n="168"/>
crash like thunder; in the grand jury-room below, and then came
rolling down stairs, four steps at a leap, bouncing like a rock from
a mountain side.”</p>
               <p>Here Sam Watson inquired how such a long pipe could get
down a “pair of stairs,” and how much broader
a staircase of a
Kentucky court-house was than a turnpike road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Cave</hi>.—“Of course, I
 meant that it onjointed, and one or more of
the joints rolled down. A loose, gangling fellow like you, Sam,
ought to see no great difficulty <hi rend="italics">in any
thing</hi> being onjointed. I could
just unscrew you”—</p>
               <p>“Order! Order!” interposed Judge Sawbridge. “No
interruption of the speaker; Mr. Burton has the floor.”</p>
               <p>“Well,” continued Cave, “I had prepared
 the minds of the
audience for a catastrophe, and this, coming as it did, had a fearful
effect; but the hung jury coming down stairs on the other side of
the building from the lodge, and by the opposite stairway, hearing
the noise, started to running down like so many wild buffalo. A
general hubbub arose below—old Ramkat rose in his place, with a
smile at the prospect of so much good fining.
‘Sheriff,’ said he,
‘bring before me the authors of that confusion.’
Just then the
plaster of the ceiling of the court room began to fall, and the
women raised a shriek. Old Ramkat bellowed up  -
‘Sheriff,
consider the whole audience fined ten dollars a piece, and mind
and collect the fees at the door before they depart. Clerk, consider
the whole court house fined—women and children half price—and
take down their names. Sheriff, see to the doors being closed.’ But
just then another
<pb n="169"/>
section of the stove-pipe came thundering down, and
about the eighth of an acre of plastering fell, knocking down sixty
or seventy men and women; and the people in the galleries came
rushing down, some jumping over into the crowd below; and a
sheet of plastering, about as large as a tray, came down from above
the chandelier, and struck old Ramkat over the head, and knocked
him out of the judge's stand into the clerk's box; and he struck old
Taxcross on the shoulders, and turned over about a gallon of ink
on the records. Then Pug Williams, the bailiff, shouted out,
‘<hi rend="italics">Earthquake!</hi>  -
 <hi rend="italics">Earthquake!</hi>’ and all the women went into
hysterics; and Pug, not knowing what to do, caught the bell-rope,
and began furiously to ring the bell. Such shouts of ‘murder! fire!
fire!’ you never heard. There was a rush to the doors, but the
day being cold they were closed, and of course on the inside,
and the crowd pressed in such a mass and mess against them,
that, I suppose, there was a hundred tons' pressure on them, and
they could not be got open. I was standing before the jury, and
just behind them was a window, but it was down: I leaped over
the jury, carried them before me”—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Watson</hi>.—“The first
time you ever carried them, Cave.”</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Cave</hi>.—“Not by a jug full.
I bowed my neck and jumped
leap-frog through the window, carried the sash out on my neck,
and landed safe in the yard, cutting a jugular vein or two half
through, and picked myself up and ran, with the sash on my
neck, up street, bleeding like a butcher, and
<pb n="170"/>
shouting murder at every jump. I verily thought I never should
see supper time.</p>
               <p>“In the mean time the very devil was to pay in the
courthouse. Old Ramkat, half stunned ran up the steps to the
judge's platform, near which was a window, hoisted it and
jumped, like a flying mullet, over on to the green, thirty feet
below, sprained his ankle and fell. Frank Duer, once the most
eloquent man at the bar, but who had fattened himself out of his
eloquence—weighing three hundred and ninety, and so fat that he
could only wheeze out his figures of speech, and broke down from
exhaustion of wind in fifteen minutes—followed suit, just
squeezing himself through the same window, muttering a prayer
for his soul that was just about leaving such comfortable lodgings,
came thundering down on the ground, jarring it like a real
earthquake, and bounced a foot, and fell senseless on Ramkat.
Ramkat, feeling the jar, and mashed under Frank, thought the
earthquake had shook down the gable end of the court-house and
it had fell on him. So he thought fining time was over with him. He
hollered out in a smothered cry, ‘Excavate the Court!—Excavate
the Court!’ But nobody would do it, but let him sweat and
smother for four hours.</p>
               <p>“Then Luke Casey, a little, short, bilious, collecting attorney,
as pert and active as if he was made out of watch springs and
gum-elastic, and who always carried a green bag with old
newspapers and brickbats in it, and combed his hair over his face
to look savage, so as to get up a reputation for being a good
hand at dirty work—Luke
<pb n="171"/>
was ciphering the interest on a little grocery account of fifteen
dollars; he had appealed from a justice's court, and had a big
deposition, taken in the case, all the way from New-York, in his
hand; he sprung over three benches of the bar at a leap, and
grabbed his hand on Girard Moseley's head to make another leap
towards a window—going as if there was a prospect of a fee
ahead, and the client was about leaving town. He leaped clear over,
but carried Girard's wig with him. Now Girard was a widower, in a
remarkable state of preservation, and of fine constitution, having
survived three aggravated attacks of matrimony. He pretended to
practise law; but his real business was marrying for money. He
had got well off at it, though he never got more than four thousand
dollars with any one wife. He did lousiness on the principle of
‘quick returns and short profits.’ He
pretended to be thirty and the
rise, but was, at the least, fifty. He prided himself on his hair, a
rich, light sorrel, sleek and glossy, and greased over with
peppermint, cinnamon, and all sorts of sweet smells. He smelt
like a barber's shop; and such a polite, nice, easy fellow,
<hi rend="italics">to</hi> BE sure,
was Girard. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, and yet let him get
hold of a dime, and he griped it so hard you might hear the eagle
squall. He only courted rich old maids in infirm health, and was
too stingy ever to raise a family. He was very sweet on old Miss
Julia Pritcher, a <hi rend="italics">girl</hi> of about
thirty-five, who was lank, hysterical,
and, the boys said, fitified; and who had just got about five
thousand dollars from her aunt, whom she had served about fifteen
years as upper servant,
<pb n="172"/>
but who was now gone the old road. Nobody ever
thought of Girard's wearing a wig. He pretended it was
<hi rend="italics">Jayne's
Hair Elixir</hi> that brought it out. Fudge! But Luke caught him by
the top-knot, and peeled his head like a white onion. He left him
as bald as a billiard-ball—not a hair between his scalp and heaven.
Luke took the wig, and hastily, without thinking what he was
doing, filed it in the deposition. Mosely had brought Jule Pritcher
there, and she was painted up like a doll: her withered old face
streaked like a June apple. She needn't have put herself to that
trouble for Girard; he would have married her in her winding-sheet,
if she had been as ugly as original sin, and only had enough
breath in her to say yes to the preacher.</p>
               <p>“And now the fury began to grow outside. The smoke,
rushing out of the window of the lodge-room, and the cry of fire
brought out the fire-engines and companies, and the rag, tag and
bob-tail boys and negroes that follow on shouting, with great glee,
‘fire! fire! fire!’ along the streets. Ting-a-ling
 came on the
engines—there wore two of them—until they brought up in the
court-house yard; one of them in front, the other at the side or
gable end. It was some time before the hose could be fixed right;
every fellow acting as captain, and <hi rend="italics">all</hi>
being in the way of <hi rend="italics">the rest</hi>.
Wood Chuck, a tanner's journeyman—a long, slim, yellow-breeched
fellow, undertook to act as engineer of engine No. 1. 
‘Play in at the
windows!’ cried the crowd outside, ‘there's fire
 <hi rend="italics">there</hi>’—and play
it was. They worked the arms of the thing lustily—no two
pulling or letting down at the, same
<pb n="173"/>
time, until at last, the water came. Wood guided pretty well for a
first trial, first slinging the pipe around and scattering the crowd.
But, just as they came pouring out of the window, thick as bees,
he got his aim, and he sent the water in a sluice into the window;
the engine had a squirt like all blazes; and as Chuck levelled the
pipe and drew a bead on them, and as it shot into the faces of the
crowd—vip, vip, vip—they fell back shouting murder, as if
they had been shot from the window-sill. Old Girard had got hold
of Jule and brought her to, and was bringing her, she clinging with
great maidenly timidity to him, and he hugging her pretty tight,
and they, coming to the window—the rest falling back—Chuck
had a fair fire at them. He played on old Girard to some
purpose—his bald head was a fair mark, and the water splashed
and scattered from it like the foam on a figure head. The old
fellow's ears rang like a conch shell for two years afterwards.
Chuck gave Jule one swipe on one side of her head that drove a
bunch of curls through the window opposite, and which washed
all the complexion off that cheek, and the paint ran down the
gullies and seams like blood; the other side was still rosy. The
only safe place was to get down on the floor and let the water fly
over. Old Girard never got over the tic-doloreux and rheumatism
he got that day. The other engine played in the other window; and
the more they played, the more the people inside shouted and
hollered; and the more they did that, the more Chuck and Bill
Jones, the engineer of No. 2, <hi rend="italics">came to
their relief</hi>. It was estimated
that at least a thousand
<pb n="174"/>
hogsheads of water were played into that court-house: indeed, I
believe several small boys were drowned.</p>
               <p>“Some one shouted out for an axe to cut through the front
door. One was brought. A big buck negro struck with all his
might, with the back of the axe, to knock it off its hinges; but
there were at least twenty heads pushed up against the door, and
these were knocked as dead by the blow as ever you saw a fish
under the ice.”</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Sawbridge</hi>.—“Were they
all killed?”</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italics">Cave</hi>.—“All? No  -
not all. Most of them came to, after a
while. Indeed, I believe there was only three that were
buried—and a tinner's boy, Tom Tyson, had his skull fractured;
but they put silver plate in the cracks, and he got over it—a few
brains spilt out, or something of the sort—but his appetite was
restored.</p>
               <p>“By the way, we had some fun when the trial of Luke
Casey's little case came on. Moseley was on the other side, and
came into court with his head tied up in a bandanna handkerchief.
He smiled when some of Luke's proof was offered, and Luke, a
little nettled, drew out the deposition, and with an air of triumph
said, ‘Perhaps, Mr. Moseley, you will laugh at
this,’ opening the
deposition; as he opened it the wig fell out, and, every body
recognizing it as Moseley's, a laugh arose which was only
stopped by old Ramkat's fining all around the table. Squire
Moseley vamosed and left Luke to get a judgment, and the credit
of a joke, of which he was innocent as Girard's head was of the
hair.</p>
               <pb n="175"/>
               <p>“Well, boys, I reckon you would all like to know what
became of my case. You see”—</p>
               <p>Here Dick Bowling, smacking his lips, remarked that the
oysters were very fine.</p>
               <p>“Oysters!” said Cave. 
“Have you been eating the oysters?”</p>
               <p>Dick said he had.</p>
               <p>Cave jumped to the back door at one bound, and called to the
servant—“Jo, I say, Jo—get mine ready this minute—a few
dozen raw—a half bushel roasted, and all the balance
stewed—with plenty of soup; I'll season them myself; and put
on plenty of crackers, butter and pickles. Be quick, Jo,
old fel.”</p>
               <p>Jo made his appearance, hat in hand, and answered; “Why,
Mas Cave, dey's all gone dis hour past; de gem'men eat ebery
one up.”</p>
               <p>“The devil they have!” said Cave. 
“Gentlemen,” he
continued, turning to the crowd, “is this true?”</p>
               <p>“Yes,” replied the Judge. “Cave, I
thought you were so
interested telling the story, that you would prefer not to be
interrupted.”</p>
               <p>The exclamatory imprecation which Cave lavished upon his
soul, his eyes, and the particular persons present, and humanity
generally, would not be befitting these chaste pages. He left
without any valedictory salutations of a complimentary or
courteous tenor. And he did not recover his composure until
he removed a tray full of blood-puddings,
<pb n="176"/>
sweetbread, kidneys and the like soporific viands, which had
once graced the landlord's larder.</p>
               <p>Speaking of the entertainment afterwards, Cave said he
did not care a <hi rend="italics">dern</hi> for the oysters,
but it pained him to think that
men he took to be his friends, should have done him a secret
injury.</p>

            <head>JUSTIFICATION AFTER VERDICT.</head>
            <p>THE Fall assizes of the year 184-, came on in the East Riding,
and my friend, Paul Beechim, found himself duly indicted before
Judge C., for an assault and battery committed on the body of one
Phillip Cousins, in the peace of the State then and there being. I
felt more than ordinary interest in the case; the aforesaid Paul
being a particular friend of mine, and, moreover, the case
presenting some singular and mysterious features. The defendant
was one of the best-natured and most peaceable citizens of the
county, and, until recently, before this
<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">ex parte</foreign>
               </hi>
fighting, had been
on terms of intimacy and friendship with the gentleman upon
whom the assault was made. The assault was of a ferocious
character; no one knew the cause of it; though every one knew,
from the character of Beechim, that some extraordinary
provocation had been given him: it was impossible to guess what
it was. I was no better informed than the rest. When Beechim
came to employ me in the case, I tried to possess myself of the
facts. To all inquiries he only replied, that he had acted as he had
done for good and sufficient reasons—
<pb n="178"/>
but that he did not choose to say more. I told him that it was
impossible for me to defend him unless he would place me in
possession of the facts, and assured him that whatever he
communicated should be held in strict professional and personal
confidence. But nothing I could say produced any change in his
determination. I was about abandoning his case, remarking to him
that if he felt no confidence in his counsel, or not enough to induce
him to tell him the facts, he might be assured that it was no less his
interest than my wish, that he should go where he would be better
suited. But he persisted that it was from no want of confidence in
me that he refused, and that he regarded me with the same feelings
of friendship he had always felt for me, and concluded by telling
me that if I refused to take his case he should employ no other
lawyer, but would let the matter proceed without defence. I told
him I did not see any hope of his escaping severe punishment as
the case stood; to which he replied that he expected it, but that he
hoped I would, if it were possible, prevent his being sent to jail.
The case came up in the regular course of things and was tried. The
facts were brought out plainly enough. The assault was made in
public, on the square; the weapon a large cane, with which the
defendant had given Cousins an awful beating, gashing his head and
causing the blood to flow very freely over his clothes. The only
words said by Beechim in the course of the affair were, “How,
d-n you, how do you like <hi rend="italics">that</hi>
pineapple sop?” spoken just as
he was leaving the prostrate Cousins. Of course on such
testimony, the jury found the
<pb n="179"/>
defendant guilty: and the court retained Beechim in custody until
some leisure was given it to fix the punishment, which, by the
statute, the court was bound to impose.</p>
            <p>Judge C. was something of a martinet in his line. He was a
pretty good disciplinarian and kept the police business of the
court in good order. There had been of late many violations of the
law and a growing disposition was felt by the people and the
courts to put down these excesses; but Beechim was so popular,
and withal, so kind-hearted and gentlemanly a fellow, that a great
deal of sympathy was felt for him, and a general wish that he
might in some way get out of the scrape.</p>
            <p>Among the peculiarities of Judge C. was an itching curiosity.
He was always peeping under the curtain of a case to see if he
could not find something behind; and felt not a little disappointed
and vexed when the examination stopped short of bringing out all
the facts and incidents, the relations of the parties and the like.</p>
            <p>He had been struck with the expression used by Beechim—
“pine-apple sop,” and was evidently uneasy in
 mind in his present
state of inability to unravel it. The first pause in the
cause he was
next trying gave him an opportunity of calling me to him: I came
of course: Said he, “B— what did that fellow mean by 
‘pine-apple Sop?’ ” 
I told him there was a mystery about it which I could
not explain. “A mystery, ha! Well, now, here, B -, in confidence
—just tell me; it shan't go any farther—of course, you know—
just give me an item of it.” I told him I really was ignorant of
<pb n="180"/>
it—as was every one else; but I felt sure that it was some thing
that would place my client's conduct in a better light, though he
obstinately refused to tell it to me. The judge then assured me I
had better see my client, and get him to state it to the court; that
he would give all proper weighs to it in fixing the punishment, but
that as the case stood, he should have to make an example of him.
I took Paul aside and told him what the judge had said, and
added my own counsel to his Honor's, but with no effect. He still
mildly but resolutely refused to make any explanation. I felt a
good deal vexed at this, as it seemed to me, most unreasonable
conduct. Revolving the thing in my mind, I got more and more
bothered the more I thought about it. I began to look at the
circumstances more narrowly; that it was no sham or trick was
very evident; no man would have taken such a beating for fun: that
the provocation did not touch any domestic relations which the
defendant might have desired to keep from being exposed, was
apparent from the fact that my client had no relatives in the
country, and the only girl he ever went to see was Cousins's
sister. There were two facts I made sure of: the first that this
meeting was immediately after Cousins's return from New
Orleans, which occurred a few days after Beechim himself had
arrived from that city; the second, that Cousins had kept out of
the way and had received a note shortly before court from
Beechim. I made up my mind that the quarrel originated in
something that had occurred between the parties in New Orleans. I
happened to know, too, that Samuel Roberts, Esq., one of
<pb n="181"/>
the 'cutest chaps we had about town, and ‘up to
trap’ in whatever
was stirring wherever he happened to be, was in New Orleans at
the time these young gentlemen were there; and I determined to
get the facts out of him if I could. Shortly after breakfast, on the
next day after the verdict,—the judgment still delayed, partly by
my request and partly by the judge's curiosity being yet
unappeased—I sallied out with a package in my hand as if going
to the post office. Sam was on the street. I knew if there was any
thing to be concealed by him, the only way to get it was by a
<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">coup d'etat</foreign>
               </hi>.
So half-passing him, I turned suddenly on him, and
putting my hand on his shoulder, and looking him in the eye,
broke into a laugh, saying, “Well, Sam, that quarrel between
Beechim and Cousins in New Orleans, and the—thing it grew out
of—didn't it beat any thing you ever heard of?—Wasn't it the
queerest affair that ever happened? I am defending Beechim, and,
would you believe it?—he never told me up to last night what
was the cause of the fight? Don't the whole thing look curious?”
I said this very flippantly with a knowing air, as if I knew all
about it. Sam's eyes twinkled as he answered? “Well, B-, isn't it
the blamedest piece of business <hi rend="italics">you</hi>
ever heard of?” “Yes,” said I,
“it is; and we must get Paul out of this scrape—the judge is
viperish, and, if we don't do something, six months in jail is the
very lowest time we can get Paul off with. Now, Sam, just step
here—tell me the particulars of the matter in New
Orleans as <hi rend="italics">you</hi>
understand them; for you know any discrepancy between Paul's
statement and yours might hurt things
<pb n="182"/>
mightily, and I want to know exactly how the case stands.”
“No,” said Sam, “I can't do it.
 I promised Paul, on honor, that I
wouldn't mention it to a soul, and I won't do it unless I am
compelled. So you needn't ask me unless you bring a note from
Paul relieving me from the pledge.” I saw he was determined, and
it was useless to press the point. I had a vague idea that a woman
was mixed up in the matter, and was afraid of some exposure of
that sort; so I let out blind to find out: “Well, well, Sam, if you
stand on points of honor, of course that ends it;—but just explain
this thing—how did <hi rend="italics">the girl</hi> behave
under the circumstances? you
know it was calculated to be a little trying, and the thing being so
sudden and the parties being strangers, too,—you understand?”
and I looked several volumes, and searched narrowly for some
answer. Sam merely replied, “Why, as to
<hi rend="italics">the girl</hi> opposite, if
you mean her, she behaved very well. She laughed a little at first,
but when Paul showed how it hurt him, she seemed to feel for
him, and let the rest take all the laugh.”
I felt better satisfied with
this explanation, and determined on my course.</p>
            <p>The judge, in the mean time, was on thorns of anxiety. He had
been conversing with the clerk, and sheriff, and State's attorney,
but to no purpose; they only inflamed his curiosity the more; the
mystery seemed inscrutable. He came to my room twice that
night—but I was out—to see me on the subject. Early in the
morning, as I was taking a comfortable snooze, his Honor came
into my room, and woke me up. “Get up, B-, get up—why do
you sleep so late in
<pb n="183"/>
the morning?—it's a bad habit.” (The judge was in the habit of
sleeping until a late breakfast. I got up, and before I could get on
my pantaloons, he opened the conversation. “B.,”
said he, “this
thing about young Beechim distresses me a great deal. I feel really
concerned about his case; and if you will tell me now how that
difficulty originated, I—I—I—shall feel better about it. My
mind <hi rend="italics">would</hi>—yes, my mind would be
relieved. Of course, B., <hi rend="italics">you</hi>
know all about the matter, and I assure you it will be to the
interest of your client to reveal the whole affair—de-ci-ded-ly his
interest. What is it?” I told him I really did not know, and could
not find out as yet; but I thought I had got the clue to the
mystery, and, if he would aid me, it could all be brought to light; I
was convinced, that if it did come out, it would make decidedly
for the benefit of Paul, whom I knew to be incapable of making a
wanton assault upon any one, especially upon Cousins. The judge
told me I might rely on him, and he would see if any one dared to
hold back any thing which it was proper to bring out. He was so
communicative as to assure me that, generally speaking, he was a
man of but little curiosity: indeed, he sometimes reproached
himself, and his wife often reproached him, for not knowing
things;—that is, he said, he meant by “not knowing things”
—personal matters, gossip, and so forth—and that he never got
any thing but what was played like a trapball all over town; but,
in this case, as a mere matter of speculation, he confessed he
<hi rend="italics">did</hi>
feel desirous of unravelling the riddle; in fact, it preyed on his
mind; he couldn't rest last night; he
<pb n="184"/>
even dreamed of a fellow funnelling
<hi rend="italics">him</hi> and pouring down <hi rend="italics">his</hi>
throat a bottle of spirits of turpentine, and asking him as he left
him gagged, how <hi rend="italics">he</hi> liked
“<hi rend="italics">that</hi> pine-apple sop.” His Honor then
went into many ingenious theories and surmises in elucidation of
the mystery; but I felt assured that his explication was more
fanciful than true.</p>
            <p>Finding a great indisposition still, to reveal any thing, on the
part of Beechim, and fearing that, if he were present, he would
interpose objections to the presentation of the proof as to the
provocation, I arranged it so that the sheriff should detain Paul
from the court-house until I could get the testimony in.</p>
            <p>In order to a more perfect understanding of the matter, I had
as well state here, that Beechim was a young gentleman who had
some two or three years before “located” in the county, and was
doing a general land agency and collecting business, surveying
lands, &amp;c., having before been engaged as principal in an academy.
He had graduated at the college at Knoxville, Tennessee, and
cherished sentiments of great reverence for his venerable
 <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">alma
mater</foreign>
               </hi>, which showed a very lively condition of the moral
sensibilities. He thought very highly of the respectable society of
that somewhat secluded village, and conceived a magnified idea of
the burgh as a most populous, wealthy and flourishing
metropolis. I verily believe he considered Knoxville at once the
Athens and Paris of America, abounding in all the refinements,
and shining with the polish of a rare and exquisite
civilization—the seat of learning, the home of luxury,
<pb n="185"/>
and the mart of commerce. Letters, and arts, and great men, and
refined modes, and cultivated manners, and women of a type that
they never before had been moulded into, there abounded, in his
partial fancy prodigal of such generous appreciation. The
magnificent self-delusion of dear old Captain Jackson,
immortalized by Elia, scarcely equalled the hallucination of Paul
<hi rend="italics">quoad</hi> the sights and scenes,
the little short of celestial glory of
and about the <hi rend="italics">city</hi> of Knoxville,
as he would persist in calling that
out-of-the-way, not-to-be-gotten-to, Sleepy-Hollow town, fifty
miles from the Virginia line, and a thousand miles from any where
else. I speak of it in pre-railroad times. Paul had been assiduous in
the cultivation of manners. His model was, of course,
<hi rend="italics">that</hi> he
found at Knoxville. He had a great penchant for fashionable life,
and fashionable life was the life of the coteries, the upper-tens of
Knoxville. Rusticity and vulgarity were abominations to him. To
go back to Knoxville and get to the tip of the ton there, was the
extreme top-notch of Paul's ambition. Apart from this high-church
Knoxvillism, Paul was an excellent fellow, somewhat vain,
sensitive to a fault, and thin-skinned; somewhat pretentious as to
fashion, style and manners; indeed, the girls had got to regard him
as a sort of village Beau Brummell, “the glass of fashion and the
mould of form”—a character on which he plumed himself not a
little, and, I am sorry to say it, he did not bear his blushing
honors as meekly as could have been hoped for under the
circumstances. He had written back to the friends of his youth
(as Mr. Macawber hath it), in Knoxville,
<pb n="186"/>
that he was growing more reconciled to his fate; his mind
was calmer, he said, though his exile had, at first, gone very hard
with him; but the manners of the natives were evidently, he was
pleased to think, under his missionary labor, improving, and he
must say for these natives, that they had evinced docility—which
gave him hopes of further civilization.</p>
            <p>That there could be any thing beyond the pitch of refinement
to which Knoxville had gone, Paul could not believe on less
than ocular evidence.</p>
            <p>I got out a subpoena and sent the sheriff after Roberts, with
orders for immediate attendance. The court was in session, and I
proposed taking up this matter of Beechim's before the usual
business of the day was gone into.</p>
            <p>Samuel came into the court somewhat discomposed, but on
observing that Beechim was not present, became reassured. His
Honor drew from his pouch a fresh quid of tobacco, deposited it
in his right cheek, wiped his mouth neatly with his handkerchief,
seated himself comfortably in his chair, cleared his throat, blew
his nose, and spread out his countenance into a pleasant and
encouraging “skew,” and directed me to proceed with the
witness—commencing at the beginning and telling the witness to
take his time.</p>
            <p>Roberts took the stand. He testified to this effect: indeed, this
is nearly a literal transcript of my notes, taken at the time
“Witness knows the parties—has known them for three years—
is intimately acquainted with Beechim being a Tennesseean and
having been at one time at Knoxville—
<pb n="187"/>
knows that Beechim and Cousins were on good terms;
indeed quite friendly until May last. In company with witness
they went together to New Orleans; went by way of Jackson and
the Mississippi river; arrived there the 13th of the
month—conversed together a good deal—conversation of a
friendly character—quite sociable; Beechim talked a great deal of
Knoxville, the girls, fashions and society: Cousins listened
attentively: <hi rend="italics">knows</hi> the parties
<hi rend="italics">must</hi> have been friendly. Arrived in
New Orleans on the 18th, about 10 A.M., Monday; intended to
remain until Thursday; no boat going up until Tuesday night. B.
expressed himself gratified by the zeal of the porters and hackmen
to serve him; said, however, that it marred the enjoyment
somewhat to think that probably these attentions might be
mercenary. It was well not to be too credulous. Took lodgings at
the St. Charles Hotel. Heard a conversation going on between the
two—subject, <hi rend="italics">the mode</hi>: Cousins
had been in the city and the
hotel, frequently, so he said—knew the rules and the etiquette;
Beechim had been at the best hotels in Knoxville, knew
<hi rend="italics">their</hi> rules,
but had been from Knoxville a good while,
 <hi rend="italics">therefore</hi> was
rusty—was not certain but that he might make some awkward
blunder—might be fatal to his character: Cousins offered
to act as cicerone—said B. might rely on him, ‘to
put him through;’ told him to take an item from him—Beechim
thanked him kindly. At three the gong rang for dinner—parties
were in the gentlemen's sitting room. B. Started—thought at first
that the steam engine that worked the cooking stove in the
kitchen had burst its boiler. C.
<pb n="188"/>
told him it was the gong: B. asked him if it were not a new
thing—long as he had been in Knoxville had never heard of such a
thing—asked C. if he could believe it. Went to dinner—bill of
fare was handed; B. wished to know if there was any
 <hi rend="italics">lincister</hi> to
translate the French dishes—said there was in Knoxville; got along
pretty well until just as B. had taken a piece of pine-apple on his
plate, the waiter came along and put a green-colored bowl before
every guest's plate with water and a small slice of lemon in it.
Beechim asked Cousins what <hi rend="italics">that</hi>
was. C. replied, ‘Sop for the
pine-apple.’ B. said he thought so. “That's
the way it used to be
served up at ‘The Traveller's Rest’ in
Knoxville.” Beechim took
the bowl and put it in his plate, and then put the
pine-apple in the
bowl, and commenced cutting up the apple, stirred it around in
the fluid with his fork, and ate it, piece after piece. B. kept his
eyes on the bowl—did not observe what was passing about him.
Many persons at table—five hundred at least—ladies, dandies,
foreigners, moustached fellows; began to be an uproar on the other
side of the table; every body got to looking down at
Beechim—eye-glasses put up—a double-barrelled spy-glass (as
witness supposed) levelled at him by a man at the head of the
table, who stood up to draw a bead on him—loud
laughing—women putting handkerchiefs, or napkins, (witness is
not certain which,) to their mouths. B. got through with the
pine-apple. Cousins had been laughing with the rest—composed himself
now, and asked B. “how he liked the pine-apple?” B. answered
in these words: ‘I think the pine-apple very good, but don't
<pb n="189"/>
you think the sauce is rather insipid?’  -
Spoke the words pretty
loud—heard at some distance—great sensation—immoderate
laughter—women screaming—men calling for wine
—the French consul's clerk drank to the English consul's clerk
‘Ze shentleman from ze interiore, may he leeve to a
<hi rend="italics">green</hi> ole
aige,’—drank with all the honors. Beechim
seeing the fuss, turned
to an old man next him and asked what was the matter—any
news of an exciting character? The old man, a cotton broker—an
Englishman—replied that he, B., ‘had been making an ass of
himself—he had been eating out of the finger-bowl.’
B.'s face grew
as red as a beet—then pale; he jumped back—tried to creep out
by bending his head down below the chairs—rushed on and
knocked over the waiter with the coffee—spilt it on a young
lady—staggered back and fell against a Frenchman—tore his
ruffles—knocked him, head striking head, over against an
Irishman—quarrel—two duels next morning—Frenchman killed.
Gen. Sacré Frogleggé rose and proposed three cheers for the
gentleman of <hi rend="italics">retiring</hi> habits; <hi rend="italics">encored</hi>: wine all around the
board—uproarious doings: Tom Placide called on to rehearse the
scene—done—applause terrific: Beechim got out—forgot where
his hat was—ran bare-headed to the bar(?)—called for his
bill—never got his clothes—ran to the steamboat—shut himself
up in the state room for two days;—thing out in the Picayune
next morning—no names given. B. came home—saw Cousins
when <hi rend="italics'">he</hi> came up—licked him within an inch of his life with a
hickory stick. Witness further saith not.”</p>
            <pb n="190"/>
            <p>“Yes” said the judge, “and served him right. Justification
complete! So enter it, clerk.”</p>
            <p>During the delivery of this testimony, you may be sure that
the crowd were not very serious; but knowing how sensitive
Beechim was on the subject, I was congratulating myself that he
was not present. Turning from the witness as he finished, I was
pained to see Beechim—he had come in after the trial
began,—poor Paul! sitting on the bench weeping piteously. I
tried to console him—I told him not to mind it—it was a mere
<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">bagatelle</foreign>
               </hi>; but he only squeezed my hand, and brokenly said, “B.,
thank you; you are my friend: I shall never forget you; you meant
it for the best:—you have saved my body but you have ruined
my character. Goodbye, I leave this morning. Roberts will settle
your fee. But, B., as a friend—one request; if—you—can—
help—it—don't—let—this—thing—get—

February, 1849.</p>
            <p>His Honor made a solemn and affecting charge to the audience,
generally, commending the moderation of young Beechim. “See,”
said his Honor, “the way that this thing works. Most men
would have seized their gun, or bowie,
<pb n="191"/>
on such terrible aggravation, and taken the life of the culprit; but
this young gentleman has set an example which older heads might

taking a club and giving him a good, sound, constitutional,
conservative licking; and you see, gentlemen, the milder remedy
has answered every good purpose! The Court adjourns for

            <head>AN AFFAIR OF HONOR.</head>
            <p>IN the pleasant village of Patton's-Hill, in the <hi rend="italics">Flush Times</hi>, there
were several resorts for the refreshment of the weary traveller,
and for the allaying of the chronic thirst of more than one of the
inhabitants of the place and the country adjacent. They are closed
now, as are the gaping portals of those who were wont in the wild
days, to “indulge” in exciting beverages. A staid, quiet, moral and
intelligent community have supplied the place of many of the
early settlers “who left their country for their country's good;”
and churches, school-houses and Lodges now are prominent
where the “doggery” made wild work with “the peace and
dignity of the State,” and the respectability and decency of
particular individuals.</p>
            <p>In the old times there came into the village of a Saturday
evening, a company more promiscuous than select, who gathered,
like bees at the mouth of a hive, around the doors of the grocery.
On one of these occasions a scene occurred, which I think worthy
of commemoration; and it may be relied upon as authentic, in the
main, as it came regularly before
<pb n="193"/>
the Court as a part of the proceedings of a trial in a State
case.</p>
            <p>Jonas Sykes was a very valiant man when in liquor. But
Jonas, like a good many other valiant men, was more valiant in
peace than in war. He was a very Samson in fight—but, like
Samson, he liked to do battle with that description of weapon
which so scattered the Philistine hosts—<hi rend="italics">that</hi> jaw-bone—one of
which Nature had furnished Jonas with. Jonas was prodigal in the
jaw-work and wind-work of a fight, and he could outswear “our
army in Flanders.” He had method in his madness, too, as he
showed in selecting his enemies. He always knew, or thought he
knew, how much a man would stand before he commenced
“abusing” him, and his wrath grew the fiercer according as the
patience of his enemy grew greater, and he was more fierce—like
a bull-dog chained—as he was the more held off.</p>
            <p>Jonas had picked a quarrel with a quiet, demure fellow of the
name of Samuel Mooney, and lavished upon that gentleman's
liver, soul and eyes, many expressions much more fervid than
polite or kind. Sam stood it for some time, but at length, like a
terrapin with coals on his back, even his sluggish spirit could
stand it no longer. He began to retort on Jonas some of the
inverted compliments with which Jonas had besprinkled him.
Whereupon Jonas felt his chivalry so moved thereat, that he
challenged him to mortal combat.</p>
            <p>Now, Jonas, as most bullies did at that time, went armed.
Samuel had no <hi rend="italics">weepins</hi>, as he called those dangerous implements,
<pb n="194"/>
and gave that fact as an apology for not accepting Jonas's
kind invitation. But Jonas would not “hear to” any such paltry
excuse; he denounced Sam, for a white-livered poltroon, who
would insult a gentleman (thereby meaning himself), and then
refuse him satisfaction, and swore he would post him up all over
town; regretting that he did not have the chance of blowing a hole
through his carcass with his “Derringer” that “a bull-bat could
fly through without tetching airy wing,” and giving him his solemn
word of honor that if he, (Sam,) would only fight him, (Jonas,) he,
(Jonas,) wouldn't hit him, (Sam,) an inch above his
hipbone—which certainly was encouraging.</p>
            <p>Sam still protested he was weaponless. “Well,” said Jonas,
“you shan't have that excuse any longer. I've got two as good
pistols as ever was bought at Or<hi rend="italics">leens</hi>, and you may have choice.”
And pulling one out of either side pocket, he produced two
pistols very much alike, and, advancing to Sam, put his hands
behind him and shuffled them from hand to hand a moment or
two, and then held them forward—one rather in advance of the
other—towards Sam, telling him to take which he chose. Sam took
the one nearest to him, and Jonas called out to Bob Dobbs, who
stood by, “to put them through in a fair duel,” and called the
crowd to witness “that he done it to the rascal accordin' to
law.” Bob willingly accepted the honorable position assigned
him; commanded order; made the crowd stand back;—measured
off the ground—ten paces—and stationed the combatants
sidewise in duelling position. Bob then
<pb n="195"/>
armed himself with a scythe blade, and flourishing it in the air,
swore death and destruction to all who should interfere by word,
look, or sign.</p>
            <p>Bob took his position at a right angle between two, and gave
out in a loud and sonorous voice the programme of proceedings.
“Gentlemen,” said he, “the rules 
are as follows: the parties are to
be asked—‘Gentlemen are you ready’—answering Yes, I, as
mutual second, will then pronounce the words slowly, 
‘Fire:
one—two—three;’ the parties to fire as 
they choose between the
words <hi rend="italics">Fire</hi> and <hi rend="italics">three</hi>, and if either fires before or after the time, I
shall proceed to put him to death without quarter, bail or main
prize.” Micajah F., a lawyer present, suggested, “or benefit of
clergy.” “Yes,” said Bob, “or the benefit of a clergyman.”</p>
            <p>Bob then proceeded to give the words out. At the word <hi rend="italics">two</hi>
Jonas's pistol snapped, but Sam's went off, the ball striking a
button on Jonas's drawers and cutting off a little of the skin.
Jonas fell—his legs flying up in the air, and shouting, “Murder!
Murder! he's knocked off all the lower part of my ab<hi rend="italics">do</hi>men.
Send for a doctor! quick! quick! Oh! Lordy! oh! Lordy! I'm a
dead man: the other fellow got the—wrong—pistol!” (And so he
had; for on examining Jonas's pistol, it was found to have had no
load in it. Jonas, by mistake in shuffling, having given the <hi rend="italics">loaded</hi>
one to Sam and kept the empty one himself.)</p>
            <p>The testimony in the case was related with such comic
humor by one of the witnesses, that the jury were thrown
<pb n="196"/>
into convulsions of laughter; and the case being submitted
without argument, the verdict was a fine of one cent only against
the combatants.</p>
            <p>Jonas immediately retired from the bullying business after
that time, and as soon as he could get his affairs wound up, like “
the star of Empire,” 
“westward took his way.”</p>
         </div>
         <pb n="197"/>
         <div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <head>HON. S.S. PRENTISS.</head>
            <p>THE character of the bar, in the older portions of the State of
Mississippi, was very different from that of the bar in the new
districts. Especially was this the case with the counties on and
near the Mississippi river. In its front ranks stood Prentiss, Holt,
Boyd, Quitman, Wilkinson, Winchester, Foote, Henderson, and
others.</p>
            <p>It was at the period first mentioned by me, in 1837, that
Sargeant S. Prentiss was in the flower of his forensic fame. He had
not, at that time, mingled largely in federal politics. He had made
but few enemies; and had not “staled his presence,” but was in all
the freshness of his unmatched faculties. At this day it is difficult
for any one to appreciate the enthusiasm which greeted this gifted
man, the admiration which was felt for him, and the affection
which followed him. He was to Mississippi, in her youth, what
Jenny Lind is to the musical world, or what Charles Fox, whom
he resembled in many things, was to the whig party of England in
his day. Why he was so, it is not difficult to see. He was a type
of his times, a representative of the qualities of the people, or
<pb n="198"/>
rather of the better qualities of the wilder and more impetuous
part of them. The proportion of young men—as in all new
countries—was great, and the proportion of wild young men was,
unfortunately, still greater.</p>
            <p>He had all those qualities which make us charitable to the
character of Prince Hal, as it is painted by Shakespeare, even when
our approval is not fully bestowed. Generous as a prince of the
royal blood, brave and chivalrous as a knight templar, of a spirit
that scorned every thing mean, underhanded or servile, he was
prodigal to improvidence, instant in resentment, and bitter in his
animosities, yet magnanimous to forgive when reparation had
been made, or misconstruction explained away. There was no
littleness about him. Even towards an avowed enemy he was open
and manly, and bore himself with a sort of antique courtesy and
knightly hostility, in which self-respect mingled with respect for
his foe, except when contempt was mixed with hatred; then no
words can convey any sense of the intensity of his scorn, the
depth of his loathing. When he thus outlawed a man from his
courtesy and respect, language could scarce supply words to
express his disgust and detestation.</p>
            <p>Fear seemed to be a stranger to his nature. He never hesitated
to meet, nor did he wait for, “responsibility,” but he went in
quest of it. To denounce meanness or villainy, in any and all
forms, when it came in his way, was, with him, a matter of duty,
from which he never shrunk; and so to denounce it as to bring
himself in direct collision with the perpetrator or
perpetrators—for he took them in
<pb n="199"/>
crowds as well as singly—was a task for which he was instant in
season or out of season.</p>
            <p>Even in the vices of Prentiss, there were magnificence and
brilliancy imposing in a high degree. When he treated, it was a
mass entertaimnent. On one occasion he chartered the theatre for
the special gratification of his friends,—the public generally. He
bet thousands on the turn of a card, and witnessed the success or
failure of the wager with the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</foreign>
               </hi> of a Mexican monte-player,
or, as was most usual, with the light humor of a Spanish
muleteer. He broke a faro-bank by the nerve with which he laid
his large bets, and by exciting the passion of the veteran dealer, or
awed him into honesty by the glance of his strong and steady eye.</p>
            <p>Attachment to his friends was a passion. It was a part of the
loyalty to the honorable and chivalric, which formed the sub-soil
of his strange and wayward nature. He never deserted a friend.
His confidence knew no bounds. It scorned all restraints and
considerations of prudence or policy. He made his friends'
quarrels his own, and was as guardful of their reputations as of his
own. He would put his name on the back of their paper, without
looking at the face of it, and give his <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</foreign>
               </hi>, if needed, by
the quire. He was above the littleness of jealousy or rivalry; and
his love of truth, his fidelity and frankness, were formed on the
antique models of the chevaliers. But in social qualities he knew
no rival. These made him the delight of every circle; they were
adapted to all, and were exercised on all. The same
<pb n="200"/>
histrionic and dramatic talent that gave to his oratory so
irresistible a charm, and adapted him to all grades and sorts of
people, fitted him, in conversation, to delight all men. He never
staled and never flagged. Even if the fund of acquired capital could
have run out, his originality was such, that his supply from the
perennial fountain within was inexhaustible.</p>
            <p>His humor was as various as profound—from the most
delicate wit to the broadest farce, from irony to caricature, from
classical allusion to the verge—and sometimes beyond the
verge—of coarse jest and Falstaff extravagance; and no one knew
in which department he most excelled. His animal spirits flowed
over like an artesian well, ever gushing out in a deep, bright, and
sparkling current.</p>
            <p>He never seemed to despond or droop for a moment: the cares
and anxieties of life were mere bagatelles to him. Sent to jail for
fighting in the court-house, he made the walls of the prison
resound with unaccustomed shouts of merriment and revelry.
Starting to fight a duel, he laid down his hand at poker, to resume
it with a smile when he returned, and went on the field laughing
with his friends, as to a pic-nic. Yet no one knew better the
proprieties of life than himself—when to put off levity, and treat
grave subjects and persons with proper respect; and no one could
assume and preserve more gracefully a dignified and sober
demeanor.</p>
            <p>His early reading and education had been extensive and deep.
Probably no man of his age, in the State, was so well read in the
ancient and modern classics, in the current
<pb n="201"/>
literature of the day, and—what may seem stranger—in the
sacred scriptures. His speeches drew some of their grandest
images, strongest expressions, and aptest illustrations from the
inspired writings.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of this remarkable man was well calculated to
rivet the interest his character inspired. Though he was low of
stature, and deformed in one leg, his frame was uncommonly
athletic and muscular; his arms and chest were well formed, the
latter deep and broad; his head large, and a model of classical
proportions and noble contour. A handsome face, compact brow,
massive and expanded, and eyes of dark hazel, full and clear, were
fitted for the expression of every passion and flitting shade of
feeling and sentiment. His complexion partook of the bilious
rather than the sanguine temperament. The skin was smooth and
bloodless—no excitement or stimulus heightened its color; nor did
the writer ever see any evidence in his face of irregularity of habit.
In repose, his countenance was serious and rather melancholy—
certainly somewhat soft and quiet in expression, but evidencing
strength and power, and the masculine rather than the light and
flexible qualities which characterized him in his convivial
moments. There was nothing affected or theatrical in his manner,
though some parts of his printed speeches would seem to indicate
this. He was frank and artless as a child; and nothing could have
been more winning than his familiar intercourse with the bar,
with whom he was always a favorite, and without a rival in their
affection.</p>
            <p>I come now to speak of him as a lawyer.</p>
            <pb n="202"/>
            <p>He was more widely known as a politician than a lawyer, as
an advocate than a jurist. This was because politics form a wider
and more conspicuous theatre than the bar, and because the mass
of men are better judges of oratory than of law. That he was a man
of wonderful versatility and varied accomplishments, is most true;
that he was a popular orator of the first class is also true; and that
all of his faculties did not often, if ever, find employment in his
profession, may be true likewise. So far he appeared to better
advantage in a deliberative assembly, or before the people,
because there he had a wider range and subjects of a more general
interest, and was not fettered by rules and precedents; his genius
expanded over a larger area, and exercised his powers in greater
variety and number. Moreover, a stump speech is rarely made
chiefly for conviction and persuasion, but to gratify and delight
the auditors, and to raise the character of the speaker. Imagery,
anecdote, ornament, eloquence and elocution, are in better taste
than in a speech at the bar, where the chief and only legitimate aim
is to convince and instruct.</p>
            <p>It will always be a mooted point among Prentiss's admirers,
as to where his strength chiefly lay. My own opinion is that it
was as a jurist that he mostly excelled; that it consisted in
<hi rend="italics">knowing and being able to show to others what was the law</hi>. I state
the opinion with some diffidence, and, did it rest on my own
judgment alone, should not hazard it at all. But the eminent
chief-justice of the high court of errors and appeals of
Mississippi thought that
<pb n="203"/>
Prentiss appeared to most advantage before that court; and a
distinguished judge of the Supreme Court of Alabama, who had
heard him before the chancellor of Mississippi, expressed to me
the opinion that his talents shone most conspicuously in that
forum. These were men who could be led from a fair judgment of
a legal argument by mere oratory, about as readily as old Playfair
could be turned from a true criticism upon a mathematical
treatise, by its being burnished over with extracts from fourth-of-July
harangues. Had brilliant declamation been his only or chief
faculty, there were plenty of his competitors at the bar, who, by
their learning and powers of argument, would have knocked the
spangles off him, and sent his cases whirling out of court, to the
astonishment of hapless clients who had trusted to such fragile
help in time of<hi rend="italics">trial</hi>.</p>
            <p>It may be asked how is this possible? How is it consistent
with the jealous demands which the law makes of the ceaseless
and persevering attention of her followers as the condition of her
favors? The question needs an answer. It is to be found
somewhere else than in the unaided resources of even such an
intellect as that of Sergeant Prentiss. In some form or other,
Prentiss <hi rend="italics">always was</hi> a student. Probably the most largely
developed of all his faculties was his memory. He gathered
information with marvellous rapidity. The sun-stroke that makes
its impression upon the medicated plate is not more rapid in
transcribing, or more faithful in fixing its image, than was
his perception in taking cognizance of facts and principles, or
<pb n="204"/>
his ability to retain them. Once fixed, the impression was there for
ever. It is true, as Mr. Wirt observed, that genius must have
materials to work on. No man, how magnificently soever
endowed, can possibly be a safe, much less a great lawyer, who
does not understand the facts and law of his case. But some men
may understand them much more readily than others. There are
labor-saving minds, as well as labor-saving machines, and that of
Mr. Prentiss was one of them. In youth he had devoted himself
with intense application to legal studies, and had mastered, as few
men have done, the elements of the law and much of its textbook
learning. So acute and retentive an observer must too—especially
in the freshness and novelty of his first years of practice—“have
absorbed” no little law as it floated through the court-house, or
was distilled from the bench and bar.</p>
            <p>But more especially, it should be noted that Mr. Prentiss,
until the fruition of his fame, was a laborious man, even in the
tapestring sense. While the world was spreading the wild tales of
his youth, his deviations, though conspicuous enough while
they lasted, were only occasional, and at long intervals, the
intervening time being occupied in abstemious application to his
studies. Doubtless, too, the supposed obstacles in the way of his
success were greatly exaggerated, the vulgar having a great
proneness to magnify the frailties of great men, and to lionize
genius by making it independent, for its splendid
achievements, of all external aids.</p>
            <pb n="205"/>
            <p>With these allowances however, truth requires the admission
that Mr. Prentiss did, when at the seat of government, occupy the
hours, usually allotted by the diligent practitioner to books or
clients, in amusements not well suited to prepare him for those
great efforts which have indissolubly associated his name with the
judicial history of the State.</p>
            <p>As an advocate, Mr. Prentiss attained a wider celebrity than
as a jurist. Indeed, he was more formidable in this than in any
other department of his profession. Before the Supreme, or
Chancery, or Circuit Court, upon the law of the case, inferior
abilities might set off, against greater native powers, superior
application and research; or the precedents might overpower him;
or the learning or judgment of the bench might come in aid of the
right, even when more feebly defended than assailed. But what
protection had mediocrity, or even second-rate talent, against the
influences of excitement and fascination, let loose upon a mercurial
jury, at least as easily impressed through their passions as their
reason? The boldness of his attacks, his iron nerve, his adroitness,
his power of debate, the overpowering fire—broadside after
broadside—which he poured into the assailable points of his
adversary, his facility and plainness of illustration, and his talent
of adapting himself to every mind and character he addressed,
rendered him, on all debatable issues, next to irresistible. To give
him the conclusion was nearly the same thing as to give him the
verdict.</p>
            <p>In the examination of witnesses, he was thought particularly
<pb n="206"/>
to excel. He wasted no time by irrelevant questions. He
seemed to weigh every question before he put it, and see clearly
its bearing upon every part of the case. The facts were brought out
in natural and simple order. He examined as few witnesses, and
elicited as few facts as he could safely get along with. In this way
he avoided the danger of discrepancy, and kept his mind
undiverted from the controlling points in the case. The jury were
left unwearied and unconfused, and saw, before the argument, the
bearing of the testimony.</p>
            <p>He avoided, too, the miserable error into which so many
lawyers fall, of making every possible point in a case, and
pressing all with equal force and confidence, thereby prejudicing
the mind of the court, and making the jury believe that the trial of
a cause is but running a jockey race.</p>
            <p>In arguing a cause of much public interest, he got all the benefit
of the sympathy and feeling of the by-standers. He would
sometimes turn towards them in an impassioned appeal, as if
looking for a larger audience than court and jury; and the
excitement of the outsiders, especially in criminal cases, was
thrown with great effect into the jury-box.</p>
            <p>Mr. Prentiss was never thrown off his guard, or seemingly
taken by surprise. He kept his temper: or, if he got furious,
there was “method in his madness.”</p>
            <p>He had a faculty in speaking I never knew possesed by any
other person. He seemed to speak without any effort
<pb n="207"/>
of the will. There seemed to be no governing or guiding power to
the particular faculty called into exercise. It worked on, and its
treasures flowed spontaneously. There was no air of thought, no
elevation, frowning or knitting of the brow—no fixing up of the
countenance—no pauses to collect or arrange his thoughts. All
seemed natural and unpremeditated. No one ever felt uneasy lest
he might fall; in his most brilliant flights “the empyrean heights”
into which he soared seemed to be his natural element—as the
upper air the eagle's.</p>
            <p>Among the most powerful of his jury efforts, were his
speeches against Bird, for the murder of Cameron; and against
Phelps, the notorious highway robber and murderer. Both were
convicted. The former owed his conviction, as General Foote, who
defended him with great zeal and ability, thought, to the
transcendent eloquence of Prentiss. He was justly convicted,
however, as his confession, afterwards made, proved. Phelps was
one of the most daring and desperate of ruffians. He fronted his
prosecutor and the court, not only with composure, but with
scornful and malignant defiance. When Prentiss rose to speak, and
for some time afterwards, the criminal scowled upon him a look of
hate and insolence. But when the orator, kindling with his subject,
turned upon him, and poured down a stream of burning invective,
like lava, upon his head; when he depicted the villainy and barbarity
of his bloody atrocities; when he pictured, in dark and dismal
colors, the fate which awaited him, and the awful judgment, to be
pronounced at another
<pb n="208"/>
bar, upon his crimes, when he should be confronted with his
innocent victims: when he fixed his gaze of concentrated power
upon him, the strong man's face relaxed; his eyed faltered and fell;
until at length, unable to bear up longer, self-convicted, he hid his
head beneath the bar, and exhibited a picture of ruffian-audacity
cowed beneath the spell of true courage and triumphant genius.
Though convicted, he was not hung. He broke jail, and resisted
recapture so desperately, that although he was encumbered with
his fetters, his pursuers had to kill him in self-defence, or permit
his escape.</p>
            <p>In his defence of criminals, in that large class of cases in which
something of elevation or bravery in some sort, redeemed the
lawlessness of the act, where murder was committed under a
sense of outrage, or upon sudden resentment, and in fair combat,
his chivalrous spirit upheld the the public sentiment, which, if it
did not justify that sort of “wild justice,” could not be brought to
punish it ignominiously. His appeals fell like flames on those</p>
            <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
               <l part="N">“Souls made of fire, and children of the sun,</l>
               <l part="N">With whom revenge was virtue.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I have never heard of but one client of his who was convicted
on a charge of homicide, and he was convicted of one of its lesser
degrees. So successful was he, that the expression—“Prentiss
couldn't clear him”—was a hyperbole that expressed the
desperation of a criminal's fortunes.</p>
            <p>Mr. P. was employed only in important cases, and generally
<pb n="209"/>
as associate counsel, and was thereby relieved of much of
the preliminary preparation which occupies so much of the time
of the attorney in getting a case ripe for trial. In the Supreme and
Chancery Courts he had, of course, only to examine the record
and prepare his argument. On the circuit his labors were much
more arduous. The important criminal and civil causes which he
argued, necessarily required consultations with clients, the
preparation of pleadings and proofs, either under his supervision,
or by his advice and direction; and this, from the number and
difficulty of the cases, must have consumed time and required
application and industry.</p>
            <p>At the time of which I speak, his long vigils and continued
excitement did not enfeeble his energies. Indeed, he has been
known to assert, that he felt brighter, and in better preparation for
forensic debate, after sitting up all night in company with his
friends than at any other time. He required less sleep, probably,
than any man in the State, seldom devoting to that purpose more
than three or four hours in the twenty-four. After his friends had
retired at a late hour in the night, or rather at an early hour in the
morning, he has been known to get his books and papers and
prepare for the business of the day.</p>
            <p>His faculty of concentration drew his energies, as through a
lens, upon the subject before him. No matter what he was
engaged in, his intellect was in ceaseless play and motion. Alike
comprehensive and systematic in the arrangement of his
thoughts, he reproduced without difficulty what he had once
conceived.</p>
            <pb n="210"/>
            <p>Probably something would have still been wanting to explain
his celerity of preparation for his causes, had not partial nature
gifted him with the lawyer's highest talent, the <hi rend="italics">acumen</hi> which, like
an instinct, enabled him to see the points which the record
presented. His genius for generalizing saved him, in a moment, the
labor of a long and tedious reflection upon, and collation of, the
several parts of a narrative. He read with great rapidity; glancing
his eyes through a page he caught the substance of its contents at
a view. His analysis, too, was wonderful. The chemist does not
reduce the contents of his alembic to their elements more rapidly
or surely than he resolved the most complicated facts into
primary principles.</p>
            <p>His statements—like those of all great lawyers—were clear,
perspicuous and compact; the language simple and sententious.
Considered in the most technical sense, as forensic arguments
merely, no one will deny that his speeches were admirable and
able efforts. If the professional reader will turn to the meagre
reports of his arguments in the cases of <hi rend="italics">Ross</hi> v. <hi rend="italics">Vertner</hi>, 5 How.
305; <hi rend="italics">Vick et al</hi>. v. <hi rend="italics">The Mayor and Aldermen of Vicksburg</hi>, 1 How.
381; and <hi rend="italics">The Planters' Bank</hi> v. <hi rend="italics">Snodgrass et al</hi>, he will, I think,
concur in this opinion.</p>
            <p>Anecdotes are not wanting to show that even in the Supreme
Court he argued some cases of great importance, without
knowing any thing about them till the argument was commenced.
One of these savors of the ludicrous. Mr. Prentiss was retained,
as associate counsel, with Mr. (now Gen.) M-,
<pb n="211"/>
at that time one of the most promising as now one of the most
distinguished, lawyers in the State. During the session of the
Supreme Court, at which the case was to come on, Mr. M- called
Mr. P.'s attention to the case, and proposed examining the record
together; but for some reason this was deferred for some time. At
last it was agreed to examine into the case the night before the day
set for the hearing. At the appointed time, Prentiss could not be
found. Mr. M- was in great perplexity. The case was of great
importance; there were able opposing counsel, and his client and
himself had trusted greatly to Mr. P.'s assistance. Prentiss
appeared in the courtroom when the case was called up. The
junior counsel opened the case, reading slowly from the record all
that was necessary to give a clear perception of its merits; and
made the points, and read the authorities he had collected. The
counsel on the other side replied. Mr. P. rose to rejoin. The junior
could scarcely conceal his apprehensions. But there was no cloud
on the brow of the speaker; the consciousness of his power and of
approaching victory sat on his face. He commenced, as he always
did, by stating clearly the case, and the questions raised by the
facts. He proceeded to establish the propositions he contended
for, by their reason, by authorities, and collateral analogies, and to
illustrate them from his copious resources of comparison. He took
up, one by one, the arguments on the other side, and showed their
fallacy; he examined the authorities relied upon in the order in
which they were introduced, and showed their inapplicability, and
the distinction between the facts of the
<pb n="212"/>
cases reported and those in the case at bar; then returning to the
authorities of his colleague, he showed how clearly, in
application and principle, they supported his own argument.
When he had sat down, his colleague declared that Prentiss had
taught him more of the case than he had gathered from his own
researches and reflection.</p>
            <p>Mr. Prentiss had scarcely passed a decade from his majority
when he was the idol of Mississippi. While absent from the state
his name was brought before the people for Congress; the State
then voting by general ticket, and electing two members. He was
elected, the sitting members declining to present themselves
before the people, upon the claim, that they were elected at the
special election, ordered by Governor Lynch, for two years, and
not for the called session merely. Mr. Prentiss, with Mr. Word,
his colleague went on to Washington to claim his seat. He was
admitted to the bar of the House to defend and assert his right. He
delivered then that speech which took the House and the country
by storm; an effort which if his fame rested upon it alone, for its
manliness of tone, exquisite satire, gorgeous imagery, and
argumentative power, would have rendered his name
imperishable. The House, opposed to him as it was in political
sentiment, reversed its former judgment, which declared Gholson
and Claiborne entitled to their seats, and divided equally on the
question of admitting Prentiss and Word. The speaker, however,
gave the casting vote against the latter, and the election was
referred back to the people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Prentiss addressed a circular to the voters of Mississippi,
<pb n="213"/>
in which he announced his intention to canvass the State.
The applause which greeted him at Washington, and which
attended the speeches he was called on to make at the North, came
thundering back to his adopted State. His friends—and their name
was legion—thought before that his talents were of the highest
order; and when their judgments were thus confirmed—when they
received the indorsement of such men as Clay, Webster, and
Calhoun, they felt a kind of personal interest in him: he was <hi rend="italics">their</hi>
Prentiss. They had first discovered him—first brought him
out—first proclaimed his greatness. Their excitement knew no
bounds. Political considerations, too, doubtless had their weight.
The canvass opened—it was less a canvass than an ovation. He
went through the State—an herculean task—making speeches
every day, except Sundays, in the sultry months of summer and
fall. The people of all classes and both sexes turned out to hear
him. He came, as he declared, less on his own errand than theirs,
to vindicate a violated constitution, to rebuke the insult to the
honor and sovereignty of the State, to uphold the sacred right of
the people to elect their own rulers. The theme was worthy of the
orator, the orator of the subject.</p>
            <p>This period may be considered the golden prime of the genius of
Prentiss. His real effective greatness here attained its culminating
point. He had the whole State for his audience, the honor of the
State for his subject. He came well armed and well equipped for
the warfare. Not content with challenging his competitors to
the field, he threw down the
<pb n="214"/>
gauntlet to all comers. Party, or ambition, or some other motive,
constrained several gentlemen—famous before, notorious
afterwards—to meet him. In every instance of such temerity, the
opposer was made to bite the dust.</p>
            <p>The ladies surrounded the rostrum with their carriages, and
added, by their beauty, interest to the scene. There was no element
of oratory that his genius did not supply. It was plain to see
whence his boyhood had drawn its romantic inspiration. His
imagination was colored and imbued with the light of the
shadowy past, and was richly stored with the unreal but life-like
creations, which the genius of Shakespeare and Scott had evoked
from the ideal world. He had lingered, spell-bound, among the
scenes of mediaeval chivalry. His spirit had dwelt, until almost
naturalized, in the mystic dream-land they peopled—among
paladins, and crusaders, and knights-templars; with Monmouth
and Percy—with Bois-Gilbert and Ivanhoe, and the bold
McGregor—with the cavaliers of Rupert, and the iron enthusiasts
of Fairfax. As Judge Bullard remarks of him, he had the talent of an
Italian <foreign xml:lang="la">improvisatore</foreign>, and could speak the thoughts of poetry with
the inspiration of oratory, and in the tones of music. The fluency
of his speech was unbroken—no syllable unpronounced—not a
ripple on the smooth and brilliant tide. Probably he never hesitated
for a word in his life: His diction adapted itself, without effort, to
the thought; now easy and familiar, now stately and dignified, now
beautiful and various as the hues of the rainbow, again compact,
even rugged in sinewy strength, or lofty and grand in eloquent
declamation.</p>
            <pb n="215"/>
            <p>His face and manner were alike uncommon. The turn of the
head was like Byron's; the face and the action were just what the
mind made them. The excitement of the features, the motions of
the head and body, the gesticulation he used, were all in absolute
harmony with the words you heard. You saw and took cognizance
of the general effect only; the particular instrumentalities did not
strike you; they certainly did not call off attention to themselves.
How a countenance so redolent of good humor as his at times,
could so soon be overcast, and express such intense bitterness,
seemed a marvel. But bitterness and the angry passions were,
probably, as strongly implanted in him as any other sentiments or
qualities.</p>
            <p>There was much about him to remind you of Byron: the cast
of head—the classic features—the fiery and restive nature—
the moral and personal daring—the imaginative and poetical
temperament—the scorn and deep passion—the deformity of
which I have spoken—the satiric wit—the craving for excitement,
and the air of melancholy he sometimes wore—his early neglect,
and the imagined slights put upon him in his unfriended
youth—the collisions, mental and physical, which he had with
others—his brilliant and sudden reputation, and the romantic
interest which invested him, make up a list of correspondencies,
still further increased, alas! by his untimely death.</p>
            <p>With such abilities as we have alluded to, and surrounded by
such circumstances, he prosecuted the canvass, making himself
the equal favorite of all classes. Old democrats were,
<pb n="216"/>
seen, with tears running down their cheeks, laughing hysterically;
and some, who, ever since the formation of parties, had voted the
democratic ticket, from coroner up to governor, threw up their
hats and shouted for him. He was returned to Congress by a large
majority, leading his colleague, who ran on precisely the same
question, more than a thousand votes.</p>
            <p>The political career of Mr. Prentiss after this time is matter of
public history, and I do not propose to refer to it.</p>
            <p>After his return from Congress, Mr. Prentiss continued to
devote himself to his profession; but, subsequently to 1841 or
1842, he was more engaged in closing up his old business than in
prosecuting new. Some year or two afterwards, the suit which
involved his fortune was determined against him in the Supreme
Court of the United States; and he found himself by this event,
aggravated as it was by his immense liabilities for others, deprived
of the accumulations of years of successful practice, and again
dependent upon his own exertions for the support of himself and
others now placed under his protection. In the mean time, the
profession in Mississippi had become less remunerative, and more
laborious. Bearing up with an unbroken spirit against adverse
fortune, he determined to try a new theatre, where his talents
might have larger scope. For this purpose, he removed to the city
of New Orleans, and was admitted to the bar there. How rapidly
he rose to a position among the leaders of that eminent bar, and
how near he seemed to be to its first honors, the country knows.
The energy with which he
<pb n="217"/>
addressed himself to the task of mastering the peculiar
jurisprudence of Louisiana, and the success with which his efforts
were crowned, are not the least of the splendid achievements of
this distinguished gentleman.</p>
            <p>The danger is not that we shall be misconstrued in regard to
the rude sketch we have given of Mr. Prentiss in any such manner
as to leave the impression that we are prejudiced against, or have
underrated the character of, that gentleman. We are conscious of
having written in no unkind or unloving spirit of one whom, in
life, we honored, and whose memory is still dear to us; the danger
is elsewhere. It is twofold: that we may be supposed to have
assigned to Prentiss a higher order of abilities than he possessed;
and, in the second place, that we have presented, for
undistinguishing admiration, a character, some of the elements of
which do not deserve to be admired or imitated—and indeed,
which are of most perilous example, especially to warm-blooded
youth. As to the first objection, we feel sure that we are not
mistaken, and even did we distrust our own judgment we would
be confirmed by Sharkey, Boyd, Wilkinson, Guion, Quitman, to
say nothing of the commendations of Clay, Webster, and
Calhoun, “the immortal three,” whose opinions as to Prentiss's
talents would be considered extravagant if they did not carry with
them the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">imprimatur</foreign>
               </hi> of their own great names. But we confess to
the danger implied in the second suggestion. With all our
admiration for Prentiss—much as his memory is endeared to
us—however the faults of his character and the
irregularities of his life may be palliated by the
<pb n="218"/>
peculiar circumstances which pressed upon idiosyncrasies of
temper and mind almost as peculiar as those circumstances,—it
cannot be denied, and it ought not to be concealed, that the
influence of Prentiss upon the men, especially upon the young
men of this time and association, was hurtful. True, he had some
attributes worthy of unlimited admiration, and he did some things
which the best men might take as examples for imitation. He was a
noble, whole-soured, magnanimous man: as pure of honor, as lofty
in chivalric bearing as the heroes of romance: but, mixed with these
brilliant qualities, were vices of mind and habit, which made them
more dangerous than if they had not existed at all: for vice is more
easily copied than virtue: and in the partnership between virtue
and vice, vice subsidizes virtue to its uses. Prentiss lacked regular,
self-denying, systematic application. He accomplished a great
deal, but not a great deal for his capital: if he did more than most
men, he did less than the task of such a man: if he gathered much,
he wasted and scattered more. He wanted the great essential
element of a true, genuine, moral greatness: there was not—above
his intellect and the bright army of glittering faculties and strong
powers of his mind—above the fierce host of passions in his
soul—a <hi rend="italics">presiding spirit of Duty</hi>. Life was no trust to him: it was a
thing to be enjoyed—a bright holiday season—a gala day, to be
spent freely and carelessly—a gift to be decked out with
brilliant deeds and eloquent words and all gewgaws of
fancy—and to be laid down bravely when the evening star
should succeed—the bright sun and the dews begin to fall
<pb n="219"/>
softly upon the green earth. True, he labored more than most
men: but he labored as he frolicked—because his mind could not
be idle, but burst into work as by the irrepressible instinct which
sought occupation as an outlet to intellectual excitement: but what
he accomplished was nothing to the measure of his powers. He
studied more than he seemed to study,—more, probably, than he
cared to have it believed he studied. But he could accomplish with
only slender effort, the end for which less gifted men must delve,
and toil, and slave. But the imitators, the many youths of warm
passions and high hopes, ambitious of distinction—yet solicitous
of pleasure—blinded by the glare of Prentiss's eloquence, the
corruscations of a wit and fancy through which his speeches were
borne as a stately ship through the phosphorescent waves of a
tropical sea—what example was it to <hi rend="italics">them</hi> to see the renown of
the Forum, the eloquence of the Hustings, the triumphs of the
Senate associated with the faro-table, the midnight revel, the
drunken carouse, the loose talk of the board laden with wine and
cards? What Prentiss effected they failed in compassing. Like a
chamois hunter full of life, and vigor, and courage, supported by
the spear of his genius—potent as Ithuriel's—Prentiss sprang up
the steeps and leaped over the chasms on his way to the mount
where the “proud temple” shines above cloud and storm; but
mediocrity, in assaying to follow him, but made ridiculous the
enterprise which only such a man with such aids could
accomplish. And even he, not wisely or well: the penalty came at
last, as it must ever come for a violation of
<pb n="220"/>
natural and moral laws. He lived in pain and poverty drooping in
spirit, exhausted in mind and body, to lament that wasting of life,
and health, and genius, which, unwasted, in the heyday of
existence, and in the meridian lustre of his unrivalled powers,
might have opened for himself and for his country a career of
usefulness and just renown scarcely paralleled by the most
honored and loved of all the land.</p>
            <p>If to squander thus such rare gifts were a grievous fault,
grievously hath this erring child of genius answered it. But
painfully making this concession, forced alone by the truth, it is
with pleasure we can say, that, with this deduction from
Prentiss's claims to reverence and honor, there yet remains so
much of force and of brilliancy in the character—so much that is
honorable, and noble, and generous—so much of a manhood
whose robust and masculine virtues are set off by the wild and
lovely graces that attempered and adorned its strength, that we
feel drawn to it not less to admire than to love.</p>
            <p>In the midst of his budding prospects, rapidly ripening into
fruition, insidious disease assailed him. It was long hoped that the
close and fibrous system, which had, seemingly, defied all the
laws of nature, would prove superior to this malady. His
unconquerable will bore him up long against its attacks. Indeed it
seemed that only death itself could subdue that fiery and
unextinguishable energy. He made his last great effort, breathing in
its feeble accents but a more touching and affecting pathos, and a
more persuasive eloquence, in behalf of Lopez, charged with the
offence of
<pb n="221"/>
fitting out an expedition against Cuba. So weak was he, that he
was compelled to deliver it in a sitting posture, and was carried,
after its delivery, exhausted from the bar.</p>
            <p>Not long after this time, in a state of complete prostration, he
was taken, in a steamboat, from New-Orleans to Natchez, under
the care of some faithful friends. The opiates given him, and the
exhaustion of nature, had dethroned his imperial reason; and the
great advocate talked wildly of some trial in which he supposed
he was engaged. When he reached Natchez, he was taken to the
residence of a relation, and from that time, only for a moment, did
a glance of recognition fall—lighting up for an instant his pallid
features—upon his wife and children, weeping around his bed.
On the morning of —died this remarkable man, in the 42d year of
his age. What he <hi rend="italics">was</hi>, we know. What he
<hi rend="italics">might have been</hi>, after a mature age and a riper wisdom, we
cannot tell. But that he was capable of commanding the loftiest
heights of fame, and marking his name and character upon the age
he lived in, we verily believe.</p>
            <p>But he has gone. He died, and lies buried near that noble river
which first, when he was a raw Yankee boy, caught his poetic
eye, and stirred, by its aspect of grandeur, his sublime
imagination: upon whose shores first fell his burning and
impassioned words as they aroused the rapturous applause of his
astonished auditors. And long will that noble river flow out its
tide into the gulf, ere the roar of its current shall mingle with the
tones of such eloquence again—eloquence, as full and majestic,
as resistless and sublime,
<pb n="222"/>
and as wild in its sweep as its own sea-like flood,</p>

we all heard them, as the toll of the bell for a brother's funeral.
The chivalrous felt, when they heard that “young Harry Percy's
spur was cold,” that the world had somehow grown
commonplace; and the men of wit and genius, or those who could
appreciate such qualities in others, looking over the surviving bar,

            <p>THE citizens of an old country are very prone to consider the
people of a newly settled State or Territory as greatly their
inferiors: just as old men are apt to consider those younger than
themselves, and who have grown up under their observation, as <hi rend="italics">their</hi>
inferiors. It is a very natural sentiment. It is flattering to pride, and it
tickles the vanity of senility—individual and State—to assign this
status of elevation to self, and this consequent depression to others.
Accordingly, the Englishman looks upon the American as rather a
green-horn, gawky sort of a fellow, infinitely below the standard of
John Bull in every thing, external and internal, of character and of
circumstance; and no amount of licking can thrash the idea out of
him. As Swedenborg says of some religious dogmas held by certain
bigots—it is glued to his brains. So it is with our own people. The
Bostonian looks down upon the Virginian—the Virginian on the
Tennesseeian—the Tennesseeian on the Alabamian—the Alabamian
on the Mississippian—the Mississippian on the Louisianian—the
Louisianian on the Texian—the Texian on

New Mexico, and, we suppose, New Mexico on Pandemonium.</p>
            <p>It may be one of the perversions of patriotism, to create and
foster invidious and partial discriminations between different
countries, and between different sections of the same country: and
especially does this prejudice exist and deepen with a people
stationary and secluded in habit and position. But travel, a
broader range of inquiry and observation, more intimate
associations and a freer correspondence, begetting larger and more
cosmopolitan views of men and things, serve greatly to soften
these prejudices, even where they are not entirely removed. That
there is <hi rend="italics">some</hi> good country even beyond the Chinese wall, and
that all not within that barrier are not quite “outside barbarians,”
the Celestials themselves are beginning to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>There is no greater error than that which assigns inferiority
to the bar of the South-West, in comparison with that of any
other section of the same extent in the United States. Indeed, it is
our honest conviction that the profession in the States of
Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, are not equalled,
as a whole, by the same number of lawyers in any other quarter
of the Union,—certainly in no other quarter where commerce is
no more various and largely pursued.</p>
            <p>The reasons for this opinion we proceed to give. The most
conclusive mode of establishing this proposition would probably
be by comparison; but this, from the nature of the case, is
impossible. The knowledge of facts and men is
<pb n="225"/>
wanting, and even if possessed by any capable of instituting the
comparison, the decision would, at last, be only an opinion, and
would carry but little weight, even if the cape city and fairness of
the critic were duly authenticated to the reader.</p>
            <p>It is a remarkable fact, that the great men of every State in the
Union, were those men who figured about the time of the
organization and the settling down of their several judicial systems
into definite shape and character. Not taking into the account the
Revolutionary era—unquestionably the most brilliant intellectual
period of our history—let us look to that period which succeeded
the turmoil, embarrassment and confusion of the Revolution, and
of the times of civil agitation and contention next following, and
out of which arose our present constitution. The first thing our
fathers did was to get a country; then to fix on it the character of
government it was to have; then to make laws to carry it on and
achieve its objects. The men, as a class, who did all this, were
lawyers: their labors in founding and starting into motion our
constitutions and laws were great and praiseworthy: but after
setting the government agoing, there was much more to do; and
this was to give the right direction and impress to its
jurisprudence. The Statutes of free country are usually but a small
part of the body of its law—and the common law of England, itself but
a judicial enlargement and adaptation of certain vague and rude principles
of jurisprudence to new wants, new necessities and exigencies,
was a light rather than a guide, to the judges of
<pb n="226"/>
our new systems, called to administer justice under new and
widely different conditions and circumstances. The greatest talent
was necessary for these new duties. It required the nicest
discrimination and the soundest judgment to determine what parts
of the British system were opposed to the genius of the new
constitution, and what parts were inapplicable by reason of new
relations or differing circumstances. The great judicial era of the
United States—equally great in bar and bench—was the first
quarter of this century. And it is a singular coincidence that this
was the case in nearly every, if not in every, State. Those were the
days of Marshall and Story and Parsons, of Kent and Thompson
and Roane, of Smith and Wythe and Jay, and many other fixed
planets of the judicial system, while the whole horizon, in every
part of the extended cycle, was lit up by stars worthy to revolve
around and add light to such luminaries. Mr. Webster declared that
the ablest competition he had met with, in his long professional
career, was that he encountered at the rude provincial bar of back-woods
New Hampshire in his earlier practice.</p>
            <p>And this same remarkable preëminence has characterized the
bar of every new State when, or shortly after emerging from, its
territorial condition and first crude organization; the States of
Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana
forcibly illustrate this truth, and we have no question but that
Texas and California are affording new expositions of its
correctness.</p>
            <p>A fact so uniform in its existence, must have some solid
<pb n="227"/>
principle for its cause. This principle we shall seek to ascertain. It
is the same influence, in a modified form, which partly discovers
and partly creates great men in times of revolution. Men are fit for
more and higher uses than they are commonly put to. The idea that
genius is self-conscious of its powers, and that men naturally fall
into the position for which they are fitted, we regard as by no
means an universal truth, if any truth at all. Who believes that
Washington ever dreamed of his capacity for the great mission he
so nobly accomplished, before with fear and trembling, he started
out on its fulfillment? Probably the very ordeal through which he
passed to greatness purified and qualified him for the self-denial
and self-conquest, the patience and the fortitude, which made its
crowning glory. To be great, there must be a great work to be done.
Talents alone are not distinction. For the Archimedean work, there
must be a fulcrum as well as a lever. Great abilities usually need a
great stimulus. What dormant genius there is in every country, may
be known by the daily examples of a success, of which there was
neither early promise nor early expectation.</p>
            <p>In a new country the political edifice, like all the rest, must be
built from the ground up. Where nothing is at hand, every thing
must be made. There is work for all and a necessity for all to
work. There is almost perfect equality. All have an even start and
an equal chance. There are few or no factitious advantages. The
rewards of labor and skill are not only certain to come, but they
are certain to come at once. There is no long and tedious
novitiate. Talent and
<pb n="228"/>
energy are not put in quarantine, and there is no privileged
inspector to place his <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">imprimatur</foreign>
               </hi> of acceptance or rejection upon
them. An emigrant community is necessarily a practical
community; wants come before luxuries—things take precedence
of words; the necessaries that support life precede the arts and
elegancies that embellish it. A man of great parts may miss his way
to greatness by frittering away his powers upon non-essentials
—upon the style and finish of a thing rather than upon
its strength and utility—upon modes rather than upon ends. To
direct strength aright, the aim is as essential as the power. But
above all things, success more depends upon self-confidence than
any thing else; talent must go in partnership with will or it cannot
do a business of profit. Erasmus and Melancthon were the equals
of Luther in the closet; but where else were they his equals? And
where can a man get this self-reliance so well as in a new country,
where he is thrown upon his own resources; where his only friends
are his talents; where he sees energy leap at once into prominence;
where those only are above him whose talents are above his; where
there is no <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> of rank, or ancestry, or wealth, or past
reputation—and no family influence, or dependants, or patrons;
where the stranger of yesterday is the man of mark to-day;
where a single speech may win position, to be lost by a failure the
day following; and where amidst a host of competitors in an open
field of rivalry, every man of the same profession enters the
course with a race-horse emulation, to win the prize which is glittering
<pb n="229"/>
within sight of the rivals. There is no stopping in such a
crowd: he who does not go ahead is run over and trodden down.
How much of success waits on opportunity! True, the highest
energy may make opportunity; but how much of real talent is
associated only with that energy which appropriates, but which is
not able to create, occasions for its display. Does any one doubt
that if Daniel Webster had accepted the $1,500 <hi rend="italics">clerkship</hi> in New
Hampshire, he would not have been <hi rend="italics">Secretary</hi> of State? Or if
Henry Clay had been so unfortunate as to realize his early
aspirations of earning in some backwoods county his $333<corr>.</corr>33 per
annum, is it so clear that Senates would have hung upon his lips,
or Supreme Courts been enlightened by his wisdom?</p>
            <p>The exercise of our faculties not merely better enables us to
use them—it strengthens them as much; the strength lies as much
in the exercise as in the muscle; and the earlier the exercise, after
the muscle can stand it, the greater the strength.</p>
            <p>Unquestionably there is something in the atmosphere of a
new people which refreshes, vivifies and vitalizes thought, and
gives freedom, range and energy to action. It is the natural effect
of the law of liberty. An old society weaves a network of
restraints and habits around a man; the chains of habitude and
mode and fashion fetter him: he is cramped by influence,
prejudice, custom, opinion; he lives under a feeling of <hi rend="italics">surveilance</hi>
and under a sense of <hi rend="italics">espionage</hi>. He takes the law from those
above him. Wealth, family, influence, class, caste, fashion,
coterie and adventitious
<pb n="230"/>
circumstances of all sorts, in a greater or less degree, trammel
him; he acts not so much from his own will and in his own way,
as from the force of these arbitrary influences; his thoughts and
actions do not leap out directly from their only legitimate
head-spring, but flow feebly in serpentine and impeded currents,
through and around all these impediments. The character
necessarily becomes, in some sort, artificial and conventional; less
bold, simple, direct, earnest and natural, and, therefore, less
effective.</p>
            <p>What a man does well he must do with freedom. He can no
more speak in trammels than he can walk in chains; and he must
learn to think freely before he can speak freely. He must have his
audience in his mind before he has it in his eye. He must hold his
eyes level upon the court or jury—not raised in reverence nor cast
down in fear. For the nonce, <hi rend="italics">the</hi> speaker is the teacher. He must
not be sifting his discourse for deprecating epithets or propitiating
terms, nor be seeking to avoid being taken up and shaken by some
rough senior, nor be afraid of being wearisome to the audience or
disrespectful to superiors: bethinking him of exposure and dreading
the laugh or the sneer, when the bold challenge, the quick retort,
the fresh thought, the indignant crimination, the honest fervor, and
the vigorous argument are needed for his cause. To illustrate
what we mean—let us take the case of a young lawyer just come
to the bar of an old State. Let us suppose that he has a case to
argue. He is a young man of talent, of course—<hi rend="italics">all</hi> are. Who make
his audience? The old judge, who, however mild a
<pb n="231"/>
mannered man he may be, the youth has looked on, from his
childhood, as the most awful of all the sons of men. Who else?
The old seniors whom he has been accustomed to regard as the
ablest and wisest lawyers in the world, and the most terrible
satirists that ever snapped sinews and dislocated joints and laid
bare nerves on the rack of their merciless wit. The jury of sober-sided
old codgers, who have known him from a little boy, and have
never looked on him except as a boy, most imprudently diverted
by parental vanity from the bellows or the plough-handles, to be
fixed as a cannister to the dog's tail that fag-ends the bar:—that
jury look upon him,—as he rises stammering and floundering
about, like a badly-trained pointer running in several directions,
seeking to strike the cold trail of an idea that had run through his
brain in the enthusiasm of ambitious conception the night
before:—these, his judges, look at him or from him with mingled
pity and wonder; his fellow-students draw back from fear of being
brought into misprision and complicity of getting him into this
insane presumption; and, after a few awkward attempts to
propitiate the senior, who is to follow him, he catches a view of
the countenances of the old fogies in whose quiet sneers he reads
his death-warrant; and, at length, he takes his seat, as the crowd
rush up to the veteran who <hi rend="italics">is to do</hi> him—like a Spanish rabble to
an <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">auto da fe</foreign>
               </hi>. What are his feelings: What or who can describe his
mortification? What a vastation of pride and self-esteem that was?
The speech he made was not the speech he had conceived. The
speech he had in him he did not <hi rend="italics">deliver</hi>; he
<pb n="232"/>
“aborted” it, and, instead of the anticipated pride and joy of
maternity, he feels only the guilt and the shame of infanticide.</p>
            <p>Alack-a-day! Small is the sum of sympathy which is felt by
the mass of men for the woes and wounds of juvenile vanity and
especially for the woes of professional vanity. From the time of
Swift, who pilloried Bettsworth to eternal ridicule, and of
Cobbett, who, with rude contempt, scoffed at the idea of being
blamed for “crushing a lawyer in the egg,” but few tears of
commiseration have been shed for the poor “Wind-seller,” cut
down in his raw and callow youth. And, yet, I cannot help, for the
soul of me, the weakness which comes into my eyes, when I see,
as I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> seen, a gallant youth, full of ardor and hope, let down, a
dead failure,—on his first trial over the rough course of the law.
The head hung down—the cowed look of timid deprecation—the
desponding carriage—tell a story of deep wounds of spirit—of
hopes overcast, and energies subdued, and pride humbled—which
touches me deeply. I picture him in the recesses of his chamber,
wearing through the weary watches of the night—grinding his
teeth in impatient anguish,—groaning sorrowfully and wetting his
pillow with bitter tears—cursing his folly, and infatuation, and his
hard fate—envying the hod-carrier the sure success of his humbler
lot, and his security against the ill fortune of a shameful failure,
where failure was exposed presumption.</p>
            <p>I have felt, in the intensity of my concern for such an one, like
hazarding the officiousness of going to him, and advising him to
abandon the hang-dog trade, and hide his shame in some obscurer
and honest pursuit.</p>
            <pb n="233"/>
            <p>And, rough senior, my dear brother, think of these things
when your fingers itch to wool one of the tender neophytes—and
forbear. I crave no quarter for the lawyer, full-grown or half-grown;
he can stand peppering—it is his vocation, Hal—he is paid
for it; but for the lawyerling I plead; and to my own urgency in his
behalf, I add the pathetic plea of the gentle Elia in behalf of the
roast-pig—“Barbecue your whole hogs to your palate, steep
them in shalots, stuff them with the plantations of the rank and
guilty garlic; you cannot poison <hi rend="italics">them</hi> or make them stronger than
they are—but consider, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> is a weakling—a flower.”</p>
            <p>But <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">revenons à nos moutons</foreign>
               </hi>.</p>
            <p>But suppose the debutant does better than this; suppose he
lets himself out fully and fearlessly, and has something in him <hi rend="italics">to</hi>
let out; and suppose he escapes the other danger of being ruined
by presumption, real or supposed; he is duly complimented:—
“he is a young man of promise—there is some ‘come out’ to that
young man; some day he will be something—if—if” two or three
peradventures don't happen to him. If he is proud,—as to be able
to have accomplished all this he must be,—such compliments
grate more harshly than censure. He goes back to the office; but
where are the clients? They are a slow-moving race, and
confidence in a young lawyer “is a plant of slow growth.” Does
he get his books and “scorn delights and live laborious days,” for
the prospect of a remote and contingent, and that at best, but a
poorly remunerating success? Does he cool his hot blood in the
ink of the Black-letter, and spin
<pb n="234"/>
his toils with the industry and forethought of the patient spider
that is to be remunerated <hi rend="italics">next</hi> fly-season, for her pains, and sit,
like <hi rend="italics">that</hi> collecting attorney, at the door of the house, waiting and
watching until <hi rend="italics">then</hi>, for prey? If so, he is a hero indeed; but what
years of the flower of his life are not spent in waiting for the
prosperous future, in the vague preparation which is not
associated with, or stimulated by, a present use for, and direct
application to a tangible purpose of what he learns! Where one
man of real merit succeeds, how many break down in the training;
and even where success <hi rend="italics">is</hi> won, how much less that success than
where talent, like Pitt's, takes its natural position at the start, and,
stimulated to its utmost exercise, fights its way from its first
strivings to its ultimate triumphs—each day a day of activity and
every week a trial of skill and strength; learning all of law that is
evolved from its practice, and forced to know something, at least,
of what the books teach of it; and getting that larger and better
knowledge of men which books cannot impart, and that still more
important self-knowledge, of which experience is the only
schoolmaster.</p>
            <p>In the new country, there are no seniors: the bar is all Young
America. If the old fogies come in, they must stand in the class
with the rest, if, indeed, they do not “go foot.” There were many
evils and disadvantages arising from this want of standards and
authority in and over the bar—many and great—but they were not
of long continuance, and were more than counterbalanced by
opposite benefits.</p>
            <p>It strikes me that the career of Warren Hastings illustrates
<pb n="235"/>
my idea of the influence of a new country and of a new and
responsible position over the character of men of vigorous parts.
In India, new to English settlement and institutions, he well
earned the motto, “<hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Mens aequa in arduis,</foreign>
               </hi>” inscribed over his
portrait in the council chamber of Calcutta: but after he returned
to England, amidst the difficulties of his impeachment, his policy
ignored all his claims to greatness, had it alone been considered:
the genius that expatiated over and permeated his broad policy on
the plains of Hindostan seemed stifled in the conventional
atmosphere of St. Stephen's.</p>
            <p>While we think that the influence of the new country upon
the intellect of the professional <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">emigré</foreign>
               </hi> was highly beneficial, we
speak, we hope, with a becoming distrust, of its moral effect. We
might, in a debating club, tolerate some scruple of a doubt,
whether this violent disruption of family ties—this sudden
abandonment of the associations and influence of country and of
home—of the restraints of old authority and of opinion—and this
sudden plunge into the whirling vortex of a new and seething
population—in which the elements were curiously and variously
mixed with free manners and not over-puritanic
conversation—were efficient causes of moral improvement: we
can tolerate a doubt as to whether the character of a young man
might not receive something less than a pious impression, under
these circumstances of temptation, when that character was in its
most malleable and fusible state. But we leave this moral
problem to be solved by those better able to manage it, with
<pb n="236"/>
this single observation, that if the subject <hi rend="italics">were</hi> able to stand the
trial, his moral constitution, like his physical after an attack of
yellow fever, would be apt to be the better for it. We cannot,
however, in conscience, from what we have experienced of a new
country with “flush fixins” annexed, advise the experiment. We
<hi rend="italics">have</hi> known it to fail. And probably more of character would have
been lost if more had been put at hazard.</p>
            <p>In trying to arrive at the character of the South-Western bar, its
opportunities and advantages for improvement are to be
considered. It is not too much to say that, in the United States at
least, no bar ever had such, or so many: it might be doubted if they
were <hi rend="italics">ever</hi> enjoyed to the same extent before. Consider that the
South-West was the focus of an emigration greater than any
portion of the country ever attracted, at least, until the golden
magnet drew its thousands to the Pacific coast. But the character
of emigrants was not the same. Most of the gold-seekers were
mere gold-diggers—not bringing property, but coming to take it
away. Most of those coming to the South-West brought
property—many of them a great deal. Nearly every man was a
speculator; at any rate, a trader. The treaties with the Indians had
brought large portions of the States of Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana into market; and these portions, comprising some of the
most fertile lands in the world, were settled up in a hurry. The
Indians claimed lands under these treaties—the laws granting
   rights to settlers on the public lands, were to be
<pb n="237"/>
construed, and the litigation growing out of them settled, the
public lands afforded a field for unlimited speculation, and
combinations of purchasers, partnerships, land companies,
agencies, and the lilies gave occasion to much difficult litigation in
after times. Negroes were brought into the country in large
numbers and sold mostly upon credit, and bills of exchange taken
for the price; the negroes in many instances were unsound—some
as to which there was no title; some falsely pretended to be
unsound, and various questions as to the liability of parties on the
warranties and the bills, furnished an important addition to the
litigation: many land titles were defective; property was brought
from other States clogged with trusts, limitations, and uses, to be
construed according to the laws of the State from which it was
brought: claims and contracts made elsewhere to be enforced here:
universal indebtedness, which the hardness of the times succeeding
made it impossible for many men to pay, and desirable for all to
escape paying: hard and ruinous bargains, securityships, judicial
sales; a general looseness, ignorance, and carelessness in the public
officers in doing business; new statutes to be construed; official
liabilities, especially those of sheriffs, to be enforced; banks, the
laws governing their contracts, proceedings against them for
forfeiture of charter; trials of right of property; an elegant
assortment of frauds constructive and actual; and the whole
system of chancery law, admiralty proceedings; in short, all the
flood-gates of litigation were opened and the pent-up tide let loose
upon the country. And such
<pb n="238"/>
a criminal docket! What could boast more largely of its crimes?
What more splendid rôle of felonies! What more terrific murders!
What more gorgeous bank robberies! What more magnificent
operations in the land offices! Such McGregor-like levies of black
mail, individual and corporate! Such superb forays on the
treasuries, State and National! Such expert transfers of balances to
undiscovered bournes! Such august defalcations! Such flourishes
of rhetoric on ledgers auspicious of gold which had departed for
ever from the vault! And in INDIAN affairs!—the very mention
is suggestive of the poetry of theft—the romance of a wild and
weird larceny! What sublime conceptions of super-Spartan
roguery! Swindling Indians by the nation! (<hi rend="italics">Spirit of Falstaff, rap!</hi>)
Stealing their land by the township! (<hi rend="italics">Dick Turpin and Jonathan
Wild! tip the table!</hi>) Conducting the nation to the Mississippi river,
stripping them to the flap, and bidding them God speed as they
went howling into the Western wilderness to the friendly agency of
some sheltering Suggs duly empowered to receive their coming
annuities and back rations! What's Hounslow heath to this? Who
Carvajal? Who Count Boulbon?</p>
            <p>And all these merely forerunners, ushering in the Millennium
of an accredited, official Repudiation; and IT but vaguely
suggestive of what men could do when opportunity and capacity
met—as shortly afterwards they did—under the Upas-shade of a
perjury-breathing bankrupt law!—But we forbear. The
contemplation of such hyperboles of mendacity
<pb n="239"/>
stretches the imagination to a dangerous tension. There
was no end to the amount and variety of lawsuits, and interests
involved in every complication and of enormous value were to be
adjudicated. The lawyers were compelled to work, and were
forced to learn the rules that were involved in all this litigation.</p>
            <p>Many members of the bar, of standing and character, from the
other States, flocked in to put their sickles into this abundant
harvest. Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee
contributed more of these than any other four States; but every
State had its representatives.</p>
            <p>Consider, too, that the country was not so new as the practice.
Every State has its peculiar tone or physiognomy, so to speak, of
jurisprudence imparted to it, more or less, by the character and
temper of its bar. That had yet to be given. Many questions
decided in older States, and differently decided in different States,
were to be settled here; and a new state of things, peculiar in their
nature, called for new rules or a modification of old ones. The
members of the bar from different States had brought their various
notions, impressions and knowledge of their own judicature along
with them; and thus all the points, dicta, rulings, offshoots, quirks
and quiddities of all the law, and lawing, and law-mooting of all the
various judicatories and their satellites, were imported into the
new country and tried on the new jurisprudence.</p>
            <p>After the crash came in 1837—(there were some <hi rend="italics">premonitory
fits</hi> before, but <hi rend="italics">then</hi> the <hi rend="italics">great convulsion</hi> came on)
<pb n="240"/>
—all the assets of the country were marshalled, and the suing
material of all sorts, as fast as it could be got out, put into the hands
of the workmen. Some idea of the business may be got from a fact
or two: in the county of Sumpter, Alabama, in one year, some four
or five thousand suits, in the common-law courts alone, were
brought; but in some other counties the number was larger; while
in the lower or river counties of Mississippi, the number was at
least double. The United States Courts were equally well
patronized in proportion—indeed, rather more so. The white
<hi rend="italics">suable</hi> population of Sumpter was then some 2,400 men. It was
a merry time for us craftsmen; and we brightened up mightily, and
shook our quills joyously, like goslings in the midst of a shower.
We look back to that good time, “now past and gone,” with the
pious gratitude and serene satisfaction with which the wreckers
near the Florida Keys contemplate the last fine storm.</p>
            <p>It was a pleasant sight to professional eyes to see a whole
people let go all holds and meaner business, and move off to
court, like the Californians and Australians to the mines: the
“pockets” were picked in both cases. As law and lawing soon got
to be the staple productions of the country, the people, as a
whole the most intelligent—in the wealthy counties—of the rural
population of the United States, and, as a part, the <hi rend="italics">keenest</hi> in all
creation, got very well “up to trap” in law matters; indeed, they
soon knew more about the delicate mysteries of the law, than it
behooves an honest man to know.</p>
            <pb n="241"/>
            <p>The necessity for labor and the habit of taking difficulties
by the horns is a wonderful help to a man; no one knows what he
can accomplish until he tries his best; or how firmly he can stand
on his own logs when he has no one to lean on.</p>
            <p>The range of practice was large. The lawyer had to practise in
all sorts of courts, State and Federal, inferior and Supreme. He
had the bringing up of a lawsuit, from its girth in the writ to its
grave in the sheriff's docket. Even when not concerned in his own
business, his observation was employed in seeing the business of
others going on; and the general excitement on the subject of law
and litigation, taking the place, in the partial supension of other
business, of other excitements, supplied the usual topics of
general, and, more especially, of professional conversation. If he
followed the circuit, he was always in law: the temple of Themis,
like that of Janus in war, was always open.</p>
            <p>The bar of every country is, in some sort, a representative of
the character of the people of which it is so important an
“institution.” We have partly shown what this character was: after
the great Law revival had set in, the public mind had got to be as
acute, excited, inquisitive on the subject of law, as that of
Tennessee or Kentucky on politics: every man knew a little and
many a great deal on the subject. The people soon began to find
out the capacity and calibre of the lawyers. Besides, the multitude
and variety of lawsuits produced their necessary effect. The
talents of the lawyers soon adapted themselves to the nature and
exigencies of the service required
<pb n="242"/>
of them, and to the tone and temper of the juries and public.
Law had got to be an every-day, practical, common-place,
business-like affair, and it had to be conducted in the same spirit
on analogous principles. Readiness, precision, plainness,
pertinency, knowledge of law, and a short-hand method of getting
at and getting through with a case, were the characteristics and
desiderata of the profession. There was no time for wasting words,
or for manaeuvring and skirmishing about a suit; there was no
patience to be expended on exordiums and perorations: few jurors
were to be humbugged by demagogical appeals; and the audience
were more concerned to know what was to become of the negroes
in suit, than to see the flights of an ambitious rhetoric, or to have
their ears fed with vain repetitions, meek sentimentality, or tumid
platitudes. To start <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">in medias res</foreign>
               </hi>—to drive at the centre—to make
the home-thrust—to grasp the hinging point—to give out and
prove the law, and to reason strongly on the facts—to wrestle
with the subject Indian-hug fashion—to speak in plain English
and fervid, it mattered not how rough, sincerity, were the qualities
required: and these qualities were possessed in an eminent degree.</p>
            <p>Most questions litigated are questions of law: in nine cases
out of ten tried, the jury, if intelligent and impartial, have no
difficulty in deciding after the law has been plainly given them by
the court: there is nothing for a jury to do but to settle the
facts, and these are not often seriously controverted, in
proportion to the number of cases tried in a new country; and the
habit of examining carefully, and arguing
<pb n="243"/>
fully, legal propositions, is the habit which makes the
lawyer. Nothing so debilitates and corrupts a healthy taste and
healthy thought, as the habit of addressing ignorant juries; it
corrupts style and destroys candor; it makes a speech, which
ought to be an enlightened exposition of the legal merits of a
cause, a mere mass of “skimble skamble stuff,” a compound of
humbug, rant, cant and hypocrisy, of low, demagoguism and
flimsy perversions—of interminable wordiness and infinite
repetition, exaggeration, bathos and vituperation—frequently of
low wit and buffoonery—which “causes the judicious to grieve,”
“though it splits the ears of the goundlings.” I do not say that the
new bar was free from these traits and vices: by no manner of
means but I do say that they were, as a class, much freer than the
bar of the older States out of the commercial cities. The reason is
plain: the new dogs hadn't learned the old tricks; and if they had
tricks as bad, it was a great comfort that they did not have the
same. If we had not improvement, we had, at least, variety; but, I
think, we had improvement.</p>
            <p>There was another thing: the bar and the community—as all
emigrant communities—were mostly young, and the young men
cannot afford to play the pranks which the old fogies safely play
behind the domino of an established reputation. What is
ridiculous, in itself or in a young man, may be admired, or not
noticed, in an older leader with a prescriptive title to cant and
humbug; it is  <hi rend="italics">lese majesty</hi>  to take him off, but the juniors with us had
no such immunity. If he tried such tricks he heard of it again; it
was rehearsed in
<pb n="244"/>
his presence for his benefit—if he made himself <hi rend="italics">very</hi> ridiculous,
he was carried around the circuit, like a hung jury in old times, for
the especial divertisement of the brethren. A respectable old snob
like Mr. Buzzfuz, shrouded like Jack the Giant Killer, in a mantle
of dignity that forbade approach, if it did not hide the wearer
from attack, never could hear what his“d-d good-natured
friends” thought of his performances in the department of
humbug or cant; but this was, by no means, the case with such an
one in our younger community.</p>
            <p>Again, it is flattering to human nature to know that these
forensic tricks are not spontaneous but acquired, and a young bar
cannot, all at once, acquire them. It requires experience, and a
monstrous development of the organs of Reverence and
Marvellousness in the audience to practise them with any hope
of success, and these bumps were almost entirely wanting in the
craniums of the new population around, all of whose eye-teeth
were fully cut, and who, standing knee-deep in exploded
humbugs, seemed to wear their eyes stereotyped into a fixed,
unwinking <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">qui vive</foreign>
               </hi>: the very expression of their countenances
seemed to be articulate with the interrogatory, “who is to be
picked up next?” It stops curiously the flow of the current when
the humbugger sees the intended humbuggee looking him, with a
quizzical 'cuteness, in the eye. and seeming to say by the
expression of his own, “Squire, do you see any thing green here?”</p>
            <p>The business of court-house speaking began to grow too
common and extensive to excite public interest; the novelty
<pb n="245"/>
of the thing, after a while, wore off. A stream of sound poured
over the land like the trade winds; men now, as a general thing,
only came to court because they had business there, and staid
only until it was accomplished. It is otherwise in the old country
as it had been in the new. It is one of the phenomena of mind that
quiet and otherwise sensible men, come from their homes to the
county seat to listen to the speeches of the lawyers,—looking
over the bar and dropping the under jaw in rapt attention, when
some forensic Boreas is blowing away at a case in which they
have no interest or concern, deserting, for this queer
divertisement, the splitting of their rails and their attention to
their bullocks; or, if they needed some relaxation from such
pursuits, neglecting their arm-chairs in the passage with the
privilege of reading an old almanac or listening to the wind
whistling through the key-hole. When a thing gets to be a work-day
and common-place affair, it is apt to be done in a
commonplace way, and the parade, tinsel, and fancy fireworks of
a holiday exercise or a gala-day fête are, apt to be omitted from
the bill and the boards.</p>
            <p>It is a great mistake to suppose that a lawyer's strength lies
chiefly in his tongue; it is in the preparation of his case—in
knowing what makes the case—in stating the case accurately in
the papers, and getting out and getting up the proofs. It requires a
good lawyer to make a fine argument; but he is a better lawyer
who saves the necessity of making a fine argument, and prevents
the possibility of his adversary's making one.</p>
            <pb n="246"/>
            <p>These practical requirements and habits had the effect of
driving from the bar that forensic nuisance, “a pretty speaker;”
Fourth-of-Julyisms fled to the stump or the national anniversary
barbecues; they were out of place in those prosaic times and
proceedings. A veteran litigant having a tough lawsuit, had as
little use for a flowery orator, letting off his fancy pyrotechnics,
as he had for Juno's team of peacocks for hauling his cotton to
market.</p>
            <p>Between the years 1833 and 1845, the bar was most
numerous, and, we think, on the whole, most able. The Supreme
Court bar of Mississippi was characterized by signal ability. It
may well be doubted if so able and efficient a bar ever existed at
any one period of the same duration, in a Southern State: not that
the bar was made up of Wickhams, Leighs, Johnsons, and
Stanards, nor of Clays, Crittendens, Rowans, and Wickliffes; nor,
possibly, that there were any members of the Jackson bar equal
to these great names of the Richmond and Frankfort bars; yet
those who have heard the best efforts of Prentiss, Holt, Walker,
Yerger, Mays, and Boyd, may be allowed to doubt the justness
of that criticism which would deny a place to them among
lawyers even so renowned as the shining lights of the Virginia and
Kentucky forums. But we meant to say, that if this claim be
ignored, yet the Mississippi bar, if not so distinguished for
individual eminence, made up the deficiency by a more
generally-diffused ability, and a larger number of members
of inferior, though only a shade inferior, distinction.</p>
            <pb n="247"/>
            <p>As some proof of the ability of the South-western bar, it may
be stated, that we had not unfrequently an advent into the new
country of lawyers of considerable local reputation in the older
States—men who, in their own bailiwicks, were mighty men of
War—so distinguished, indeed, that on the first bruiting of a
lawsuit, the litigants, without waiting for the ferry-boat, would
swim Tar river, or the Pedee, or French Broad, to get to them,
under the idea that who got to them first would gain the case. But
after the first bustle of their coming with the fox-fire of their old
reputations sticking to their gowns, it was generally found, to the
utter amazement of their friends who had known them in the old
country, that the new importation would not suit the market.
They usually fell back from the position at first courteously
tendered them, and, not unfrequently, receded until, worked out
of profitable practice, they took their places low down in the list,
or were lost behind the bar, among the spectators. There is
something doubtless in transplantation—something in racing over
one's own training-paths—something in first firing with a rest, and
then being compelled to fire off-hand amid a general flutter and
confusion; but, making all this allowance, it hardly accounts fully
for the result. For we know that others, against these
disadvantages, sustained themselves.</p>
            <p>Nor was there, nor is there, any bar that better illustrates the
higher properties or nobler characteristics which have, in every
State, so much ennobled the profession of the law, than that of
the South-West, a class of men more fearless
<pb n="248"/>
or more faithful, more chivalrous, reliable or trustworthy,
more loyal to professional obligations, or more honorable
inter-professional intercourse and relations. True, there were
exceptions, as, at all times and every where, there are and will be.
Bullying insolence, swaggering pretension, underhanded arts, low
detraction, unworthy huckstering for fees, circumvention, artful
dodges, ignoring engagements, facile obliviousness of
arrangements, and a smart sprinkling, especially in the early times
of pettifogging, quibbling and quirking, but these vices are rather
of persons than of caste, and not often found; and, when they
make themselves apparent, are scouted with scorn by the better
members of the bar.</p>
            <p>We should be grossly misunderstood if we were construed to
imply that the bar of the South-West, possessing the signal
opportunities and advantages to which we have adverted, so
improved them that all of its members became good lawyers and
honorable gentlemen. Mendacity itself could scarcely be supposed
to assert what no credulity could believe. All the guano of Lobos
could not make Zahara a garden. In too many cases there was no
sub-soil of mind or morals on which these advantages could rest.
As Chief Justice Collier, in Dargan and Waring, 17 Ala. Reports,
in language, marrying the manly strength and beauty of
Blackstone to the classic elegance and flexible grace of Stowell,
expresses it, “the claim of such,” so predicated, “would be <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">pro
tanto</foreign>
               </hi> absolutely void, and, having nothing to rest on, a court of
equity” (or law) “could not impart to it vitality.
<pb n="249"/>
Form and order <hi rend="italics">has</hi> been given to chaos, but an appeal to equity”
(or law) “to breathe life into a nonentity, which is both
intangible and imperceptible, supposes a higher power—one
which no human tribunal can rightfully exercise. <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Aequitas
sequitur legem</foreign>
               </hi>.” This view is conclusive.</p>
            <p>We should have been pleased to say something of the bench,
especially of that of the Supreme Court of Alabama and
Mississippi, but neither our space nor the patience of the reader
will permit.</p>
            <p>A writer usually catches something from, as well as
communicates something to, his subject. Hence if, in the
statements of this paper, we shall encounter the incredulity of
some old fogy of an older bar, and he should set us down as little
better than a romancer in prose, we tea him to consider that we
have had two or three regiments of lawyers for our theme—and
be charitable.</p>

            <head>THE HON. FRANCIS STROTHER.</head>
            <p>I NIB my pen and impart to it a fine hair-stroke, in order that I may
give the more delicate touches which can alone show forth the
character of this distinguished gentleman. It is no ordinary
character, and yet it is most difficult to draw. There are no sharp
angles, no salient points which it is impossible to miss, and
which serve as handles whereby to hold up a character to public
view. The lines are delicate, the grain fine, the features regular, the
contour full, rounded and perfectly developed, nowhere feeble or
stunted, and nowhere disproportioned. He is the type of a glass,
unfortunately of a small class; more unfortunately of a class
rapidly disappearing in the hurry-burly of this fast age of steam
pressure and railway progress: a gentleman of the Old School with
the energy of the New.</p>
            <p>If I hold the pencil in hand in idle reverie, it is because my
mind rests lovingly upon a picture I feel incapable of transcribing
with fidelity to the original: I feel that the coarse copy I shall
make will do no justice to the image on the mind; and, therefore, I
pause a moment, to look once
<pb n="251"/>
more at the original before it is obscured by the rude counterpart.</p>
            <p>Fifteen years ago—long years crowded with changes and
events—such changes as are only effected in <hi rend="italics">our</hi> country within
so short a period,—the savage disappearing—the frontier-man
following on to a further border—that border, like the horizon,
widening and stretching out towards the sinking sun, as we go
on;—<hi rend="italics">then</hi>, the rude settlement, <hi rend="italics">now</hi> the improved neighborhood,
with its school-houses and churches; the log cabin giving way to
the mansion,—the wilderness giving way to the garden and the
farm; fifteen years ago, I first saw him. He was then, so far as I
can remember, what he is now:—no perceptible change has
occurred in any outward or inner characteristic, except that now a
pair of spectacles occasionally may be found upon his nose, as
that unresting pen sweeps in bold and beautiful chirography
across his paper; a deeper tinge of gray may be seen in his hair,
and possibly too, his slight, but graceful and well-knit form may
be a trifle less active than of old. I put these as possibilities—not
as matters I can note.</p>
            <p>The large, well-developed head—the mild, quiet, strong
face—the nose, slightly aquiline—the mouth, firm yet
fiexible—the slightly elongated chin—the shape of the head oval,
and protruding largely behind the ears in the region that supplies
the motive powers, would not have conveyed a right meaning did
not the blue eyes, strong yet kind, beaming out the mingled
expression of intelligence and benignity, which, above all other
marks, is the unmistakable, uncounterfeitable
<pb n="252"/>
outward sign of a true gentleman, relieve and mellow the
picture. The voice kind, social, gentle—and the whole manner
deferential, simple, natural and winning—self-poised, modest,
friendly, and yet delicate and gracefully dignified. <hi rend="italics">Dignified</hi> is
scarcely an apt word in the vulgar meaning attached to it; for there
was no idea of self, much less of pretension or affectation
connected with his manner or bearing. But there was, towards high
and low, rich and poor, a genuine and unaffected kindness and
friendliness, which every man who approached him felt had
something in it peculiarly sweet towards him; and made the most
unfriended outcast feel there was, at least, <hi rend="italics">one</hi> man in the world
who felt an interest in and sympathy for him and his fortunes.
Towards the young especially was this exhibited, and by them
was it appreciated. A child would come to him with the feeling of
familiarity and a sense of affectionate consideration; and a young
man, just coming to the bar, felt that he had found one who would
be glad to aid him in his struggles and encourage him in difficulty.
Were this rare manner a thing of art and but a manual gone through
with—put on for effect—it could not have been long maintained
or long undiscovered. But it was the same all the time—and the
effect the same. We need scarcely say that the effect was to give
the subject of it a popularity well nigh universal. It was a
popularity which during years of active life in all departments of
business affairs, public and private—all the strifes of rivalry and
collisions of interest never shook. The fiercest oppositions of
party left him uninjured in fame or appreciation: indeed
<pb n="253"/>
no party ties were strong enough to resist a popularity so deep
and wide.</p>
            <p>He had passed through the strong temptations which beset a
man in a new country, and <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a country, unscathed, unsoiled
even by suspicion, and ever maintained a reputation above
question or challenge. It were easy to have accumulated an
immense fortune by an agency for the Indians in securing their
claims under the treaty of 1830; and he was offered the agency
with a compensation which would have made him a millionnaire;
he took the agency but rejected the fortune.</p>
            <p>He was the genius of labor. His unequalled facility in the
dispatch of business surprised all who knew its extent. Nothing
was omitted—nothing flurried over—nothing bore marks of haste,
nothing was done out of time. System—order—punctuality
waited upon him as so many servants to that patient and
indomitable industry. He had a rare tact in getting at, and in getting
through, a thing. He saw at once the point. He never missed the
joint of the argument. He never went to opening the oyster at the
wrong end. He never turned over and over a subject to find out
what to do with it or how to commence work. He caught the <hi rend="italics">run</hi>
of the facts—moulded the scheme of his treatment of them—saw
their right relations, value and dependence, and then started at
once, in ready, fluent and terse English, to put them on paper or
marshal them in speech. His power of statement was remarkable,
especially of written statement. He could make more out of a fact
than most men out of two:
<pb n="254"/>
and immaterial matters he could so dove-tail and attach to other
matters, that they left an impression of a great deal of plausibility
and pertinency.</p>
            <p>He loved labor for its own sake as some men love ease. There
was no part of office-work drudgery to him. He carried his writing
materials about with him as some men their canes: and that busy
pen, at a moment's notice, was speeding over the paper,
throwing the g's and y's behind at a rapid rate.</p>
            <p>A member of Congress—he was in the House, defending the
Pre-emption System, out of it, attending to some business before
the departments; in again, writing with a pile of letters before him;
in the committee room, busy with <hi rend="italics">its</hi> business: again, before the
Secretary of War, arguing some question about the Dancing Rabbit
Treaty, 14th article:—and then consulting the Attorney General,
so that persons who had no knowledge of his ubiquitous habits,
seeing him at one of these places, would have been willing to have
sworn an alibi for him if charged with being that morning at any
other.</p>
            <p>Returning to the practice, it was the same thing. The
management and care of his own property—his attention to a
large family and household affairs—these things would have made
some inroads upon another's time, but these and a large practice,
extended over many courts and several of the wealthiest
counties of the State, at a time when every man was a client, did
not seem to press upon him. He could turn himself from one
subject to another with wonderful ease: the hinges of his mind
moved as if oiled, in any direction.
<pb n="255"/>
Trying an important case in the Circuit Court, as the jury
retired and the Court was calling some other case, he would
propose to the opposite counsel to go down into the Orphan's
Court, and try a case there, involving a few thousands; and that
dispatched, might be found in the Chancery office preparing a suit
for trial there; which finished, he would hear the result of the law
case, and, by the meeting of Court, have (if decided adversely) a
bill of exceptions ready, of a sheet or two of foolscap, or a bill for
an injunction to take the case into Chancery. At night, he would
be ready for a reference before the Master of an account of
partnership transactions of vast amount; and, as he walked into
Court next morning, would merely call by to file a score or two of
exceptions; and, in all the time, would carry on his consultations
and prepare the cases coming on for trial, and be ready to enjoy a
little social conversation with his brethren. In all this, there was no
bustle, hurry, parade, fuss, or excitement. He moved like the
Ericsson motor, without noise, the only evidence that it was
moving being the progress made.</p>
            <p>He was never out of temper, never flurried, never excited.
There was a serious, patient expression in the eyes, which showed
a complete mastery of all things that trouble the nervous system.
Even when he complained—as he often did—it was not a testy,
ill-natured, peevish grumbling, but seemingly the complaint of a
good, gentle nature, whose meekness was a little too sternly tried.
He never abused any body. He had no use for sarcasm or
invective. Even when
<pb n="256"/>
prosecuting for crime a heinous criminal, he used the language
of civility, if not of kindness. Indeed, he seemed to seek a
conviction from a sheer feeling of consideration for the prisoner.
He would cross-examine a swift or perjured witness in a tone of
kindness which seemed anxious to relieve him from
embarrassment; and plying with great tact question after
question, would, when the witness faltered and stammered or
broke down, seem to feel a lively sentiment of commiseration for
his unfortunate predicament. In commenting upon his testimony,
he would attribute his unhappy course to any thing but wilful
misstatement—to strange hallucination, prejudice, an excitable
temperament, want of memory, or even to dreaming: but still the
right impression was always left, if in no other way, by the
elaborate disclaimers and apologies, that, with such persistent and
pertinacious over-kindness, he made for the delinquent<corr>.</corr>
            </p>
            <p>There was business skill in every thing he did. His arguments
were clear, brief, pointed—never wandering, discursive or
episodical—never over-worked, or over-laden, or over-elaborated.
He took all the points—took them clearly, expressed them neatly
and fully—knew when to press a point and when to glide over it
quickly, and above all—what so few know—he knew when he
was done. His tone was that of animated conversation, his
manner courteous, respectful, impressive and persuasive: never
offending good taste, never hurried away by imprudence or
compromising his case by a point that could be made to reach it;
and probably making as few imprudent admissions as any
member of the bar.</p>
            <pb n="257"/>
            <p>But in many of these points he was equalled; in one he was
not—his tact in drawing papers. In a paper showing for a
continuance or for a change of venue, the skill with which the
facts were marshalled and conclusions insinuated was remarkable.
Like shot-silk the light glanced over and along the whole
statement, though it was often hard to find precisely where it was
or what made it; yet, if admitted, a little emphasis or a slight
connection with extraneous matter would put his adversary's case
in a dangerous position.</p>
            <p>A more pliant, facile, complying gentleman than the Hon.
Francis, it was impossible to find on a summer's day,—so
truthful, so credulous, so amiably uncontroverting. It seemed
almost a pity to take advantage of such simplicity, to impose
upon such deferential confidence! Such innocence deserved to be
respected, and like the Virgin in the fable, sleeping by the lion, one
would think that it ought to carry in its trusting purity a charm
against wrong from the most savage brutality or the most
unscrupulous mendacity. This view of the subject, I am forced to
say, does not quite represent the fact. The Hon. Francis <hi rend="italics">was</hi> very
limber—but it was the limberness of whalebone, gum-elastic, steel
springs and gutta percha—limber because tough—easily bowed,
but impossible to be broken or kept down. He had great
suavity—but it was only the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo</foreign>
               </hi>. Substantially and
essentially he was <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">fortiter in re</foreign>
               </hi>—mechanically he was <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">suaviter in
modo</foreign>
               </hi>: the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">suaviter</foreign>
               </hi> was only the running gear by which he
worked the <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">fortiter</foreign>
               </hi>. In his own private affairs no man was more
liberal and yielding, or less exacting or
<pb n="258"/>
pertinacious; professionally, his concessions took the form of,
and exhausted their energies in beneficent words, benignant
seamings and gracious gestures. But his manner was inimitably
munificent. Though he gave nothing, he went through the motions
of giving most grandly; empty-handed you felt that you were full;
you mistook the filling of your ears for some substantial benefit to
your client; there was an affluence of words, a lingual and manual
generosity which almost seemed to transpose the figures on the
statement which he proposed as a settlement. With a grand
self-abnegation, he would allow you to continue a cause when his side
was not ready to try it, and would most blandly merely insist on
your paying the costs, magnanimously waiving further advantage
of your situation. He would suffer you to take a non-suit with an
air of kindness calculated to rivet a sense of eternal obligation. No
man revelled in a more princely generosity than he when he gave
away nothing. And to carry out the self-delusion, he <hi rend="italics">took</hi> with the
air of giving a bounty. Before his manner of marvellous concession
all impediments and precedence vanished. If he had a case at the
end of the docket, he always managed to get it tried first: if the
arrangement of the docket did not suit his convenience, his
convenience changed it by a sort of not-before understood, but
taken-for-granted general consent of the bar. There was such a
matter-of-course about his polite propositions, that for a good
while, no one ever thought of resisting them; indeed, most lawyers,
under the spell of his infatuating manners half-recollected
some sort of agreement
<pb n="259"/>
which was never made. In the trial of a cause he would slip in
testimony on you in such a cozy, easy, insinuating fashion, that
you were ruined before you could rally to oppose it. Even
witnesses could not resist the graciousness and affectionateness
of his manner, the confidence with which he rested on their
presumed knowledge:—they thought they must know what he
evidently knew so well and so authentically.</p>
            <p>He lifted great weights as the media do heavy tables without
any show of strength.</p>
            <p>The Hon. Francis had no doubts. He had passed from this
world of shadows to a world of perfect light and knowledge. He
had the rare luck of always being on the right side: and then he had
all the points that could be made on that side clearly in his favor,
and all that could be made against him were clearly wrong. He was
never taken off his guard. If a witness swore him out of court, he
could not swear him out of countenance. He expected it. His case
was better than he feared. In the serene confidence of unshakable
faith in his cause, brickbats foil on his mind like snowflakes,
melting as they fell, and leaving no impression. If he had but one
witness, and you had six against him, long after the jury had
ceased listening and when you concluded, he would mildly ask
you if that was <hi rend="italics">all</hi> your proof, and if you proposed going to the
jury on that?</p>
            <p>But if the Hon. Francis had no doubts, he had an enormous
development of the organ of wonder. He had a note of
admiration in his eye as large as a ninepin. He wondered
<pb n="260"/>
that a party should have brought <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a suit; that another had
set up such a defence; that the counsel should have taken such a
point; that the court should have made such a ruling (with great
deference), and he wondered that the Supreme Court had sustained
it. <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Nil admirari </foreign>
               </hi>was not his maxim.</p>
            <p>I was a little too fast when I said he was never taken by
surprise. He was once—indeed twice. Casually looking at some
papers Blass held in his hand, as an important case was being
called for trial, he saw what he took to be a release of the action
by one of the nominal plaintiffs: in order to avoid the effect of
this paper, he applied for a continuance, which it was never
difficult for him to obtain. Finding out afterwards his mistake, he
moved to set aside the order of continuance. It required a lion-like
boldness to make and assign the grounds of the motion: this effort
he essayed with his usual ingenuity. He commenced by speaking
of Blass's high character—that he had been deceived by the real
and implied assurance of B.—that he acquitted B. of all intentional
impropriety: he entered into a most elaborate disclaimer of all
injurious imputation: he spoke only of the effect: he had only
seen hastily a paper endorsed as a release: he should be surprised
if the gentleman would hold him to the order taken under such
circumstances of mistake—a mistake which had misled him, and
which he took the earliest opportunity of correcting. “In other
words,” said B., “you peeped into my hand and mistook the
card, and now you want to renig because your eyes fooled
you.” “Ahem!” said S., “I have
<pb n="261"/>
already stated the facts.” “Well,” said B., pulling out the paper,
“I will let you set aside the order if you promise to go to trial.”
“No,” S. answered, “I believe not: on further reflection, perhaps it
might be irregular.”</p>
            <p>On another occasion he had been cross-examining an Irishman,
and the Hibernian desiring to come prepared to make a display in
affidavit elocution, had written out his testimony at length: but
having got drunk he had dropped the MS., which being found by
the client of Mr. S., was put into his hands. Mr. S. opened the
paper and inquired of the witness, “Mr. McShee, did you ever
see this paper before: have the kindness to look at it?” The
witness snatched up the paper and answered quickly, “Sure,
yes—it's mine, Misther Strother, I lost it meself, and where is the
$5 bill I put in it?”</p>
            <p>Being pressed for time, one morning, Mr. S. entered a barber's
shop in Mobile, where he saw a brother lawyer of the Sumter bar,
Jemmy O., highly lathered, sitting in much state in the chair
waiting for the bar<hi rend="italics">berian</hi> to sharpen his blade. Mr. S. addressed
his old acquaintance with great warmth and cordiality—requested
him to keep his seat— begged him not to be at all uneasy on his
account—protested that he was not in his way—he could
wait—not to think of putting him to trouble—pulled off his
cravat—it was no intrusion—not at all—by no means—politely
disclaimed, affirmed and protested—until J.O., thinking that Mr.
S. somehow had precedence, got up and insisted on Mr. S. taking
the chair, to which Mr. S., like Donna Julia, “vowing he would
ne'er consent, consented”—was duly shaved—
<pb n="262"/>
all the while protesting against it—and went out, leaving J<corr>.</corr> O. to
think he was the politest man he had ever met with.</p>
            <p>When J.O. afterwards found out that S. had no precedence,
he said he had been taught a new chapter of law—the title by
disclaimer.</p>
            <p>At length the Hon. Mr. Strother got his hands full. He got at
last to the long wished for enjoyment which was to reward the
trials of his earlier years. He was made commissioner of the State
Banks of Alabama. He had it all to himself. No partner shared
with him this luxurious repast. Such a mass and mess of
confusion—such a bundle of heterogeneous botches; in which
blundering stupidity, reckless inattention, and both intelligent and
ignorant rascality had made their tracks and figures, never before
was seen. He was to bring order out of chaos—reconcile
discrepancies—supply whole pages of ledgers—balance
unbalanceable accounts—understand the unintelligible—collect
debts involved in all mazes of legal defences, or slumbering cozily
in chancery—to bring all sorts of agents to all sorts of
settlements—to compromise bad debts—disencumber clogged
property—to keep up a correspondence like that of the Pension
Bureau—and manage the finances of the State government. The
State trembled on the verge of Repudiation; if the assets of the
banks were lost, the honor of the State was gone. The road
through the Bank operations was like the road through Hounslow
heath, every step a robbery. To bring the authors to their
responsibility—to hunt up and hunt down absconding debtors
and speculators
<pb n="263"/>
—to be every where at once—to be in Boston, Mobile, New
Orleans, New-York—and then to keep up his practice in several
counties just for holiday refreshment, were some of the labors he
performed.</p>
            <p>He succeeded wonderfully. He kept untarnished the honor of
the State. He restored its solvency, and, clothed with such vast
trusts, greater than were ever before confided, perhaps, in the
South-West to a single man, he discharged them with a fidelity
which can neither be exaggerated nor denied. He, like Falstaff,
“turned diseases to commodity:” the worthless assets of the
Banks were turned into State Bonds; and the State, relieved of the
pressure upon her resources, rose up at once to her place of
honor in the sisterhood of States, and shone, with a new and
fresher lustre, not the least in that bright galaxy. Relieved of her
embarrassments, in no small degree through the instrumentality of

            <head>MR. TEE AND MR. GEE.</head>
            <p>ONE of the most distinguished lawyers in the State of
Misssissippi, was W.Y. Gee, Esq. He was distinguished not less for
his legal learning than for the acuteness and subtlety of his
intellect. He was fond of exercising his talents in legal
speculations, and was pleased when some new and difficult point
was presented for solution. John S. Tee, Esq., was not of that
sort. <hi rend="italics">He</hi> was a man of facts and figures, and practical and stern
realities. He cared nothing about a lawsuit except for the proofs
and what appeared on the back of the execution, and thought the
best <hi rend="italics">Report</hi> ever made of a case was that made by the sheriff. He
was completely satisfied if the Fi-fa was. He was doing a large
collecting business; he prided himself more on the skill with
which he worked on a promissory note than he would have done
if he had pinned Pinkney, like a beetle, to the wall, in
<hi rend="italics">McCollough</hi> vs. <hi rend="italics">The State of Maryland</hi>, or made Webster“take
water” in the great Dartmouth College case. What seemed to him
“the perfection of human reason,” was not the common law, but
that part of the Statute law which
<pb n="265"/>
gave the remedy by attachment, and which statute was, as he was
fond of saying, “to be liberally construed in favor of justice and
for the prevention of fraud:” and he thought the perfection of
professional practice under the “perfection of reason,” was, to get
a skulking debtor fixed so as to give an opportunity for starting
the remedy after him, and thus securing a bad or doubtful debt out
of property which might otherwise be “secreted,” or squandered
in paying <hi rend="italics">other</hi> debts, for which the debtor might have a sickly
fancy.</p>
            <p>Squire Tee was a great favorite of Northern creditors, and
deservedly. He clung to them through thick and thin, through
good report and through bad report, in hard times and in easy
times, and through all times. He “kept his loyalty, his love, his
zeal” in a perpetual fervor. His confidence in them was
unbounded. Nothing could either increase or diminish it. He
would have sacrificed his own interest to theirs—he did, no
doubt, frequently: and the more he gave of service to their
cause—by the usual law of charity—the more he was capable of
giving—the widow's cruse of oil grew by the giving to two
widows' cruses of oil.</p>
            <p>Among other things, he practiced an intimate acquaintance
with the facts of his case. No man was more sedulous in the
preparation of proofs. He knew that however well a case was put
up on the papers, it was of but little avail if it was not also well
put up in the evidence. He liked evidence—a plenty of it, and
good what there was of it: better too much than not
enough;—he liked to converse
<pb n="266"/>
with the witnesses himself—to know exactly what they would
prove: it pleased him to hear them rehearse, and then it prepared
him for the coming on of the piece when he could act as prompter.
He was an amateur in evidence; he loved it as an antiquarian an old
fossil—as a machinist a new invention—as a politician a new
humbug; it was a thing to be admired for itself—it had both an
intrinsic and an extrinsic value. Receiving many claims when the
times were at the hardest, he found himself frequently opposed
by the ablest counsel of the State; and the incident we are to relate
of him occurred on one of those occasions.</p>
            <p>It should have been stated that, as in collecting cases, many of
the clients lived at a great distance from the debtor, the attorney
acted, in such instances, as the general agent of the creditor, to a
great extent: and, in preparing a case for trial, had to do the work
of both client and counsel. Mr. Tee was often brought into
correspondence with the debtors afterwards to be made
defendants. Opportunities afforded by such relations, it will
readily be perceived, could very easily be improved into occasions
for eliciting such facts as would, in no few instances, be very
useful evidence on the trial. In this way, Mr. Tee's research and
industry had been rewarded by a vast amount of useful
information of which his duty to his clients made him not at all
penurious, when it became their interest to have it turned into
testimony. He had a good memory, a good manner, an excellent
voice and a fine person; and he knew of no more pleasing way of
putting to account a good memory, a good
<pb n="267"/>
manner, an excellent voice and a fine person, than in delivering
testimony in open court for a Northern client. He had one
advantage over most witnesses; he knew something about the
facts before he heard the parties' statements: he paid the most
particular attention with the view of having matters definitely
fixed in his mind, and then, being a lawyer and a good judge of the
article proof, he was able to refer his statement to the proper
points, and to know the relevancy and bearing of the facts on the
case. He was fluent, easy, unembarrassed, though somewhat
earnest of manner and speech, and had a lively talent for affidavit,
elocution and a considerable power of compendious, terse and
vigorous narrative in that department of forensic eloquence. It
affords us pleasure to be able to pay this deserved meed of justice
to an old friend and associate. <hi rend="italics">Some</hi> men are niggardly of praise.
Not so this author.</p>
            <p>This marked fidelity to the interests of his clients had made
Mr. Tee somewhat familiar with the witness box, and the result
had almost universally been a speedy disposal of the matter
involved in the controversy in favor of his client.</p>
            <p>The bar, not always the most confiding of men, nor the least
querulous, had begun to find fault with this <hi rend="italics">euthanasia</hi>, as Mr. C.J.
Ingersoll, in his Bunyan-like style, expresses it: they wanted a
lawsuit to die the old way, and not by chloroform process,—the
old bull-baiting fashion—fainting off from sheer exhaustion, or
overpowered by sheer strength and lusty cuffs, kicking and
fighting to the last. And so they
<pb n="268"/>
               <hi rend="italics">complained</hi> and <hi rend="italics">averred</hi> it was to their <hi rend="italics">great damage, wherefore
they sued</hi> Tee to <hi rend="italics">discontinue proceedings</hi> of this sort, but <hi rend="italics">he
refused, and possibly, still refuses</hi>.</p>
            <p>A suit had been brought by Tee for a leading house in New-York,
in the U.S. Court, on a bill of exchange drawn or indorsed
by a merchant, and W.Y. Gee, Esq., employed to defend it. The
amount was considerable, but the case promised to be more
interesting as involving a new and difficult point in the Law
Merchant upon the question of notice.</p>
            <p>The case had been opened for the plaintiff—the bill, protest,
depositions, foreign statutes, and so forth, read, and one or two
witnesses examined. The Court had taken a recess for dinner—it
being understood or taken for granted that the plaintiff had closed
his case. The defendant either had no witnesses or else preferred
submitting the ease without them, the point on which Mr. Gee
relied having been brought out by an unnecessary question
propounded by Tee to his own witness.</p>
            <p>After the meeting of the Court, Mr. Gee, who was a little near-sighted,
was seen before the bar, leisurely arranging a small library
of books he had collected, and by the aid of which he was to argue
the point on the notice. Having accomplished this to his
satisfaction, he leaned his head on his hand and was absorbed in
profound cogitation—like an Episcopal clergyman before the
sermon. The court interrupted him in this meditation by
announcing its readiness to proceed with the cause. Gee rose and
remarked to the Court that
<pb n="269"/>
the defence was one of pure law, and he should raise the only
question he meant to make by a demurrer to the plaintiff's
evidence. “Not until the plaintiff gets through his proof, I
reckon,” said Mr. Tee. “Why, I thought you had rested,” replied
Mr. Gee. “Yes,” said Tee, “I did rest a little, and am now tired
resting, and will proceed to labor—Clerk, SWEAR ME.”</p>
            <p>Gee jumped from his seat and rushed towards Tee—“Now
Tee,” said he—“just this one time, if you please, forbear, for
Heaven's sake—come now, be reasonable—it is the prettiest
point as it stands I ever saw—the principle is really
important—don't spoil it, Tee.” But Tee, fending Gee off with
one hand, held out the other for the book. Gee grew more
earnest—“Tee, Tee, old fellow—I say now, look here, Tee, don't
do this, <hi rend="italics">this</hi> time—just hold off for a minute—come, listen to
reason—now come, come, let <hi rend="italics">this</hi> case be an exception—you <hi rend="italics">said</hi> you
were through—if you will just stand off I won't demur you out
any more.”</p>
            <p>But Tee was not to be held off—he repeated, “Clerk, swear
me, I must discharge my professional duties.”</p>
            <p>Gee retired in disgust, not waiting to hear the result—barely
remarking, that if it came to <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, Tee would cover the case like a
confession of judgment and the statute of <hi rend="italics">Jee-fails</hi> besides. We
believe he was not mistaken; for his <hi rend="italics">affidavy</hi> carried the case
sailing beyond gun-shot of Gee's batteries.</p>
            <p>Gee contented himself with giving notice to Tee that he
<pb n="270"/>
should require him for the future to give him notice when he
meant to testify in his cases, as he wished to be saved the trouble
of bringing books and papers into Court. To which Tee replied he
might consider a <hi rend="italics">general</hi> notice served upon him <hi rend="italics">then</hi>.</p>

            <head>AN EQUITABLE SET-OFF.</head>
            <p>AN enterprising young gentleman of the extensive family of
Smith, rejoicing in the Christian prefix of Theophilus, and engaged
in that species of traffic for which Kentucky is famous, to wit,
in the horse-trading line, tried his wits upon a man in the same
community of the name of Hickerson, and found himself very
considerably <hi rend="italics">minus</hi> in the operation; the horse he had swapped
turning out to be worth, by reason of sundry latent defects,
considerably less than nothing.</p>
            <p>Smith waited, for some time, for an opportunity of righting
himself in the premises; preferring to be discreetly silent on the
subject of his loss, such accidents being looked upon, about that
time, by those with whom he most associated, more as a matter of
ridicule than sympathy. At length Mr. Hickerson, in the course of
one of his trading forays in the neighboring village, had got a fine
mule, and brought him home, well pleased with his bargain. A
favorable opportunity now presented itself for Mr. Smith to
obtain his revenge. He adopted the following plan: He sent a
complaisant friend, a Mr. Timothy Diggs, over to Hickerson's one
Sunday morning,
<pb n="274"/>
with instructions. Mr. Diggs, riding leisurely beyond Mr.
Hickerson's premises, caught sight of the mule, and, turning
towards the house, saw Mr. Hickerson, who was sitting in the
porch calmly enjoying those exhilarating reflections which come
across the mind of a jockey after a good trade. “Halloo,
Hickerson,” said he, “I see you have got Jones's big mule—Jones
came near selling him to me, but I got item in time, and escaped.”
“Why,” said Hickerson, 
“was any thing the matter with the
mule?” “Yes,” said Diggs; 
“however, I don't know myself that
there was much, only this; that the mule does very well except in
the full of the moon, and then he takes fits which last about a
week, hardly ever longer; and then such rearing and charging, and
biting and kicking! he's like all possessed—nobody and nothing
can manage him. Now, the best you can do is to go down to Smith's,
and trade him off with him for a bran-new sorrel horse he's got.
“Well,” said Hickerson, “I'll do <hi rend="italics">that</hi> sure. Hold on, and keep dark,
old fellow, and see how I'll crack him.”</p>
            <p>Hickerson accordingly fixed up his mule, and rode over to Mr.
Smith's, and after much chaffering, and many mutual
compliments, in the French style, to their respective animals, the
new sorrel, that had been fixed up for Mr. Hickerson's special
benefit, and had all the diseases that horseflesh is heir to, and
some it gets by adoption, was exchanged for the mule.</p>
            <p>It was not long before Mr. Hickerson, finding Mr. Smith in
company with some of the young gentlemen who could relish
humor of this sort, ventured to relate this amusing incident;
<pb n="275"/>
but when Mr. Smith, who had quietly awaited the
termination of the narrative and the laughter growing thereout, in
his turn gave in the counter-plot, Mr. Hickerson's sensibilities
became greatly excited; and seeking to right himself by the law,
on the facts coming out, found that Mr. Smith had only obtained
an equitable set-off, and that he could not plead his own
turpitude to regain what he had lost in trying to <hi rend="italics">come</hi> the old
soldier over another man.</p>

unhung.</p>
            <p>A justice of the peace in Alabama has jurisdiction in cases of
<hi rend="italics">debt</hi>, to the extent of fifty dollars; and there are two justices for
every captain's beat. It was usual, when a case of much interest
came on, for one justice to call in the other as associate. On one
occasion, the little town of Splitskull, in -- County was thrown into
a flutter of excitement, by a suit brought by one Smith against one
Johnston, for forty dollars, due on a trade for a jackass, but
payment of which was resisted, on the plea that the jackass turned
out to be valueless. The parties—the ass excluded—were
brothers-in-law, and the “connection” very numerous; the ass, too, was
well known, and shared the usual fate of notoriety—a great deal
of good, and a somewhat greater amount of bad, repute. The issue
turned upon the worth of the jack, and his standing in the community.
<pb n="277"/>
Partisan feeling was a good deal aroused—the community
grew very much excited—several fights arose from the matter, and
it was <hi rend="italics">said</hi> that a constable's election had been decided upon the
issue of jackass <hi rend="italics">

reported that a young lady in the neighborhood had discarded a
young gentleman for the part he took in favor of the quadruped,
differing widely, as she did—no doubt honestly—on the merits of
the question, from her swain. Unfortunately, politics at that time
were raging wildly; and the name of the jack being <hi rend="italics">Dick</hi> Johnson,
and one of the parties being a whig and the other a democrat, that
disturbing element was thrown in. But it is only fair to say, that
the excitement on the actual merits of the subject, to a
considerable extent, blotted out party lines;. so that I cannot say
that the ass was seriously injured by politics—few are. This
controversy got into the church; but the church had soon to drop
it—two of the preachers having got to fisticuffs, and made
disclosures on each other, &amp;c., &amp;c., the danger being that it would
break up the congregation.</p>
            <p>It got, at length, into the lawyers' hands; and then, of course,
all hopes of a settlement of the controversy, except in one way,
were at end.</p>
            <p>After the parties employed their lawyers, the note of busy
preparation rang more loudly throughout the excitement. Forty
witnesses a side were subpoenaed. The people turned out as to a
muster. The pro-ass party, and the anti-ass party made
themselves busy in getting things ready
<pb n="278"/>
for trial. The justices preserved an air of mysterious and
dignified impartiality, and all attempts to sound them on the
question proved abortive. Little Billy Perkins, who taught a
singing school in the neighborhood, and who had many arts and
many opportunities for ingratiating himself with the wife and
daughters of Squire Crousehorn, <hi rend="italics">did get</hi>, he used afterwards to
boast, some little item, in a private way, as to the leaning of that
jurist; and, on the strength of it, laid a wager of a set of singing
books and a tuning-fork, against twenty bushels of corn, <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> the
ass: but the wary Squire Rushong, who was a bachelor, kept his
own counsel, and even kept away from all the quiltings and
shuckings, for fear his secret might be wormed out of him by
some seducing Delilah; or else, that he might, by refusing to
compromise his judicial character, compromise his matrimonial
prospects. But it <hi rend="italics">was said</hi> that the Squire was sweet on Miss
Susan Smith; and it was easy enough to see, that to take part
against the ass, in the present aspect of affairs, was the same as to
give up all hopes of Miss Susan, or, what was tantamount with
the prudent Squire—any inchoate rights or prospective interests
in her father's estate. And it <hi rend="italics">was whispered</hi> about by some of the
anti-ass party, that, considering how cold Miss Susan had been to
the Squire before, there was something suspiciously sweet in the
way she smiled on him as he helped her into the ox-wagon from
the church door, when she was about leaving for home. But I dare
say this was mere imagination. The plaintiff, Smith, was fortunate
enough to employ Tom B. Devill, an
<pb n="279"/>
old lawyer who had great experience in the courts of the county,
especially in such fancy cases as the present; and was justly
distinguished throughout all that neck of woods, for having the
most “LIBELLIOUS” tongue in all that region: while the rival faction
were thrown upon young Ned Boller, a promising disciple in the
same department of the profession; and who was considered as a
“powerful judge of law,” especially of “statue law,” but who had
not the same experience in the conduct of such important and
delicate litigation. Great was the exultation of the pro-assites,
when it was announced that their messenger—though the others
had got to the court-house first—had seen the Squire Tom B.
before their adversary; the pro-assite messenger, by sharp
foresight, having made his way straight to the grocery where Tom
was, and the other, by a strange mistake as to his whereabouts,
going to his office to find him. The pro-assites swore there was no
use in carrying the thing further—it was as good as decided
already—for “Tom B. Devill could
<hi rend="italics">shykeen</hi> and bullyrag Ned
Boller's shirt off, and give him two in the game.” Anti-ass stock
fell in the market, and there was even some feeler put out for a
“<hi rend="italics">comp</hi>.”  -
but the proposition was indignantly rejected.</p>
            <p>The canvassing of the witnesses, and preparations for trial,
played the very mischief with the harmony of the settlement. The
people had come in from one of the older Southern States, for the
most part, and were known to each other, and had been for many
years, and before they had come out:—unfortunately, being
known has its disadvantages as
<pb n="280"/>
well as advantages. Such revelations! Some had run off for debt,
some for stealing—some had done one thing, some another; and
even the women were not spared—and, of the rising
generation—but I spare these details.</p>
            <p>The plaintiff, knowing the advantage of having a persecuted
individual in view of the evidence, had brought Dick Johnson
under a <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">subpoena
duces tecum</foreign>
               </hi>, on the ground; and the groom,
Hal Piles, made him go through the motions very grandly—rearing
up—braying his loudest, and kicking up other rustics, indicating a
great flow of <hi rend="italics">animal</hi> spirits,
and great <hi rend="italics">vivacity</hi> of manners.
Accompanying all which performances, Hal's ready
witticisms—which he had picked up at his various
stands—though not remarkable for refinement, seemed to excite
no little merriment in the crowd around, well qualified to
appreciate and enjoy such rhetorical flourishes and intellectual
entertainment.</p>
            <p>The trial came on. It lasted several days. The place of the trial
was the back-room of the grocery, the crowd standing outside or
in the front-room; but this not affording space enough, it was
adjourned to the grove in front of the meeting-house; and ropes
drawn around an area in front for the lawyers, Court, and
witnesses. The case was carried through, at last, even to the
arguments of the learned barristers; but these we cannot give, as
we were not present at the trial, and might do injustice to the
eminent counsel, by reporting their speeches second-hand. It is
enough to say, that old Devill did his best, and fully sustained his
reputation; while Boller not only met the expectations of
<pb n="281"/>
his friends, but acquitted himself in the blackguarding line so
admirably, that even old Tom B. Devill asked the protection of
the Court: an appeal he had never made before.</p>
            <p>At length the case was put to the justices, and they withdrew
to consider of their judgment. They remained out, in consultation,
for a good while. The anxiety of the crowd and the parties was
intense, and kept growing, the longer they staid out. A dozen bets
were taken on the result; and fourteen fights were made up, to
take place as soon as the case was decided. At least twenty men
had deferred getting drunk, until they could hear the issue of this
great suit.</p>
            <p>The justices started to return to their places  -
and “here they
come,” being cried out, the crowd (or rather crowds scattered
about the hamlet) came rushing up from all quarters to hear the
news.</p>
            <p>Silence being ordered by the constable, you might have seen a
hundred open mouths (as if hearing were taken in at that hole)
gaping over the rope against which the crowd pressed. Justice
Crousehorn hemmed three times, and then, with a tremulous
voice, announced that the “Court ar hung,”—one and one. Now
here was a fix. What was to be done? In vain the “Digest” was
looked into; in vain “Smith's Justice” was searched. Nothing
could be found to throw light on the matter. The case had to be
tried: if decided either way, “there was abundance of authority,”
as Rushong well suggested, to show that the defeated party could
appeal: but here there was no judgment. Ned Boler
<pb n="282"/>
insisted that the defendant had really gained the case, as the
plaintiff must show himself entitled to judgment before he could
get it; and likened it to a case of failure of proof: but, on this
point, the Court divided again. Tom B. Devill argued that<hi rend="italics">the
plaintiff</hi> was entitled to judgment, as he had the justice issuing the
warrant in his favor, and the associate was only called in as vice-justice,
or, at most, as supplementary, and supernumerary, and
advisory: and likened it to the case of a President of the United
States differing from his cabinet. But here the Court divided again.</p>
            <p>The crowd outside now raised a terrible row, disputing as to
who had won the bets—the betters betting on particular side's
winning, contending that they had not lost, as such a thing as a
hung court “wasn't took into the <hi rend="italics">calcu</hi>.”—but their adversaries
claimed that the bet was to be literally construed.</p>
            <p>At length a brilliant idea struck Mr. Justice Crousehorn—
which was, that his brother Rushong should sit and give judgment
alone, and then, afterwards, that he, Crousehorn, should sit and
grant a new trial. Accordingly, this was agreed to. Justice Rushong
took the bench, and Squire Crousehorn retired. The former then
gave judgment for the plaintiff; which the crowd, not knowing the
arrangement, hearing, the pro-assites raised a deafening shout of
triumph, in which Dick Johnson joined with one of his loudest
and longest brays. But brother Crousehorn, taking the seat of
justice, speedily checked these manifestations of applause, by
announcing he had granted a new
<pb n="283"/>
trial, which caused the anti-assites to set up a counter-shout, in
which Richard also joined. So the cause was gotten back again to
where it was before, and then was continued for further
proceedings.</p>
            <p>But what was to be done with the case <hi rend="italics">now</hi>? If tried again,
the same result would happen, and there was no election of new
justices for eighteen months; the costs, in the mean time,
amounting to an enormous sum. The lawyers now got together,
and settled it. Each party was to pay his own costs—Tom B.
Devill took the jackass for his fee, and was to pay Ned Boller ten
dollars of his fee, and the forty dollar note was to be paid to the
plaintiff: an arrangement whereby the parties only lost about fifty
dollars a piece; besides the amount in controversy. But the heart-burnings
and excitement the great trial left, were incapable of compromise, and
so they remain to this day.</p>
            <p>But this trial was the making of Ned Boller. His practice
immediately rose from $75 to $350 a year. And to this day, so
strong was the effect of his speech, that when the Splitskullers
want an hyperbole to express a compliment for a speech, they
say it was “nearly equal to Ned Boller's great speech against the
jackass.”</p>

            <head>SAMUEL HELE, ESQ.</head>
            <p>I CANNOT omit Sam from my gallery of daubs. I should feel a sense
of incompleteness, grieving the conscience with a feeling of duty
undischarged and opportunities neglected, such as Cave Burton
would have felt had he risen from table with an oyster-pie
untouched before him.</p>
            <p>Of all the members of the bar, Sam cultivated most the faculty
of directness. He could tolerate nothing less than its absence in
others. He knew nothing of circumlocution. He had as soon been a
tanner's horse, and walked all his life pulled by a pole and a string,
around a box, in a twenty-foot ring, as to be mincing words,
hinting and hesitating, and picking out soft expressions. He liked
the most vigorous words; the working words of the language. He
thought with remarkable clearness; knew exactly what he was
going to say; meant exactly what he said; and said exactly what he
meant. A sea-captain with his cargo insured, would as soon have
made a “deviation” and forfeited the insurance, as Sam,
especially when in pursuit of a new idea, would have wandered
for a minute from his straight course. His sense was strong,
<pb n="285"/>
discriminating, and relevant. Swift was not more English in his
sturdy, peremptory handling of a subject, than Sam; nor more
given to varnish and mollifying. He tore the feathers off a subject,
as a wholesale cook at a restaurant does the plumage off a fowl,
when the crowd are clamorously bawling for meat. Sam was well
educated and well informed. But his memory had never taken on
more matter than his mind assimilated. He had no use for any
information that he could not work into his thought. He had a great
contempt for all prejudices except his own, and was entirely
uncramped by other people's opinions, or notions, or whims, or
fancies, or desires. The faculty of veneration was not only
wanting, but there was a hole where there ought to have been a
bump. <hi rend="italics">Prestige</hi> was a thing he didn't understand. <hi rend="italics">Family</hi> he had no
idea of, except as a means of procreation, and he would have
respected a man as much or as little, if, improving on the modern
spirit of progress, he had been hatched out in a retort by a
chemical process, as if he had descended from the Plantagenets,
with all the quarterings right, and no bar sinister. He had no
respect for old things, and not much for old persons. Established
institutions he looked into as familiarly as into a horse's mouth,
and with about as much respect for their age. He would, if he
could, have wiped out the Chancery system, or the whole body of
the common law, “the perfection of human reason,” as he would
an ink blot dropped on the paper as he was draughting a bill to
abolish them. He had no tenderness for the creeds or superstitions
of others. A man, tender-toed on the matter of favorite hobbies,
had better not be
<pb n="286"/>
in Sam's neighborhood. If he cherished any mysteries and
tenderness of belief that the strong sunlight of common sense
caused to blink in the eyes, Sam was no pleasant companion to
commune with; for Sam would drag them from the twilight as he
would an owl, into noonday, and laugh at the figure they cut in
the sunshine. A delicately-toned spiritualist felt, when Sam was
handling his brittle wares, as a fine lady would feel, on seeing a
blacksmith with smutty fingers taking out of her box, her
complexion, laces and finery.</p>
            <p>Doctor Samuel Johnson objected to some one “that there was
no salt in his talk;” he couldn't have said that of Sam's discourse.
It not only contained salt, but salt-petre: for probably, as many
vigorous, brimstone expressions proceeded from Sam's mouth, as
from any body else's, the peculiar patron of brimstone fireworks
only excepted.</p>
            <p>The faculty of the <hi rend="italics">wonderful</hi> did not hold a large place on
Sam's cranium. He believed that every thing that was marvellous
was a lie, unless he told it himself; and sometimes even then, he
had his doubts. He only wondered on one subject; and that was,
that there always happened to be about him such “a hell of a
number of d-d fools;” and this wonder was constant, deriving
new strength every day; and he wondered again at his inability to
impress this comfortable truth upon the parties whom he so
frequently, in every form and every where, and especially in their
presence, sought to make realize its force and wisdom, by every
variety of illustration; by all the eloquence of earnest
conviction and solemn asseveration.</p>
            <pb n="287"/>
            <p>If Sam had a sovereign contempt for any one more than
another, it was for Sir William Blackstone, whom he regarded as
“something between a sneak and a puke,” and for whose
superstitious veneration of the common law he felt about the
same sympathy that Gen. Jackson felt for Mr. Madison's
squeamishness on the subject of blood and carnage, which the
hero charged the statesman with not being able “to look on <hi rend="italics">with
composure</hi>”—(he might as well have said, pleasure).</p>
            <p>Squire Sam was of a good family—a circumstance he a good
deal resisted, as some infringement on his privileges. He would
have preferred to have been born at large, without any particular
maternity or paternity; it would have been less local and narrow
and more free and roomy, and cosmopolitan.</p>
            <p>There had once been good living in the family. This is evident
from the fact that Sam had the gout; which proof, indeed, except
vague traditions, which Sam rejected as unworthy of a sensible
man's belief, is the only evidence of this matter of domestic
economy. Sam thought particularly hard of this; he considered it a
monstrous outrage, that the only portion of the prosperous
fortunes of his house which fell to his share, should have been a
disease which had long survived the causes of it. As his teeth
were set on edge, he thought it only fair he should have had a few
of the grapes.</p>
            <p>Sam's estimate of human nature was not extravagant. He was
not an optimist. He had not much notion of human
<pb n="288"/>
perfectibility. He was not apt to be carried away by his feelings
into any very overcharged appreciation either of particular
individuals or the general race. I never heard him say what he
thought would eventually become of most of them; but it was
very evident, from the tenor of his unstinted talk, what he thought
<hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to become of them, if transmundane affairs were regulated
by principles of human justice.</p>
            <p>The particular community in which the Squire had set up his
shingle was not, even in the eyes of a more partial judgment than
he was in the habit of exercising upon men, ever supposed to be
colonized by the descendants of the good Samaritan; and if they
continued perverse, and persevered in iniquity, it was not Sam's
fault—he did <hi rend="italics">his</hi> duty by them. He cursed them black and blue, by
night and by day. He spared not. In these divertisements he
exercised his faculties of description, prophecy and invective,
largely. The humbugs suffered. Sam vastated them, as Swedenborg
says they do with them in the other world, until he left little but a
dark, unsavory void, in souls, supposed by their owners to be
stored up, like a warehouse, with rich bales of heavenly
merchandise. He pulled the dominos from their faces, and pelted
the hollow masks over their heads lustily. These pursuits, laudable
as they may be, are not, in the present constitution of village
society, winning ways; and therefore I cannot truly say that Sam's
popularity was universal; nor did it make up by intensity in
particular directions, what it lacked of diffusion. Indeed, I may go
so far as to say, that it was remarkable neither for surface nor
depth.</p>
            <pb n="289"/>
            <p>It is a profound truth, that the wounds of vanity are galling to
a resentful temper, and that few people feel much obliged to a man
who, purely from a love of truth, convinces the public that they
are fools or knaves; or who excites a doubt in themselves touching
the right solution of this problem of mind and morals. Hence I
may be allowed to doubt whether Sam's industry and zeal in these
exercises of his talents—whatever effect they may have had on
the community—essentially advanced this gentleman's personal or
pecuniary fortunes. However, I am inclined to think that this
result, so far from grieving, rather pleased the Squire. Having
formed his own estimate of himself, he preferred that that
estimate should stand, and not be shaken by a coincidence of
opinion on the part of those whose judgments in favor of a thing
he considered was pretty good <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">prima facie</foreign>
               </hi> evidence against it.</p>
            <p>Sam's disposition to animadvert upon the community about
him, found considerable aggravation in a state of ill health;
inflaming his gout, and putting the acerbities and horrors of
indigestion to the long account of other provocatives, of a less
physical kind, to these displays. For a while, Sam dealt in
individual instances; but this soon grew too tame and insipid for
his growing appetite; for invective is like brandy—the longer it is
indulged in, the larger and stronger must be the dose. Sam began to
take them wholesale; and he poured volley after volley into the
devoted village, until you would have thought it in a state
of siege.</p>
            <pb n="290"/>
            <p>There had, a few days before, been a new importation from
Yankeedom—not from its factory of calicoes, but from its
factory of school-teachers. The article had been sent to order, from
one of the interior villages of Connecticut. The Southern
propensity of getting every thing from abroad, had extended to
school-mistresses,—though the country had any number of
excellent and qualified girls wishing such employment at
home,—as if, as in the case of wines, the process of importing
added to the value. It was soon discovered that this article was a
bad investment, and would not suit the market. Miss Charity
Woodey was almost too old a plant to be safely transplanted.
What she had been in her youth could not be exactly known; but if
she ever had any charms, their day had long gone by. I do not
mean to flatter her when I say I think she was the ugliest woman I
ever saw—and I have been in places where saying that would be
saying a good deal. Her style of homeliness was peculiar only in
this—that it embraced all other styles. It is a wonderful
combination which makes a beautiful woman; but it was almost a
miracle, by which every thing that gives or gilds beauty was
withheld from her, and every thing that makes or aggravates
deformity was given with lavish generosity. We suppose it to be a
hard struggle when female vanity can say, hope, or think nothing
in favor of its owner's personal appearance; but Miss Charity had
got to this point: indeed, the power of human infatuation on this
subject—for even <hi rend="italics">it</hi> is not omnipotent—could not help her in this
matter. She did not try to conceal it, but let the matter pass,
<pb n="291"/>
as if it were a thing not worth the trouble of thinking about.</p>
            <p>Miss Charity was one of those “strong-minded women of
New England,” who exchange all the tenderness of the feminine
for an impotent attempt to attain the efficiency of the masculine
nature; one of that fussy, obtrusive, meddling class, who, in
trying to <hi rend="italics">double-sex</hi> themselves, <hi rend="italics">unsex</hi> themselves, losing all
that is lovable in woman, and getting most of what is odious in
man.</p>
            <p>She was a bundle of prejudices—stiff, literal, positive,
inquisitive, inquisitorial, and biliously pious. <hi rend="italics">Doo</hi>ty, as she called
it, was a great word with her. Conscience was another. These were
engaged in the police business of life, rather than the heart and the
affections. Indeed, she considered the affections as weaknesses,
and the morals a sort of drill exercise of minor duties, and
observances, and cant phrases. She was as blue as an indigo bag.
The starch, strait-laced community she came from, she thought the
very tip of the ton; and the little coterie of masculine women and
female men—with its senate of sewing societies, cent societies,
and general congress of missionary and tract societies—the
parliaments that rule the world. Lower Frothingham, and Deacon
Windy, and old Parson Beachman, and all the young Beachmans,
constituted, in her eyes, a sort of Puritanic See, before which she
thought Rome was in a state of continual fear and flutter.</p>
            <p>She had come out as a missionary of light to the children of
the South, who dwell in the darkness of Heathenesse.
<pb n="292"/>
It was not long—only two days—before she began to set
every thing to rights. The whole academy was astir with her
activity. The little girls, who had been petted by their fathers and
mothers like doll-babies, were overhauled like so much damaged
goods by her busy fingers, and were put into the straitjacket of
her narrow and precise system of manners and morals, in a way
the pretty darlings had never dreamed of before. <hi rend="italics">Her</hi> way was the
Median and Persian law that never changed, and to which every
thing must bend. Every thing was wrong. Every thing must be put
right. Her hands, eyes, and tongue were never idle for a moment,
and in her microscopic sense of <hi rend="italics">doo</hi>ty and conscience, the little
peccadilloes of the school swelled to the dimensions of great
crimes and misdemeanors.</p>
            <p>It was soon apparent that she would have to leave, or the
school be broken up. Like that great reformer Triptolemus
Yellowby, she was not scant in delivering her enlightened
sentiments upon the subject of matters and things about her, and
on the subject of slavery in particular; and her sentiments on this
subject were those of the enlightened coterie from which she came.</p>
            <p>The very consideration with which, in the unbounded
hospitality and courtesy to woman in the South-West, she was
treated, only served to inflame her self-conceit, and to confirm
her in her sense of what her <hi rend="italics">doo</hi>ty called on her to do, for the
benefit of the natives; especially to reforming things to the
standard of New England insular habitudes.</p>
            <p>A small party was given one evening, and she was invited.
<pb n="293"/>
She came. There were some fifteen or twenty persons of
both sexes there; among them our friend Sam, and a few of the
young men of the place. The shocking fact must be related, that,
on a sideboard in the back parlor was set out something cold,
besides <hi rend="italics">solid</hi> refreshments, to which the males who did not belong
to the “Sons” paid their respects. A little knot of these were
laughing and talking around Sam, who, as usual, was exerting
himself for the entertainment of the auditors, and, this time, in
good humor. Some remarks were made touching Miss Charity, for
whose solitary state—she was sitting up in the corner by herself,
stiff as steelyards—some commiseration was expressed; and it
was proposed that Sam should entertain her for the evening. And
it was suggested to Sam that he should try his best to get her off,
by giving her such a description of the country as would have that
effect. “Now,” said one of them, “Sam, you've been snarling at
every thing about you so long, suppose you just try your best this
time, and let off all your surplus bile at once, and give us some
peace. Just go up to her, and let her have it strong. Don't spare
brush or blacking, but paint the whole community so black, that
the Devil himself might sit for the picture.” Sam took a glass, and
tossing it off, wiped his mouth, after a slight sigh of satisfaction,
and promised, with pious fervor, that, “by the blessing of Heaven,
he would do his best.”</p>
            <p>One of the company went to Miss Charity and, after
speaking in the highest terms of Sam, as a New England man, and
as one of the most intellectual, and reliable, and
<pb n="294"/>
frank men in the country, and one, moreover, who had conceived
a lively regard for her, asked leave to introduce him; which
having been graciously given, Sam (having first refreshed himself
with another potation) was in due form introduced.</p>
            <p>Miss Woodey, naturally desirous of conciliating Squire Hele,
opened the conversation with that gentleman, after the customary
formalities, by saying something complimentary about the village.
“And you say, madam,” replied Sam, “that you have been
incarcerated in this village for two weeks; and how, madam, have
you endured it? Ah, madam, I am glad, on some accounts, to see
you here. You came to reform: it was well. Such examples of
female heroism are the poetry of human life. They are worth the
martyrdom of producing them. I read an affecting account the
other day of a similar kind—a mother going to Wetumpka, and
becoming the inmate of a penitentiary for the melancholy
satisfaction of waiting upon a convict son.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss Woodey</hi>.—“Why, Mr. Hele, how you talk! You are
surely jesting.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Madam, there are some subjects too awfully serious
for jest. A man had as well jest over the corruptions and fate of
Sodom and Gomorrah—though, I confess, the existence of this
place is calculated to excite a great deal of doubt of the destruction
of those cities, and has, no doubt, placed a powerful weapon in
the hands of infidelity throughout the immense region where
the infamy of the place is known.”</p>
            <pb n="295"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“Why, Mr. Hele, I have heard a very different
account of the place. Indeed, only the other evening, I heard at a
party several of the ladies say they never knew any village so
free from gossip and scandal.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“And so it is, madam. Men and women are free of
that vice. I wish it were otherwise. It would be a sign of
improvement,—as a man with fever when boils burst out on
him,—an encouraging sign. Madam, the reason why there is no
scandal here is, because there is not character enough to support
it. Reputation is not appreciated. A man without character is as
well off as a man with it. In the dark all are alike. You can't hurt a
man here by saying any thing of him; for, say what you will, it is
less than the truth, and less than he could afford to publish at the
court-house door, and be applauded for it by the crowd. Besides,
madam, every body is so busy with his own villany, that no one
has time to publish his neighbor's.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“Really, Mr. Hele, you give a poor account of
your neighbors. Are there no honest men among them?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Why,—y-e-s,—a few. The lawyers generally
acknowledge, and, as far as circumstances allow, practise, in their
<hi rend="italics">private</hi> characters, the plainer rules of morals; but, really, they are
so occupied in trying to carry out the villany of others, they
deserve no credit for it; for they have no time to do any thing on
private account. There is also <hi rend="italics">one</hi> preacher, who, I believe, when
not in liquor, recognizes a few of the rudiments of moral
obligation. Indeed, some
<pb n="296"/>
think he is not blamable for getting drunk, as he does it only in
deference to the public sentiment. I express no opinion myself,
for I think any man who has resided for ten years in these
suburbs of hell, ought modestly to decline the expression of any
opinion on any point of ethics for ever afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“But, Mr. Hele, if all this villany were going on,
there would be some open evidence of it. I have not heard of a
case of stealing since I've been here.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“No, madam; and you wouldn't, unless a stranger
came to town with something worth stealing; and perhaps not
then; for it is so common a thing that it hardly excites remark. The
natives never steal from each other—I grant them that. The reason
is plain. There are certain acquisitions which, with a certain
profession, are sacred. ‘Honor among,’ &amp;c.—you know the
proverb. Besides, the thief would be sure to be caught: ‘Set
a’—member of a certain class—you know <hi rend="italics">that</hi> proverb, too.
Moreover, all they have got they got, directly or indirectly, in that
way—if getting a thing by purchase without equivalent, or taking
it without leave is stealing, as any where else out of Christendom,
except this debatable land between the lower regions and the
outskirts of civilization, it is held to be. And to steal from one
another would be repudiating the title by which every man holds
property, and thus letting the common enemy, the true owner, in,
whom all are interested in keeping out. Madam, if New-York,
Mobile, and New Orleans were to get their own, they might
inclose the whole town, and
<pb n="297"/>
label the walls “the lost and stolen office.” When a Tennesseean
comes to this place with a load of bacon, they consider him a
prize, and divide out what he has as so much prize money. They
talk of a Kentucky hog-drover first coming in in the fall, as an
epicure speaks of the first shad of the season.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“The population seems to be intelligent and—”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi> (with Johnsonian oracularity).—“<hi rend="italics">Seems</hi>—true; but they
are not. Whether the population first took to rascality, and that
degraded their intellects, or whether they were fools, and took to it
for want of sense, is a problem which I should like to be able to
solve, if I could only find some one old enough to have known
them when they first took to stealing, or when they first began
playing the fool; but that time is beyond the oldest memory. I can
better endure ten rascals than one fool; but I am forced to endure
both in one. I see, in a recent work, a learned writer traces the
genealogy of man to the monkey tribe. I believe that this is true of
this population; for the characteristic marks of a low, apish cunning
and stealing, betray the paternity: but so low are they in all better
qualities, that, if their respectable old ancestor the rib-nosed
baboon, should be called to see them, he would exclaim, with
uplifted paws, ‘Alas, how degenerate is my breed!’ For they have
left off all the good instincts of the beast, and improved only on
his vices.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“I have heard something of violent crimes,
<pb n="298"/>
murders, and so forth, in the South-West, but I have never heard
this particular community worse spoken of—”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Madam, I acquit them of all crimes which require any
boldness in the perpetration. As to assassination, it occurs only
occasionally,—when a countryman is found drunk, or something
of the sort; and even assaults and batteries are not common. These
occur only in the family circle; such as a boy sometimes whipping
his father when the old man is intoxicated, or a man whipping his
wife when she is infirm of health: except these instances, I cannot
say, with truth, that any charge of this kind can be substantiated.
As to negroes—”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“Do tell me, Mr. Hele—how do they treat <hi rend="italics">them</hi>?
Is it as bad as they say? Do—do—they,—really,
now—”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Hele</hi>.—“ Miss W., this is a very delicate subject; and what I
tell you must be regarded as entirely confidential. Upon this
subject there is a secrecy—a chilling mystery of silence—cast,
as over the horrors and dungeons of the inquisition. The way negroes
are treated in this country would chill the soul of a New Holland
cannibal. Why, madam, it was but the other day a case occurred
over the river, on Col. Luke Gyves's plantation. Gyves had just
bought a drove of negroes, and was marking them in his pen,—a
slit in one ear and an underbit in the other was Luke's mark,—and
a large mulatto fellow was standing at the bull-ring, where the
overseer was just putting the number
<pb n="299"/>
on his back with the branding-iron, when the nigger dog seeing his
struggles, caught him by the leg, and the negro, mad with the
pain,—I don't think he did it intentionally,—seized the
branding-irons, and put out the dog's—a favorite Cuba bloodhound
—left eye. They took the negro down to the rack in the plantation
dungeon-house, and, sending for the neighbors to come into the
entertainment, made a Christmas frolic of the matter. They
rammed a powder-horn down his throat, and lighting a slow
match, went off to wait the result. When gone, Col. Gyves bet
Gen. Sam Potter one hundred and fifty dollars that the blast would
blow the top of the negro's head off; which it did. Gen. Sam
refused to pay, and the case was brought into the Circuit Court.
Our judge, who had read a good deal more of Hoyle than Coke,
decided that the bet could not be recovered, because Luke bet on
a certainty; but fined Sam a treat for the crowd for making such a
foolish wager, and adjourned court over to the grocery to enjoy it.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“Why, Mr. Hele, it is a wonder to me that the
fate of Sodom does not fall upon the country.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Why, madam, probably it would, if a single
righteous man could be found to serve the notice. However, many
think that its irredeemable wickedness has induced Heaven to
withdraw the country from its jurisdiction, and remit it to its
natural, and, at last, reversionary proprietors, the powers of hell.
It subserves, probably, a useful end, to stand as a vivid
illustration of the doctrine of total depravity.</p>
            <pb n="300"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“But, Mr. Hele,—do tell me,—do they <hi rend="italics">now</hi> part
the young children from their mothers—poor things?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>—“Why, no,—candidly,—they do <hi rend="italics">not</hi> very much, now.
The women are so sickly, from overwork and scant feeding and
clothing, that the child is worth little for the vague chance of living.
But when cotton was fifteen cents a pound, and it was cheaper to
take away the child than to take up the mother's time in attending
to it, they used to send them to town, of a Sunday, in big hamper
baskets, for sale, by the dozen. The boy I have got in my office I
got in that way—but he is the survivor of six, the rest dying in the
process of raising. There was a great feud between the planters on
this side of Sanotchie, and those on the other side, growing out of
the treatment of negro children. Those who sold them off charged
the other siders with inhumanity, in drowning theirs, like blind
puppies, in the creek; which was resented a good deal at the time,
and the accusers denounced as abolitionists. I did hear of one of
them, Judge Duck Swinger, feeding his nigger dogs on the young
varmints, as he called them; but I don't believe the story, it having
no better foundation than current report, public belief, and general
assertion.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>. (sighing).—“Oh, Mr. Hele! are they not afraid the
negroes will rise on them?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Why, y-e-s, they do occasionally, and murder a few
families,—especially in the thick settlements,—but less than
they did before the patrol got up a subscription among the
planters to contribute a negro or two apiece, every month
<pb n="301"/>
or so, to be publicly hung, or burned, for the sake of example.
And, to illustrate the character of the population, let me just tell
you how Capt. Sam Hanson did at the last hanging. Instead of
throwing in one of his own negroes, as an honest ruffian would
have done, he threw in yellow Tom, a free negro; another threw in
an estate negro, and reported him dead in the inventory; while
Squire Bill Measly painted an Indian black and threw him in, and
hung him for one of his Pocahontas negroes, as he called some of
his half-breed stock.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“Mr. Hele! what is to become of the rising
Generation—the poor children—I do feel so much for them
—with such examples?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Madam, they are past praying for—there is one
consolation. Let what will become of them, they will get less than
their deserts. Why, madam, such precocious villany as theirs the
world has never seen before: they make their own fathers ashamed
of even <hi rend="italics">their</hi> attainments and proficiency in mendacity; they had
good teaching, though. Why, Miss Woodey, a father here never
thinks well of a child until the boy cheats him at cards: then he
pats him on the head, and says, ‘Well done, Tommy, here's a V.;
go, buck it off on a horse-race next Sunday, and we'll go snooks—
and, come, settle fair, and no cheating around the board.’ The
children here at twelve years have progressed in villany beyond
the point at which men get, in other countries, after a life of
industrious rascality. They spent their rainy Sundays, last fall,
in making a catechism of oaths and profanity
<pb n="302"/>
for the Indians, whose dialect was wanting in those
accomplishments of Anglo-Saxon literature. There is not a
scoundrel among them that is not ripe for the gallows at fourteen.
At five years of age, they follow their fathers around to the
dram-shops, and get drunk on the heel-taps.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“The persons about here don't look as if they
were drunk.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“Why, madam, it is refreshing to hear you talk in that
way. No, they are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> drunk. I wish they were. It would be an
astonishing improvement, if dissipation would only recede to that
point at which men get drunk. But they have passed that point,
long ago. I should as soon expect to see a demijohn stagger as one
of them. Besides, the liquor is all watered, and it would require
more than a man could hold to make him drunk: but the grocery
keeper defends himself on the ground, that it is only two parts
water, and he never gets paid for more than a third he sells. But I
never speak of these small things; for, in such a godless generation,
venial crimes stand in the light of flaming virtues. Indeed, we
always feel relieved when we see one of them dead drunk, for then
we feel assured he is not stealing.”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Miss W</hi>.—“But, Mr. Hele, is there personal danger to be
apprehended—by a woman?—now—for instance—expressing
herself freely?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Sam</hi>.—“No, madam, not if she carries her pistols, as they
generally do <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, when they go out. They are usually insulted,
and sometimes mobbed. They mobbed a Yankee
<pb n="303"/>
school mistress here, some time ago, for saying something
against slavery; but I believe they only tarred and feathered her,
and rode her on a rail for a few squares. Indeed, I heard some of
the boys at the grocery, the other night, talk of trying the same
experiment on another; but <hi rend="italics">who</hi> it was, I did not hear them say.”</p>
            <p>Here Sam made his bow and departed, and, over a plate of
oysters and a glass of hot stuff, reported progress to the meeting
whose committee he was, but declined leave to sit again.</p>
            <p>The next morning's mail-stage contained two trunks and four
bandboxes, and a Yankee school-mistress, ticketed on the
Northern line; and, in the hurry of departure, a letter, addressed to
Mrs. Harriet S-, was found, containing some interesting
memoranda and statistics on the subject of slavery and its
practical workings, which I should never thought of again had I
not seen something like them in a very popular fiction, or rather
book of fictions, in which the slaveholders are handled with
something less than feminine delicacy and something more than
masculine unfairness.</p>
            <p>[Sam takes the credit of sending Miss Charity off, but Dr. B.,
the principal, negatives this: he says he had to give her three
hundred dollars and pay her expenses back to get rid of her; and
that she received it, saying she intended to return home and live at
ease, the balance of her life, on the interest of the money.]</p>

            <head>JOHN STOUT ESQ., AND MARK
SULLIVAN.</head>
            <p>MARK Sullivan was imprisoned in the Sumter county
jail, having changed the venue and place of residence from
Washington county, where he had committed a murder.
John Stout was an old acquaintance of Mark's, and being of
a susceptible nature when there was any likelihood of a fee,
was not a man to stand on ceremony or the etiquette of the
profession. He did not wait to be sent for, but usually hurried
post-haste to comfort his friends, when in the
disconsolate circumstances of the unfortunate Mark. John
had a great love for the profession, and a remarkable
perseverance under discouraging circumstances, having clung to
the bar after being at least twice stricken from the roll, for
some practices indicating a much greater zeal for his clients
than for truth, justice, or fair dealing: but he had managed
to get reinstated on promises of amendment, which were, we
fear, much more profuse than sincere. John's standard of
morality was not exalted, nor were his attainments in the
profession great; having confined himself mostly to a class
<pb n="305"/>
of cases and of clients better suited to give notoriety than
enviable reputation to the practitioner. He seemed to have a
separate instinct, like a carrion crow's, for the filthy; and he
snuffed up a tainted atmosphere, as Swedenborg says <hi rend="italics">certain</hi> spirits
do, with a rare relish. But with all John's industry and enterprise,
John never throve, but at fifty years of age, he was as seedy and
threadbare in clothes as in character. He had no settled abode, but
was a sort of Calmuc Tartar of the Law, and roamed over the
country generally, stirring up contention and breeding dirty
lawsuits, fishing up fraudulent papers, and hunting up
complaisant witnesses to very apocryphal facts.</p>
            <p>Well, on one bright May morning, Squire Stout presented
himself at the door of the jail in Livingston, and asked admittance,
professing a desire to see Mr. Mark Sullivan, an old friend.
Harvey Thompson, the then sheriff, admitted him to the door
within, and which stood between Mark and the passage. John
desired to be led into the room in which Mark was, wishing, he
said, to hold a private interview with Mark as one of Mark's
counsel; but Harvey peremptorily refused—telling him,
however, that he might talk with the prisoner in his presence. The
door being thrown back, left nothing but the iron lattice-work
between the friends, and Mark, dragging his chain along, came to
the door. At first, he did not seem to recognize John; but John,
running his hand through the interstices, grasped Mark's with
fervor, asking him, at the same time, if it were possible that he had
forgotten his old friend, John Stout.
<pb n="306"/>
Mark, as most men in durance, was not slow to recognize any
friendship, real or imaginary, that might be made to turn out to
advantage, and, of course, allowed the claim, and expressed the
pleasure it gave him to see John. John soon got his <hi rend="italics">hydraulics</hi> in
readiness,—for sympathy and pathetic eloquence are wonderfully
cheap accessories to rascality,—and begun applying his
handkerchief to his eyes with great energy. “Mark, my
old friend, you and I have been friends many a
long year, old fellow; we have played many a game of seven up
together, Mark, and shot at many a shooting match, Mark, and
drunk many a gallon of ‘redeye’ together;—and to think, Mark,
my old friend and companion, that I loved and trusted like a
brother, Mark, should be in this dreadful fix,—far from wife,
children, and friends, Mark,—it makes a child of me, and I
can't—control—my feelings.” (Here John wept with
considerable vivacity, and doubled up an old bandanna
handkerchief and mopped his eyes mightily.) Mark was not one
of the crying sort. He was a Roman-nosed, eagle-eyed ruffian of a
fellow, some six feet two inches high, and with a look and step
that the McGregor himself might feel entitled him to be respected
on the heather.</p>
            <p>So Mark responded to this lachrymal ebullition of Stout's a
little impatiently: “Hoot, man, what are you making all that <hi rend="italics">how-de-do</hi>
for? It sent so bad as you let on. To be sure, it sent as
pleasant as sitting on a log by a camp fire, with a tickler of the
reverend stuff, a pack of the documents and two or three good
fellows, and a good piece of fat deer meat roasting
<pb n="307"/>
at the end of a ramrod; but, for all that, it aint so bad as might
be: they can't do nothing with me: it was done fair,—it was an old
quarrel. We settled it in the old way: I had my rifle, and I plugged
him fust—he might a knowed I would. It was devil take the
hindmost. It wasn't my fault he didn't draw trigger fust—they
can't hurt me for it. But I hate to be stayin' here so long, and the
fishin' time comin' on, too—it's mighty hard, but it can't be
holped, I suppose.” (And here Mark heaved a slight sigh.)</p>
            <p>“Ah, Mark,” said John, “I aint so certain about that; that is,
unless you are particular well defended. You see, Mark, it aint
now like it used to be in the good old times. They are getting new
notions now-a-days. Since the penitentiary has been built, they
are got quare ways of doing things,—they are sending gentlemen
there reg'lar as pigtracks. I believe they do it just because they've
got an idea it helps to pay taxes. When it used to be neck or
nothin', why, one of the young hands could clear a man; but now
it takes the best sort of testimony, and the smartest sort of
lawyers in the market, to get a friend clear. The way things are
goin' on now, murdering a man will be no better than stealin' a
nigger, after a while.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” said Mark., “things is going downwards,—there aint
no denyin' of that. I know'd the time in old Washington, when
people let gentle<hi rend="italics">men</hi> settle these here little matters their own
way, and nobody interfered, but minded their own business. And
now you can't put an inch or two of knife in a fellow, or lam
him over the head a few times with
<pb n="308"/>
a light-wood knot, but every little lackey must poke his nose into
it, and <hi rend="italics">Law, law, law</hi>, is the word,—the cowardly, nasty slinks; and
then them lawyers must have their jaw in it, and bow, bow wow, it
goes; and the ju<hi rend="italics">ror</hi>, they must have their say so in it; and the
sher<hi rend="italics">rer</hi>, he must do something, too; and the old cuss that grinds out
the law to 'em in the box, he must have his <hi rend="italics">how-de-do</hi> about it; and
then the witnesses, they must swear to ther packs of lies—and the
lawyers git to bawlin' and bellerin', like Methodist preachers at a
camp meetin'—allers quarrellin' and no fightin'—jawin' and jawin'
back, and sick eternal lyin'—I tell you, Stout, I won't stay in no
such country. When I get out of here, I mean to go to Texas, whar a
man can see some peace, and not be interfered with in his private
consarns. All this come about consekens so many new settlers
comin' in the settle<hi rend="italics">ment</hi>, bringin' their new-fool ways with 'em. The
fust of it was two preachers comin' along. I told 'em 'twould never
do—and if my advice had been tuk, the thing could a been stopped
in time; but the boys said they wanted to hear the news them
fellers fotch'd about the Gospel and sich—and there was old
Ramsouser's mill-pond so handy, too!—but it's too late now. And
then the doggery-keepers got to sellin' licker by the drink, instead
of the half-pint, and a dime a drink at that; and then the Devil was
to pay and NO <hi rend="italics">mis</hi>take. But they cant hurt me, John. They'll have
to let me out: and ef it wasn't so cussed mean, I'd take the law on
'em, and sue 'em for damages; but then it would be throw'd up to
my children, that Mark Sullivan tuk
<pb n="309"/>
the law on a man; and, besides, Stout, I've got another way of
settlin' the thing up,—in the old way,—ef my life is spared, and
Providence favors me. But that sent nothin' to the present
purpose. John, where do you live now?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">John</hi>.—“I'm living in Jackson, Mississippi, now, Mark; and
hearing you were in distress, I let go all holds, and came to see
you. Says I, my old friend Mark Sullivan is in trouble, and I must
go and see him out; and says my wife: ‘John Stout, you pretend
you never deserted a friend, and here you are, and your old friend
Mark Sullivan, that you thought so much of, laying in jail, when
you, if any man could, can get him clear.’ Now, Mark, I couldn't
stand that. When my wife throw'd that up to me, I jist had my
horse got out, and travelled on, hardly stopping day or night, till I
got here. And the U.S. Court was in session, too, and a big lawsuit
was coming on for a million of dollars. I and Prentiss and George
Yerger was for the plaintiff, and we were to get five thousand
dollars, certain, and a hundred thousand dollars if we gained it. I
went to see George, before I left, and George said I must stay—it
would never do. Says he, ‘John,’—he used always to call me
John,—‘you know,’—which I did, Mark,—<corr>‘</corr>that our client relies <hi rend="italics">on
you</hi>, and you must be here at the trial. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> can fix up the papers, and
Prent. can do the fancy work to the jury; but when it comes to the
heavy licks of the law, John, you are the man, and <hi rend="italics">no mis</hi>take.’
And just then Prentiss come in, and, after putting his arm and
sorter hugging me to him,—which was Prent's way with his
intimate friends,—says, ‘John, my old
<pb n="310"/>
friend, you have to follow on our side, and you must mash Sam
Boyd and Jo Holt into Scotch snuff; and you'll do it, too, John: and
after gaining the case, we'll have a frolic that will suck the sweet out
of the time of day.’ And then Yerger up and tells Prentiss about my
going off; and Prentiss opened his eyes, and asked me if I was
crazy; and I told him jist this: says I, ‘Prent, you are a
magnanimous man, that loves his friend, aint you?’ and Prentiss
said he hoped he was. And then said I, ‘Prentiss, Mark Sullivan is
<hi rend="italics">my</hi> friend, and in jail, away from his wife and children, and nobody
to get him out of that scrape; and may be, if I don't go and defend
him—there is no knowing what may come of it; and how could I
ever survive to think a friend of mine had come to harm for want of
my going to him in the dark, dismal time of his distress.’ (Here John
took out the handkerchief again, and began weeping, after a fashion
Mr. Alfred Jingle might have envied, even when performing for
the benefit of Mr. Samuel Weller.) ‘No,’ said I, ‘Sergeant Prentiss,
let the case go to h-l, for me;—John Stout and Andrew Jackson
never deserted a friend, and never will.’ Said Prentiss, ‘John, I
admire your principles; give us your hand, old fellow; and come, let
us take a drink;’—for Prent. was always in the habit of treating his
noble sentiments—George wasn't. Well, Mark, you see I came, and
am at your service through thick and thin.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” said Mark, “I'm much obleeged to you, John, but I'm
afeered I can't afford to have you,—you're too dear an article for
my pocket; besides, I've got old John Gayle, and I reckon
he'll do.”</p>
            <pb n="311"/>
            <p>“Why,” said John, “I don't dispute, Mark, but that the old
Governor <hi rend="italics">is</hi> some punkins,—you might have done worse. I'll not
disparage any of my brethren. I'll say to his back what I've said to
his face. You might do worse than get old John—but, Mark, two
heads are better than one; and though I may say it, when it comes
to the genius licks of the law in these big cases, it sent every man
in your fix can get such counsel. Now, Mark, money is money,
and feelins is feelins; and I don't care if I do lose the case at
Jackson. If you will only secure two hundred dollars to pay
expenses, I am your man, and you're as good as cleared already.”</p>
            <p>But Mark couldn't or wouldn't come into these reasonable
terms, and his friend Stout left him in no very amiable
mood,—having quite recovered from the fit of hysterics into
which he had fallen,—and Mark turned to Thompson, and making
sundry gyrations with his fingers upon a base formed by his nose,
his right thumb resting thereon, seemed to intimate that John
Stout's proposition and himself were little short of a humbug,
which couldn't win.</p>
            <p>Mark, though ably and eloquently defended, was convicted at
the next court, and was sentenced to the penitentiary for life.
And Stout, speaking of the result afterwards, said he did not
wonder at it, for the old rascal, after having sent for him all the
way from Jackson, higgled with him on a fee of one thousand
dollars, when he, in indignant disgust at his meanness, left
him to his fate.</p>

         <div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <head>MR. ONSLOW.</head>
            <p>IT is amusing to witness the excitement of the lawyers
concerned in the trial of a long and severely-contested case, after
the argument is concluded, and the judge is giving the jury charges
as to the law. In Mississippi, the practice is for the counsel to
prepare written charges after the case is argued, to be offered
when the jury are about retiring from the box; and the Court gives
or refuses them as it approves or disapproves of
them,—sometimes altering them to suit its own views of the law.</p>
            <p>On one occasion, a case was tried of some difficulty and
complexity, involving the title to a negro, which had been run off
from a distant part of the State, and sold in Noxubee county by a
man, who had, previously to running him, mortgaged him to the
plaintiff. The negro had been in the county for a good while
before he was discovered; and the present holder had been
sued—Mr. Onslow being the attorney for the mortgagee, and
indeed it was understood, having some other rights in the
litigation than those of counsel. The defendant had retained
Henry G-y and James T.
<pb n="313"/>
H- , Esqrs., ingenious youth, who were duly and fully prepared,
and especially willing, to exhaust all the law there was, and a
good deal there wasn't, to defeat the plaintiff's recovery in the
premises.</p>
            <p>Mr. Onslow appeared alone. Indeed, he would have scorned
assistance in such a proceeding. He had come on horseback from
the Mississippi Swamp, on no other business than to attend to
this case. His preparation was arduous and thorough—his zeal
apostolic. No doubt he had made the pine-trees sweat rezinous
tears, “voiding their rheum,” and had made the very stumps ache,
and the leaves quiver, as he journeyed on, rehearsing the great
speech he intended to make in the to-be celebrated case of
Hugginson <hi rend="italics">vs</hi>. McLeod. He was a peculiar-looking man, was Mr.
Onslow. Rising six feet in his stockings, large-boned, angular,
muscular, without an ounce of surplus flesh, he was as active
and as full of energy as a panther. His head was long and large,
the features irregular and strongly-marked, face florid, eyes black,
restless and glaring, mouth like a wolf-trap, and muscles twitching
and shaking like a bowl of jelly, and hair a reddish-brown—about
as much of it as Absalom carried, but of such independence of
carriage that it stuck up all around, “like quills upon the fretful
porcupine.” He was a sort of walking galvanic battery; charged
full in every fibre with the electric current. If a man had run his
hand over his hair in a dark room across the grain, the sparks
would have risen as from the back of a black cat. We have not
heard from him since the spiritual rappings, table tippings,
<pb n="314"/>
and movings were the vogue,—but we will go our old hat
against a julep, that if the spirits would not come at his bidding,
they have quit coming from the vasty deep, or closed business,
Mr. N.P. Tallmadge, or any other medium to the contrary
notwithstanding: and if he couldn't set a table going by the odic
force, the whole thing is a proved humbug. He was a speaker of
decided power,—indeed of tremendous power. When he spoke,
he spoke in earnest. He went it with a most vigorous <hi rend="italics">vim</hi>. He had
taken a cataract and hurricane for his model. Such a
bellowing,—such a fiery fury, of fuss and noise, would sink into
a modest silence a whole caravan of howling dervishes. Jemmy T.
thought he could be heard when he let himself out two miles: I
think this extravagant,—I should think not more than a mile and a
half. When he drew in a long breath, and bore his weight on his
voice, the very rafters seemed to move: but his voice was not all.
He grew as rampant as a wolf in high oats,—jumping up, rearing
around, and squatting low, and sidling about—forwards,
backwards—beating benches—knocking the entrails out of
law-books—running over chairs, and clearing out the area for ten feet
around him, whirling about like a horse with the blind staggers;
while he quivered all over like a galvanized frog. He usually let off
as much caloric as would have fed the lungs of the Ericsson.</p>
            <p>Innumerable were the points and half-points made during the
progress of the case, and Onslow was fortunate enough to win on
most of these. At every ruling that was made in his favor, he
would suck in his breath with a long inspiration,
<pb n="315"/>
smile a spasmodic smile of grisly satisfaction, and smack his
lips. He was in high feather, and on excellent terms with the
judge, whose rulings he would indorse with marked <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">empressement</foreign>
               </hi>.</p>
            <p>After he had bellowed his last, he took his seat; and the judge
asked the counsel if they desired any charges.</p>
            <p>Onslow rose, and told the Court he had a few. He drew out of
his hat about six pages of foolscap, on which was written twenty-two
charges, elaborately drawn out,—some of them long enough
to have been divided into chapters,—and the whole might have
been modified and indexed to advantage. The defendant's counsel,
while Onslow was reading his charges, sent up to the bench a
single instruction couched in a few words.</p>
            <p>Onslow read his charge 1. in a loud and argumentative
voice—the Court gave it: “Exactly, your honor,” observed O.,
and so on to the 22d, which was also given, Onslow bowing and
smiling, and his face glowing out, from anxiety to assurance, as
the charge was read and given, like a lightning-bug's tail, giving light
out of darkness.</p>
            <p>After he got through reading the charges, he handed them to
the judge. Hon. H. S. B. was on the bench—one of the best judges
in the State. He turned to the jury: “Gentlemen,” said he, “listen
to the instructions the Court gives you in this case.”</p>
            <p>He then read the first instruction of Onslow, in a clear,
decided tone; at the conclusion of it O. sighed heavily,—so with
the next, and so on; Onslow all this time gazing
<pb n="316"/>
with rapt attention upon the judge, and his mouth motioning
with the judge's—like a schoolboy writing O's in his
first copy—and at the end of every charge ejaculating,
“Exactly, your honor!”</p>
            <p>After getting through these charges, the judge remarked:
“And now, gentlemen, I give you this charge for the defendant.”
Onslow stopped breathing, as the judge slowly syllabled
out, “But notwithstanding—all—this—it being—an
admitted—fact—that—the mortgage—was—not—recorded
—in—Noxu—bee—county—you—must—fi—n—
d for the d—e—fen—dant.” As this was going on, Onslow
was completely psychologized: he stared until his eyes looked as if
they would pop out—his lower jaw dropped—and putting
his hand to his head, involuntarily exclaimed—“Oh, hell!
your honor!”</p>
            <p>He left in the course of ten minutes, to start on a return
journey of three hundred miles, in mid-winter, and <hi rend="italics">such</hi>
roads—through the woods to the Mississippi Swamp.—
“<hi rend="italics">Phansy</hi> his <hi rend="italics">phelinks</hi>.”</p>

            <p>JUDGE STARLING, of Mississippi, had become very sensitive
because the lawyers insisted on arguing points after he
had decided them. So he determined to put a stop to it. But
Jo. Heyfron, an excellent lawyer, who had every thing of
<pb n="317"/>
the Emerald Isle about him, but its greenness,—was the
wrong one for the decisive judicial experiment to be
commenced on. Jo. knew too much law, and the judge too
little, for an equality of advantages. On the occasion
refered to, just as the judge had pronounced a very peremptory
and a very ridiculous decision, Jo. got up in his deprecating
way, with a book in his hand, and was about to speak,
when the Judge thundered out, “Mr. Heyfron! you have
been practising, sir, before <hi rend="italics">this</hi> Court long enough to know
that when <hi rend="italics">this</hi> Court has once decided a question, the propriety
of its decision can only be reviewed in the High
Court of Errors &amp; Appeals! Take your seat, sir!”</p>
            <p>“If your honor plase!” broke out Jo., 
in a manner
that would have passed for the most beseeching, if a sly
twinkle in the off corner of his eye had not betokened the
contrary,—“If your honor plase! far be it from <hi rend="italics">me</hi> to
impugn in the slightest degray, the wusdom and proprietay of
your honor's decision! I merely designed to rade a few
lines from the volume I hold in my hand, that your honor
might persave how profoundly aignorant Sir Wulliam Blockstone
was upon this subject.”</p>
            <p>The judge looked daggers, but spoke none; and Heyfron
sat down, immortal. His body is dead, but he still
lives, for his brilliant retort, in the anecdotal reminiscences
of the South-Western bar. The anecdote has already (in a

            <head>OLD UNCLE JOHN OLIVE.</head>
            <p>ATTENDING the Kemper Court one day, and engaged in a cause
then going on, and which the adverse counsel was arguing to the
jury (something in the nature of a suit for trespass for suing out
execution and levying it on some corn reserved under the poor
debtor's law), I saw this venerable old father in Israel playing
bo-peep over the railing behind the bar, and giving me sundry winks
and beckonings to come to him.</p>
            <p>Uncle John was a gentleman of the old school, if, indeed, he
was not before there was any school. He was some seventy or
seventy-five years old, perhaps a little older. His physique was
remarkable. He looked more like an antediluvian boy than a man.
He was some four feet and a half or five feet high, rather large for
that height, and tapering off with a pair of legs marking Hogarth's
line of beauty,—an elegant curve, something on the style of apair
of pot hooks. His beard and hair were grizzly gray, and the face
oval, with a high front in the region of benevolence; but which, I
believe, no one ever knew the sense of being placed there:
<pb n="319"/>
for all of Uncle John's benefactions together, would not have
amounted to a supper of bones for a hungry dog. Uncle John's
eyes were black or black-ish, with sanguine trimmings, as if lined
by red fereting. He had a voice with a double wabble—and,
especially when he tried it on the vowels, he ran up some curious
notes on the gamut, and eked out the sound with a very useless
expenditure of accent. Uncle John Olive belonged to the Baptist
Church,—hard-shell division, but took it with the privilege: he
had a thirst like the prairies in the dog-days, and it took nearly as
much of the liquid to refresh it. But much as Uncle John loved the
ardent restoratives, he loved money quite as well; and there was a
continual warfare going on in Uncle John's breast between these
aspiring rivals: but this led to a compromise. Uncle John treated
both with equal impartiality: he drank very freely, but drank very
cheap liquors, making up for any lack of quality, by no economy
of quantity.</p>
            <p>Uncle John's scheme of life was simple. It was but a slight
improvement on Indian modes. He lived out in the woods, in a
hut which an English nobleman would have considered poor
quarters for his dogs. The furniture was in keeping, and his table
was in keeping with the furniture. His whole establishment would
probably have brought fifteen dollars. The entire civil list of the
old gentleman could not have cost seventy-five dollars to answer
its demands. He had no white person in his family except
himself—and about fifteen negroes, of all sorts and sizes. He
worked some six or seven hands, but being of a slow turn,
<pb n="320"/>
and very old-fogyish in his notions, he did not succeed very well
with them, either in governing them or making much of a crop:
about a bale to the hand was the extent to which Uncle John ever
went, even in the best seasons. But as he spent nothing except for
some articles of the last necessity, he managed to lay up every year
some few dollars, which he kept in specie, hid in a hole under a plank
of the floor, in an old chest. This close economy and saving way of
life, kept up for about fifty-five years, had at length made old Uncle
John Olive worth some ten thousand dollars. He had made it wholly
by parsimony. He was habitually and without exception the closest
man I ever saw,—as close as the bark is to a tree, or as green is to a
leaf.</p>
            <p>He was dressed in home-made linsey, and as he went
gandering it along, you would take him for the survivor of those
Dutchmen whom Irving tells of, rolling the ninepins down the
cave in the Kaatskill Mountains, when Rip Van Winkle went to
see them; except that Uncle John did not carry the keg of spirits
on his shoulder,—but generally in his belly.</p>
            <p>A circle of a mile drawn around Uncle John would have
embraced all he knew and more than he knew of this breathing
world, its ways and works, and plan and order; except what he
got item of at the market-town or at the courthouse. All beyond
that circle was mystery. Uncle John was a silent man,—he used
his tongue for little except to taste his liquor,—and his eyes and
ears were open always, though I suspect there must have been
some stoppage in the
<pb n="321"/>
way to the brain: for the more Uncle John heard and observed,
the more he seemed not to know about matters seen and
heard. But a more faithful attention I never heard of. Uncle John
was in the habit of attending court, and gave his special attention
to the matters there carried on: the way he would listen to an
argument on a demurrer or an abstract point of law, might be a
lesson and example to the most patient Dutch commentator. He
would stare with a gaze of rapt attention upon the Court and
Counsel, occasionally shifting one leg, and uttering a slight sigh
as some one of them closed the argument; and stretching his head
forward, and putting his hand behind his ear to catch the sound as
the Court suggested something, though he never understood a
single word of what was going on. Towards the end of a long
discussion, Uncle John would begin to flag a little, wiping the
perspiration from his brow, as if the exercise of listening were
very fatiguing—as, indeed, in not a few instances, it might well
have been.</p>
            <p>On the occasion referred to in the opening, Uncle John called
me, and after the salutations, told me he wanted to see me right
then on business of importance. I should have said before that I
had had some business of Uncle John's in hand, which I
discharged entirely to his satisfaction; not charging the venerable
old gentleman any thing, but getting my fee out of another person
through whose agency the old man had got into the difficulty.
This being Uncle John's first and only lawsuit, though the matter
was very simple, gave him a high opinion of my professional
abilities.
<pb n="322"/>
Indeed, next to his man Remus Simpson, the “foreman of the
crap,” whom he was in the habit of consulting on “difficult
pints,” I stood higher with Uncle John than any one else as “a
r<hi rend="italics">aa</hi>l judgmatical man.” I hope I state the fact with a feeling of
becoming modesty. In the way of law, Uncle John evidently
thought the law would be behaving itself very badly, if it did not
go the way, I wished it; and looked to my opinion not so much as
to what the law was, as what it was to be after I spoke the word.</p>
            <p>I told Uncle John Olive that I was a good deal pressed for time
just at that moment, as a case was going on in which I was
concerned; but as it was he, Uncle John, I would spare him a few
moments. And so I left Duncan to harangue the jury until I could
confer with the old man, and took him into the vacant jury-room
on the same floor, and shut the door. “Well,” said I, “Uncle John,
I hope nothing serious has happened—[which was a lie, for I was,
in the then (and I might lay the fact with a <hi rend="italics">continuando</hi>)
depressed state of my fiscality,—I confess I was a little anxious
for something to happen in order to relieve the same, and was just
doing a little mental arithmetic; figuring up what I should charge
the old man, whether a fifty or a hundred; but concluding to take
the fifty, rather than hazard the chance of bluffing the old man
off.]</p>
            <p>“But,” said the old man, “they is, <hi rend="italics">I</hi> tell you. <hi rend="italics">B-a-a</hi>-A-W-ling
—Bawling, Virgil <hi rend="italics">C-a</hi>-A-A-n-non won't do to tie to no way
you can fix it—Bawling.”</p>
            <p>“Why,” said I, “Uncle John, I must confess the conduct of
that young man has not altogether—(here the sheriff
<pb n="323"/>
called me at the door) but Uncle John, quick I'm called—”
“Well, Bawling, I reckon it don't make much odds about your going
back—you've told that <hi rend="italics">juror</hi> what they must do wonce, and I
reckon they wont ha' a furgot it by this time, Bawling.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,—but they are obstinate <hi rend="italics">sometimes</hi>, Uncle John, and I
must go—quick now—Uncle John—You say Cannon did—
what to you.”</p>
            <p>“Why, Bawling—Virgil Cannon—he had been a whippin' my
nigger, Remus—Remus told me so hisself, and I kin prove it by
Remus and sore-legged Jim—jest 'cause Remus sassed him—
when he sassed Remus fust—when he, Virgil Cannon, should
have said, as Remus heerd, that Virgil Cannon should ov said
Remus stole his corn—I went to see Virgil Cannon, and ‘Virgil
Cannon,’ says I,—jest in them words I said it, Bawling; ‘you
nasty, stinking villain, what did you whip my nigger, Remus, fur?’
And what you think Bawling, Virgil Cannon should have said?”
(here was a long emphatic stony stare.) “Why I don't know,
Uncle John,” replied I. “Why, Bawling, Virgil Cannon should ov
said to me, says he, ‘Go to h-ll, you d-d old bow-legged
puppy, and kiss my foot’—Now, Bawling, what would you
advise me to do, Bawling?”</p>
            <p>“Well,” said I, “old man, <hi rend="italics">I</hi> would advise you <hi>not</hi> to do it.
Good-bye, I must go.” And I left the old fellow stiff as a pillar
staring at the place which I left.</p>
            <p>I don't know how long he remained there—for I pitched into
the case, and the way I made the fire fly from parties, witnesses
and counsel, in the corn case, was curious.</p>

            <head>EXAMINING A CANDIDATE FOR
LICENSE.</head>
            <p>SOME time in the year of Grace, 1837 or 8, during the session
of the Circuit Court of N* * * * * * Mississippi, Mr.
Thomas Jefferson Knowly made known to his honor, his
(K.'s) respectful desire to be turned into a lawyer. Such
requests, at that time, were granted pretty much as a matter of
course. Practising law, like shinplaster banking or a fight,
was pretty much a free thing; but the statute required a certain
formula to be gone through, which was an examination
of the candidate by the Court, or under its direction. The
Judge appointed Henry G * * * and myself to put him
through, a task we undertook with much pleasure. Jefferson,
or Jeff, as he was called for short, had been lounging
about the court-house for some time, refreshing his mind with
such information as he could thus pick up on the trial of cases,
and from the discussions of the bar in reference to the laws
of his country. Having failed in the drygoods line at the
cross-roads, he was left at leisure to pursue some other calling
<pb n="325"/>
without being disturbed by any attention to his bill-book. He
had taken up a favorable opinion of the law from the glimpses he
had got of its physiognomy; and, having borrowed an old copy of
Blackstone, went to work to master its contents as well as he
could. He had reached about thirty-five years when this
hallucination struck him. He was a stout, heavy fellow—with a
head that Spurzheim might have envied: though the contents
thereof did not give any new proof of Spurzheim's theory. He was not
encumbered with any learning. He had all the apartments of his memory
unfilled and waiting to be stored with law. An owl-like gravity sat
on him with a solemnity like the picture of sorrowing affection on a
tombstone. He was just such a man as passes for a wonderful
judge of law among the rustics—who usually mistake the silent
blank of stupidity for the gravity of wisdom.</p>
            <p>We took Jefferson with us, in the recess of court, over to a
place of departed spirits,—don't start, reader! we mean, an
evacuated doggery, grocery or juicery, as, in the elegant
nomenclature of the natives, it was variously called; the former
occupant having suddenly decamped just before court, by reason
of some apprehensions of being held responsible for practicing <hi rend="italics">his</hi>
profession without license.</p>
            <p>Having taken our seats, the examiners on the counter, and the
examinee on an empty whiskey barrel, the examination began.
My learned associate having been better grounded in the elemental
learning of the books, into which his research was, as old H. used
to say, “specially sarching,”
<pb n="326"/>
and being, besides, the State's attorney, was entitled to
precedence in the examination; a claim I was very willing
to allow. After some general questions, G. asked:</p>
            <p>“Mr. Knowly, what is a <hi rend="italics">chose in action</hi>?”</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Knowly</hi>.—A chosen action? eh?—yes—exactly—just so
—a chosen action? Why, a chosen action is—where a man's got a
right to fetch two or three actions and he chuses one of 'em which
he will fetch—the one that's chuse is the—chosen action: that's
easy, squire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Well, what is a chose is a <hi rend="italics">chose in possession</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—A chosen possession? A chosen possession—(<hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—
Don't repeat the question—answer it, if you please. <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Well—
I won't—)</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—A chosen possession?—Yes—exactly—jess so—
ahem—(here K. looked about for a stick, picked one up and began
whittling with a knife—then muttering absently)—“A chosen
possession? Why, squire, if a man has two possessions to be
chose, which he is to chuse as a guard<hi rend="italics">een</hi> which the estate have
not been divided, and they come to a divide of it in lots which the
commissioners has set aside and prized, and he chooses one of
them possessions, <hi rend="italics">which</hi> one he chooses, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> is the chosen
possession. That aint hard nuther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Mr. K. how many fees are there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—How many fees?—why squire, several: doctor's
fees, lawyer's fees, sheriff's fees, jailer's fees, clerk's fees, both
courts, and most every body else's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—What is the difference between a fee simple and a
contingent fee?</p>
            <pb n="327"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—The difference between a fee—(here G. told him not to
repeat the question, K. promised he wouldn't, and resumed).</p>
            <p>The difference between—yes—exactly—jess so. Why,
squire—a simple fee is where a client gives his lawyer so much
any how, let it go how it will; and a contingent fee is where he
takes it on the sheeres, and no cure no pay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—What are the marital rights of a husband at common law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—The martal rites?—(smiling)—concerning of what,
squire?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Her property?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—Oh—<hi rend="italics">that</hi>—why—yes—jess so—why, squire, he gets
her track,—i.e., if he can without committing a tres<hi rend="italics">pass</hi>—
what's hers is his, and what's his is his own. Squire, I know'd that
before ever I opened a law-book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Is the wife entitled to dower in the husband's lands if
she survives him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—O—yes, squire—in course—I've seen that tried in
Alabama; that is, squire, you understand if the estate is solvent
to pay the debts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Suppose the husband's estate is insolvent—what then?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Why, then, in course not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Why not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Why not?—why, squire, it stands to reason: for then,
you see, the husband might gather a whole heap of land, and then
jest fraudently die to give his wife dower rights to
<pb n="328"/>
his land. I jest know plenty of men about here mean enough to
do it, and jump at the chance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Has a man a <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> right to dispose of his property by
will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Why, now, squire, concerning of that—my mind sent so
clare as on tether pints—it strikes me sort a vague—
something about a cow laying or that should have laid down in a
place which she had a right, and another cow-beast, nor airy
another havin' no rights to disturb her:—aint that <hi rend="italics">it</hi>, squire?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Suppose, Mr. K., a tenant for life, should hold over
after the termination of his estate, what kind of action would you
bring against him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Tenant for life—hold—termination of the state?—
ugh—um—jess so—Squire, sent that mortmain—the statue of
mortmain—in Richard the 8th's time?—Blackstone says
something about <hi rend="italics">that</hi>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Mr. K., if a man wants to keep his property in his
family, how far can he make it descend to his children and
grand-children, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Why as to that—something, squire, about all the candles
burning—but, squire, I never could understand what burning
candles had to do with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—What is an estate tail female, contingent on the
happening of a past event, limited by contingent devise to the
children of grantees after possibility of issue extinct, considered
with reference to the statute <hi rend="italics">De Donis</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Squire, the Devil himself couldn't answer that, and
<pb n="329"/>
I guess he's as smart as airy other lawyer—but I reckon
it is  -</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Well, Mr. K., what is the distinction between <hi rend="italics">Law</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">Equity</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Why, squire, Law is as it happens—'cordin' to proof and
the way the juror goes; Eekity is jestis—and a man may git a
devilish sight of law, and git devilish little jestis.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Does Equity ever interfere with Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—Not that ever <hi rend="italics">I</hi> seed, squire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Whose son is a bastard considered in law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>—Why, squire, that's further than I've got—<hi rend="italics">I've</hi> ginerally
seed that it was laid to the young man in the settle<hi rend="italics">ment</hi> best able
to pay over its main<hi rend="italics">tain</hi>ance; and, I suppose, it would be <hi rend="italics">his
son-in-law</hi>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—What is a libel?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—Why, squire, if a man gits another in a room, and locks
the door on him, and makes him sign a paper certifying he's told a
lie on him, the paper is  <hi rend="italics">a lie-bill</hi>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—What is the difference between <hi rend="italics">Trespass</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Case</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">K</hi>.—Why, squire, Tres<hi rend="italics">pass</hi> ar when a man tres<hi rend="italics">passes</hi> on
another. Now, squire, your putting so many hard questions to
<hi rend="italics">me</hi>, that is a tres<hi rend="italics">pass</hi>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">G</hi>.—Yes; and if the fellow can't answer a single one, <hi rend="italics">I</hi> should
say <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was a Case.</p>
            <p>Here the examination closed. Jefferson walked slowly out of
the grocery, and, after getting about thirty yards off on the
green, beckoned me to him.</p>
            <pb n="330"/>
            <p>As I came towards him, he drew himself up with some
dignity, took aim at a chip, about fifteen feet off, and squirted a
stream of tobacco juice at it with remarkable precision. Said he,
slowly and with marked gravity, “B-, you needn't make any
report of this thing to the Judge. I believe I won't go in. I don't
know as it's any harder than I took it at the fust—but, then,
B-, ther's, so, d-d, much, more, of, it.”</p>
