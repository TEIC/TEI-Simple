        <head>The TEI Processing Model</head>
        <div>
          <head>Introduction</head>
          <p>TEI elements are generally
	<emph>descriptive</emph> of the interpreted semantics of the
	source text (<q>this is a title</q>, <q>this is a
	quotation</q>), where the interpretation is often based on a
	human interpretation of layout. The <att>rend</att>,
	<att>rendition</att> and <att>style</att> attributes
	are sometimes, but not necessarily, used to describe that
	layout. The resulting encoded text is very amenable to
	analysis, but for the common case of re-presenting the text on
	the web or in print as a digital edition, the TEI model by itself is incomplete.</p>
          <p>The processing model notation allows each element to be
        assigned to a structural category (<gi>model</gi>), and given
        an outline rendition description (<gi>outputRendition</gi>). This
        allows a processor to know whether to handle the element or
        not, and broadly speaking how to display or otherwise process
        it. The model and rendition instructions are part of the 
        TEI ODD, so can be changed in TEI customizations in the normal
	  way.</p>
          <p>

              <head>Processing model workflow</head>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>This method of working (known informally as the Rahtz Rationale) assumes a workflow with three parts, and three
	distinct roles, to create a digital edition from a TEI text:
	<list rend="ordered"><item>an <emph>editor</emph> manages the text integrity,
	  makes the high-level output decisions. These 	fall into two parts
	<list rend="ordered"><item><emph>Structural</emph> descriptions, eg  <q>should the
	  original or corrected version be displayed by default</q>,
	  or <q>is this a block level or inline component</q></item><item>Indications of <emph>appearance</emph> (<q>titles are in
	  italics</q>).</item></list>
	  </item><item>a <emph>designer</emph> creates the output envelope (for
	  example, and book layout using InDesign, or a web site using
	  Drupal), making decisions in conjunction with the editor
	  (<q>use Garamond font throughout</q> or <q>every page must
	  show the departmental logo</q>)</item><item>a <emph>programmer</emph> takes the
	  <emph>editor</emph>'s specification, and the TEI text(s),
	  and creates the input for the <emph>designer</emph> to make
	  the output.</item></list>
	It is crucial to understand here that neither the designer nor
	the programmer need have any understanding of the semantics of
	TEI elements, or the structure of a TEI document. The
	programmer, particularly, can use the processing model rules
	to extract material from the TEI text in a relatively simple
	way. The method works for a variety of output formats, as the
	programmer simply has to provide implementations for a small
	number of functions, and understand the well-documented
	features of CSS. The concepts addressed by the functions (eg
	<q>block</q> and <q>inline</q>) are in line with XSL FO, and
	HTML; the catalogue of functions is given under the element <gi>model</gi>.</p>
          <p>A precondition for an
	implementation is that it must include an XPath 2.0 interpreter,
	as this is used in several places in the processing
	notation. </p>
          <p>It is a principle of the processing model (known informally as the
	Turska Tenet) that the transformation stage should be
	minimally intelligent; that is to say, it should contain as
	few TEI-specific rules as possible. The ODD should be as
	explicit as possible, and provide maximum expressivity to the
	  editor.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Processing model elements</head>
          <p>There are two main elements for specifying the structural
	and appearance components of a processing model:
	<specList><specDesc key="model" atts="predicate behaviour    useSourceRendition output"/><specDesc key="param" atts="name"/><specDesc key="outputRendition" atts="scope"/></specList>
	  For a given <gi>elementSpec</gi>, there can be as many
	  <gi>model</gi> statements as required. A set  of multiple
	  <gi>model</gi> statements is regarded as an
	  <hi>alternation</hi>, i.e. only one of them will be
	  applied; this is comparable to a
	  <q>case statement</q> in some programming
	  languages. If the intention is for several
	  <gi>model</gi> statements to be active at the same time,
	  they can be enclosed inside a <gi>modelSequence</gi>.
	  </p>
          <p>Within each <gi>model</gi> there can be set of
	  <gi>outputRendition</gi> elements.</p>
          <p>Let us consider a simple case, the handling of the
	<gi>hi</gi> element. We decide that it is an inline element,
	normally rendered in italics:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><model behaviour="inline"><outputRendition>font-style: italic;</outputRendition></model></egXML>
	    The <att>behaviour</att> attribute specifies the name of
	    a function, <term>inline</term>. If no <gi>param</gi>
	    is supplied to override it, the content of the inline
	    object is assumed to be the children of the element (text
	    or elements).
	    Separately, the <gi>outputRendition</gi> element uses CSS
	    syntax to specific the appearance.  It would have been
	    possible here to simply add <code>display: inline</code>
	    to the rendition, to indicate that it is inline, but the
	    intention is to separate the structural decision from the
	    appearance decision.</p>
          <p>It is common for <gi>hi</gi> to use a
	    <att>rendition</att> attribute to indicate appearance. By
	    default, this is ignored, but 
	    <att>useSourceRendition</att> can be used to indicate
	    that it should be taken account of:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><model behaviour="inline" useSourceRendition="true"><outputRendition>font-style: italic;</outputRendition></model></egXML>
	    in this case the <gi>outputRendition</gi> is only a fallback and
	    may be overridden by the <att>rendition</att> attribute. This uses
	    the same behaviour as CSS; ie if <att>rendition</att>
	    involves a change to a different property than
	    <q>font-style</q>, then this remains active.</p>
          <p>If the processing model is context-dependent, we can
	    use <att>predicate</att> (an XPath 2.0 expression) to show
	    when different models apply:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><model predicate="ancestor::p" behaviour="inline"><outputRendition>font-style: italic;</outputRendition></model><model behaviour="block"><outputRendition>left-margin: 2em;</outputRendition></model></egXML>
	    Here the <gi>model</gi>s are <emph>alternatives</emph>;
	    only if the test (the <att>predicate</att>) on the first
	    fails will the second be activated.</p>
          <p>So far we have mapped TEI elements to simple block and
	    inline concepts. A more complex example is provided by
	    processing the <gi>choice</gi> element; this is commonly
	    used to provide a pair of alternates (eg <gi>sic</gi> and
	    <gi>corr</gi>), and our processing model has decided to
	    show
	    the corrected version by default, but allow for  the
	    implementation to switch to, or display (perhaps as a
	    tooltip), the alternate; this service is provided by a
	    function <term>alternate</term>. We have three models, for
	    different cases of input:
           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><model predicate="sic and corr" behaviour="alternate"><param name="default">corr</param><param name="alternate">sic</param></model><model predicate="abbr and expan[1]" behaviour="alternate"><param name="default">expan</param><param name="alternate">abbr</param></model><model predicate="orig and reg" behaviour="alternate"><param name="default">reg</param><param name="alternate">orig</param></model></egXML>
	   Here there are named <gi>param</gi> children of
	   <gi>model</gi>, which provide parameters to the function
	   given by <att>behaviour</att>. The content of the
	   parameters is always an XPath 2.0 expression. Thus in the
	  example above, we specify <code>expan[1]</code> to choose
	  the first of any available set of <gi>expan</gi>
	  children.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we want different behaviour for different
	   output formats, specified using <att>output</att>; the
	   following example is designed to handle <gi>date</gi>,
	   which has an optional <att>when</att> containing a
	   regularized data. We  allow for three situations: a) when there is text inside
	   the element, and we are making print; b) when there is no
	   text but there is a <att>when</att> attribute; and c) when
	   we are making web pages. In the latter case, we use the
	   same <term>alternate</term> function as in the previous example,
	   but for print we force use of <att>when</att> when it is present.
           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><model output="print" predicate="text()" behaviour="inline"/><model output="print" predicate="@when     and not(text())" behaviour="inline"><param name="content">@when</param></model><model predicate="@when" output="web" behaviour="alternate"><param name="default">.</param><param name="alternate">@when</param></model></egXML>
	   </p>
          <p>Elements which have attributes can access the values
	   using the usual XPath 2.0 notation. For example, the
	   <gi>ref</gi> element has an important attribute,
	   <att>target</att>, to which is a link should be
	   created. Sometimes the <gi>ref</gi> has text content, but
	   sometimes just the <att>target</att>. Our rule caters for
	   these two situations:
           <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><model predicate="not(text())" behaviour="link"><param name="content">@target</param><param name="link">@target</param></model><model behaviour="link"><param name="content">.</param><param name="link">@target</param></model></egXML>
	   Here the <term>link</term> function has  two <gi>param</gi>, the text
	   to be shown, and the URL to which it should be linked.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Implementing the TEI processing model</head>
        <p>A program which implements this processing model should
	   proceed as follows:
	   <list rend="ordered"><item>When processing an element in the instance
	     document,  any applicable <gi>model</gi> or
	     <gi>modelSequence</gi> for the current
	     output format should be followed. Process them in order until a match with
	     the <att>predicate</att> is found, or a <gi>model</gi>
	     with no <att>predicate</att> is available. If a
	     <gi>model</gi> has no <att>predicate</att>, it matches
	     any occurrence of the element. If a
	     <gi>model</gi> has no <att>output</att>, it applies to
	     all outputs.
	     </item><item>All of the <gi>model</gi>s inside a
	     <gi>modelSequence</gi> should be applied in order
	     (although they may have limiting <att>predicate</att>s</item><item>Follow the function provided by the
	     <att>behaviour</att> attribute. Where the value passed to
	     that function is <q>.</q>, follow this process for all
	     child elements of the current element, within the context
	     of the named function. Thus a <term>block</term>
	     should create a block-type object in the output
	     for this element and all the results from processing its children.</item><item>If there are possible <gi>model</gi>s, but none has a
	     <att>predicate</att> which matches the current element,
	     proceed to its children and see if there are models for
	     them.</item><item>If there is no <gi>model</gi> provided for the
	     element, proceed to its children and see if there are
	     models for them.</item><item>The special function <term>omit</term> means that
	     processing should stop for this element, and move to the
	     next sibling.</item></list>

	   </p>
        <p>This is broadly similar to the processing model for XSLT. </p>
