               <head>CHAPTER I</head>
               <head>A Discovery</head>
               <p>You must go back with me to the autumn of 1827. 
</p>
               <p>My father, as you know, was a sort of gentleman farmer in —shire; 
and I, by his express desire, succeeded him in the same quiet 
occupation, not very willingly, for ambition urged me to higher 
aims, and self-conceit assured me that, in disregarding its voice, I 
was burying my talent in the earth, and hiding my light under a 
bushel. My mother had done her utmost to persuade' me that I was 
capable of great achievements; but my father, who thought ambition 
was the surest road to ruin, and change but another word for 
destruction, would listen to no scheme for bettering either my own 
condition, or that of my fellow mortals. He assured me it was all 
rubbish, and exhorted me, with his dying breath, to continue in the 
good old way, to follow his steps, and those of his father before 
him, and let my highest ambition be, to walk honestly through the 
world, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, and to 
transmit the paternal acres to my children in, at least, as 
flourishing a condition as he left them to me. 
</p>
               <p>`Well!—an honest and industrious farmer is one of the most useful 
members of society; and if I devote my talents to the cultivation of 
my farm, and the improvement of agriculture in general, I shall 
thereby benefit, not only my own immediate connections and 
dependants, but in some degree, mankind at large:—hence I shall not 
have lived in vain.' 
</p>
               <p>With such reflections as these, I was endeavouring to console 
myself, as I plodded home from the field, one cold, damp, cloudy 
evening towards the close of October. But the gleam of a bright red 
fire through the parlour window had more effect in cheering my 
spirits, and rebuking my thankless repinings, than all the sage 
reflections and good resolutions I had forced my mind to frame;—for 
I was young then, remember—only four and twenty—and had not 
acquired half the rule over my own spirit, that I now 
possess,—trifling as that may be. 
</p>
               <p>However, that haven of bliss must not be entered till I had 
exchanged my miry boots for a clean pair of shoes, and my rough 
surtout for a respectable coat, and made myself generally 
presentable before decent society; for my mother, with all her 
kindness, was vastly particular on certain points. 
</p>
               <p>In ascending to my room, I was met upon the stairs by a smart, 
pretty girl of nineteen, with a tidy, dumpy figure, a round face, 
bright, blooming cheeks, glossy, clustering curls, and little merry 
brown eyes. I need not tell you this was my sister Rose. She is, I 
know, a comely matron still, and, doubtless, no less lovely—in 
<hi>your</hi> eyes—than on the happy day you first beheld her. 
Nothing told me then, that she, a few years hence, would be the wife 
of one—entirely unknown to me as yet, but destined, hereafter, to 
become a closer friend than even herself, more intimate than that 
unmannerly lad of seventeen, by whom I was collared in the passage, 
on coming down, and wellnigh jerked off my equilibrium, and who, in 
correction for his impudence, received a resounding whack over the 
sconce, which, however, sustained no serious injury from the 
infliction; as besides being more than commonly thick, it was 
protected by a redundant shock of short, reddish curls, that my 
mother called auburn. 
</p>
               <p>On entering the parlour, we found that honoured lady seated in her 
armchair at the fireside, working away at her knitting, according to 
her usual custom, when she had nothing else to do. She had swept the 
hearth, and made a bright blazing fire for our reception; the 
servant had just brought in the tea-tray; and Rose was producing the 
sugar-basin and tea-caddy from the cupboard in the black, oak 
sideboard, that shone like polished ebony in the cheerful parlour 
twilight. 
</p>
               <p>`Well! here they both are,' cried my mother, looking round upon us 
without retarding the motion of her nimble fingers and glittering 
needles. `Now shut the door, and come to the fire, while Rose gets 
the tea ready; I'm sure you must be starved;—and tell me what 
you've been about all day; I like to know what my children have been 
about.' 
</p>
               <p>`I've been breaking in the grey colt—no easy business 
that—directing the ploughing of the last wheat stubble—for the 
ploughboy has not the sense to direct himself—and carrying out a 
plan for the extensive and efficient draining of the low 
meadow-lands.' 
</p>
               <p>`That's my brave boy!—and Fergus—what have you been doing?' 
</p>
               <p>`Badger-baiting.' 
</p>
               <p>And here he proceeded to give a particular account of his sport, and 
the respective traits of prowess evinced by the badger and the dogs; 
my mother pretending to listen with deep attention, and watching 
his. animated countenance with a degree of maternal admiration I 
thought highly disproportioned to its object. 
</p>
               <p>`It's time you should be doing something else, Fergus,' said I, as 
soon as a momentary pause in his narration allowed me to get in a 
word. 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>can</hi> I do?' replied he; `my mother won't let me go to 
sea or enter the army; and I'm determined to do nothing else—except 
make myself such a nuisance to you all, that you will be thankful to 
get rid of me, on any terms.' 
</p>
               <p>Our parent soothingly stroked his stiff., short curls. He growled, 
and tried to look sulky, and then, we all took our seats at the 
table, in obedience to the thrice repeated summons of Rose. 
</p>
               <p>`Now take your tea,' said she; `and I'll tell you what I've been 
doing. I've been to call on the Wilsons; and it's a thousand pities 
you didn't go with me, Gilbert, for Eliza Millward was there!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well! what of her?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh nothing!—I'm not going to tell you about her;—only that she's 
a nice, amusing little thing, when she is in a merry humour, and I 
shouldn't mind calling her—` 
</p>
               <p>`Hush, hush, my dear! your brother has no such idea!' whispered my 
mother, earnestly, holding up her finger. 
</p>
               <p>`Well,' resumed Rose; `I was going to tell you an important piece of 
news I heard there—I've been bursting with it ever since. You know 
it was reported a month ago, that somebody was going to take 
Wildfell Hall—and—what do you think? It has actually been 
inhabited above a week!—and we never knew!' 
</p>
               <p>`Impossible!' cried my mother. 
</p>
               <p>`Preposterous!!!' shrieked Fergus. 
</p>
               <p>`It has indeed!—and by a single lady!' 
</p>
               <p>`Good gracious, my dear! The place is in ruins!' 
</p>
               <p>`She has had two or three rooms made habitable; and there she lives, 
all alone—except an old woman for a servant!' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh dear! that spoils it—I'd hoped she was a witch,' observed 
Fergus, while carving his inch-thick slice of bread and butter. 
</p>
               <p>`Nonsense, Fergus! But isn't it strange, mamma?' 
</p>
               <p>`Strange! I can hardly believe it.' 
</p>
               <p>`But you may believe it; for Jane Wilson has seen her. She went with 
her mother, who, of course, when she heard of a stranger being in 
the neighbourhood, would be on pins and needles till she had seen 
her and got all she could out of her. She is called Mrs Graham, and 
she is in mourning—not widow's weeds, but slightish mourning—and 
she is quite young, they say,—not above five or six and 
twenty,—but <hi>so</hi> reserved! They tried all they could to find 
out who she was, and where she came from, and all about her, but 
neither Mrs Wilson, with her pertinacious and impertinent home 
thrusts, nor Miss Wilson, with her skilful manoeuvering, could 
manage to elicit a single satisfactory answer, or even a casual 
remark, or chance expression calculated to allay their curiosity, or 
throw the faintest ray of light upon her history, circumstances, or 
connexions. Moreover, she was barely civil to them, and evidently 
better pleased to say “goodbye,” than “how do you do.” But Eliza 
Millward says her father intends to call upon her soon, to offer 
some pastoral advice, which he fears she needs, as though she is 
known to have entered the neighbourhood early last week, she did not 
make her appearance at church on Sunday; and she—Eliza, that 
is—will beg to accompany him, and is sure she can succeed in 
wheedling something out of her—you know, Gilbert, she can do 
anything. And we should call sometime, mamma; it's only proper, you 
know.' 
</p>
               <p>`Of course, my dear. Poor thing! how lonely she must feel!' 
</p>
               <p>`And pray be quick about it; and mind you bring me word how much 
sugar she puts in her tea, and what sort of caps and aprons she 
wears, and all about it; for I don't know how I can live till I 
know,' said Fergus, very gravely. 
</p>
               <p>But if he intended the speech to be hailed as a master-stroke of 
wit, he signally failed, for nobody laughed. However, he was not 
much disconcerted at that; for when he had taken a mouthful of bread 
and butter, and was about to swallow a gulp of tea, the humour of 
the thing burst upon him with such irresistible force, that he was 
obliged to jump up from the table, and rush snorting and choking 
from the room; and a minute after, was heard screaming in fearful 
agony in the garden. 
</p>
               <p>As for me, I was hungry, and contented myself with silently 
demolishing the tea, ham, and toast, while my mother and sister went 
on talking, and continued to discuss the apparent, or non-apparent 
circumstances, and probable, or improbable history of the mysterious 
lady; but I must confess that, after my brother's misadventure, I 
once or twice raised the cup to my lips, and put it down again 
without daring to taste the contents, lest I should injure my 
dignity by a similar explosion. 
</p>
               <p>The next day, my mother and Rose hastened to pay their compliments 
to the fair recluse; and came back but little wiser than they went; 
though my mother declared she did not regret the journey, for if she 
had not gained much good, she flattered herself she had imparted 
some, and that was better: she had given some useful advice, which, 
she hoped, would not be thrown away; for Mrs Graham, though she said 
little to any purpose, and appeared somewhat self-opinionated, 
seemed not incapable of reflection,—though she did not know where 
she had been all her life, poor thing, for she betrayed a lamentable 
ignorance on certain points, and had not even the sense to be 
ashamed of it. 
</p>
               <p>`On what points, mother?' asked I. 
</p>
               <p>`On household matters, and all the little niceties of cookery, and 
such things, that every lady ought to be familiar with, whether she 
be required to make a practical use of her knowledge or not. I gave 
her some useful pieces of information, however, and several 
excellent receipts, the value of which, she evidently could not 
appreciate, for she begged I would not trouble myself, as she lived 
in such a plain, quiet way, that she was. sure she should never make 
use of them. “No matter, my dear,” said I; “it is what every 
respectable female ought to know;—and besides, though you are lone 
now, you will not be always so; you <hi>have</hi> been married, and 
probably—I might say almost certainly—will be again.” “You are 
mistaken there, ma'am,” said she, almost haughtily; “I am certain 
never shall.”—But I told her I knew better.' 
</p>
               <p>`Some romantic young widow, I suppose,' said I, `come there to end 
her days in solitude, and mourn in secret for the dear departed—but 
it won't last long.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I think not,' observed Rose, `for she didn't seem very 
disconsolate after all; and she's excessively pretty—handsome 
rather—you must see her, Gilbert; you will call her a perfect 
beauty, though you could hardly pretend to discover a resemblance b~ 
tween her and Eliza Millward.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I can imagine many faces more beautiful than Eliza's, though 
not more charming. I allow she has small claims to perfection; but 
then, I maintain that, if she were more perfect, she would be less 
interesting.' 
</p>
               <p>`And so you prefer her faults to other people's perfections?' 
</p>
               <p>`Just so—saving my mother's presence.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, my dear Gilbert, what nonsense you talk!—I know you don't mean 
it; it's quite out of the question,' said my mother, getting up, and 
bustling out of the room, under pretence of household business, in 
order to escape the contradiction that was trembling on my 
tongue. 
</p>
               <p>After that, Rose favoured me with further particulars respecting Mrs 
Graham. Her appearance, manners, and dress, and the very furniture 
of the room she inhabited, were all set before me, with rather more 
clearness and precision than I cared to see them; but, as I was not 
a very attentive listener, I could not repeat the description if I 
would. 
</p>
               <p>The next day was Saturday; and, on Sunday, everybody wondered 
whether or not the fair unknown would profit by the vicar's 
remonstrance, and come to church. I confess, I looked with some 
interest myself towards the old family pew, appertaining to Wildfell 
Hall, where the faded crimson cushions and lining had been unpressed 
and unrenewed so many years, and the grim escutcheons, with their 
lugubrious borders of rusty black cloth, frowned so sternly from the 
wall above. 
</p>
               <p>And there I beheld a tall, lady-like figure, clad in black. Her face 
was towards me, and there was something in it, which, once seen, 
invited me to look again. Her hair was raven black, and disposed in 
long glossy ringlets, a style of coiffure rather unusual in those 
days, but always graceful and becoming; her complexion was clear and 
pale, her eyes I could not see, for being bent upon, her prayer book 
they were concealed by their drooping lids and long black lashes, 
but the brows above were expressive and well defined, the forehead 
was lofty and intellectual, the nose, a perfect aquiline, and the 
features in general, unexceptionable—only there was a slight 
hollowness about the cheeks and eyes, and the lips, though finely 
formed, were a little too thin, a little too firmly compressed, and 
had something about them that betokened, I thought, no very soft or 
amiable temper; and I said in my heart— 
</p>
               <p>`I would rather admire you from this distance, fair lady, than be 
the partner of your home.' 
</p>
               <p>Just then, she happened to raise her eyes, and they met mine; I dl~d 
not choose to withdraw my gaze, and she turned again to her book, 
but with a momentary, indefinable expression of quiet scorn, that 
was inexpressibly provoking to me. 
</p>
               <p>`She thinks me an impudent puppy,' thought I. `Humph!—she hall 
change her mind before long, if I think it worthwhile.' 
</p>
               <p>But then, it flashed upon me that these were very improper thoughts 
for a place of worship, and that my behaviour, on the present 
occasion, was anything but what it ought to be. Previous, however, 
to directing my mind to the service, I glanced round the church to 
see if anyone had been observing me;—but no,—all who were not 
attending to their prayer-books, were attending to he strange 
lady,—my good mother and sister among the rest, and drs Wilson and 
her daughter; and even Eliza Millward was slyly lancing from the 
corners of her eyes towards the object of general attraction. Then, 
she glanced at me, simpered a little, and blushed, modestly looked 
at her prayer-book, and endeavoured to compose her features. 
</p>
               <p>Here I was transgressing again; and this time I was made sensible of 
it by a sudden dig in the ribs, from the elbow of my pert other. For 
the present, I could only resent the insult by pressing my foot upon 
his toes, deferring further vengeance till we got out church. 
</p>
               <p>Now, Halford, before I close this letter, I'll tell you who Eliza 
Millward was; she was the vicar's younger daughter, and a very 
engaging little creature, for whom I felt no small degree of 
partiality;—and she knew it, though I had never come to any direct 
planation, and had no definite intention of so doing, for my mother, 
who maintained there was no one good enough for me, within twenty 
miles round, could not bear the thought of my marrying that 
insignificant little thing, who, in addition to her numerous other 
disqualifications, had not twenty pounds to call her own. Eliza's 
figure was at once slight and plump, her face small, and nearly as 
round as my sister's,—complexion, something similar to hers, but 
more delicate and less decidedly blooming,—nose, 
<hi>retroussé</hi>,—features, generally irregular;—and, 
altogether, she was rather charming than pretty. But her eyes—I 
must not forget those remarkable features, for therein her chief 
attraction lay—in outward aspect at least;—they were long and 
narrow in shape, the irids black, or very dark brown, the expression 
various, and ever changing, but always either preternaturally—I had 
almost said <hi>diabolically</hi>—wicked, or irresistibly 
bewitching—often both. Her voice was gentle and childish, her tread 
light and soft as that of a cat;—but her manners more frequently 
resembled those of a pretty, playful kitten, that is now pert and 
roguish, now timid and demure, according to its own sweet will. 
</p>
               <p>Her sister, Mary, was several years older, several inches taller, 
and of a larger, coarser build—a plain, quiet, sensible girl, who 
had patiently nursed their mother through her last long, tedious 
illness, and been the housekeeper and family drudge from thence to 
the present time. She was trusted and valued by her father, loved 
and courted by all dogs, cats, children, and poor people, and 
slighted and neglected by everybody else. 
</p>
               <p>The Reverend Michael Millward himself was a tall, ponderous, elderly 
gentleman, who placed a shovel hat above his large, square, 
massive-featured face, carried a stout walking stick in his hand, 
and encased his still powerful limbs in knee breeches and 
gaiters,—or black silk stockings on state occasions. He was a man 
of fixed principles, strong prejudices, and regular 
habits,—intolerant of dissent in any shape, acting under a firm 
conviCtion that his opinions were always right, and whoever differed 
from them, must be, either most deplorably ignorant, or wilfully 
blind. 
</p>
               <p>In childhood, I had always been accustomed to regard him with a 
feeling of reverential awe—but lately, even now, surmounted, for, 
though he had a fatherly kindness for the well-behaved, he was a 
strict disciplinarian, and had often sternly proved our juvenile 
failings and peccadillos; and moreover, in those days whenever he 
called upon our parents, we had to stand up before him, and say our 
catechism, or repeat `How doth the little busy bee, or some other 
hymn, or—worse than all—be questioned about his last text and the 
heads of the discourse, which we never could remember. Sometimes, 
the worthy gentleman would reprove my mother for being over 
indulgent to her sons, with a reference to old Eli, or David and 
Absalom, which was particularly galling to her feelings; and, very 
highly as she respected him, and all his sayings, I once heard her 
exclaim, `I wish to goodness he had a son himself! He wouldn't be so 
ready with his advice to other people then;—he'd see what it is to 
have a couple of boys to keep in order.' 
</p>
               <p>He had a laudable care for his own bodily health—kept very early 
hours, regularly took a walk before breakfast, was vastly particular 
about warm and dry clothing, had never been known to preach a sermon 
without previously swallowing a raw egg—albeit he was gifted with 
good lungs and a powerful voice,—and was, generally, extremely 
particular about what he ate and drank, though by no means 
abstemious, and having a mode of dietary peculiar to himself,—being 
a great despiser of tea and such slops, and a patron of malt 
liquors, bacon and eggs, ham, hung beef, and other strong meats, 
which agreed well enough with his digestive organs, and therefore 
were maintained by him to be good and wholesome for everybody, and 
confidently recommended to the most delicate convalescents or 
dyspeptics, who, if they failed to derive the promised benefit from 
his prescriptions, were told it was because they had not persevered, 
and if they complained of inconvenient results therefrom, were 
assured it was all fancy. 
</p>
               <p>I will just touch upon two other persons whom I have mentioned, and 
then bring this long letter to a close. These are Mrs Wilson and her 
daughter. The former was the widow of a substantial farmer, a 
narrow-minded, tattling old gossip, whose character is not worth 
describing. She had two sons, Robert, a rough countrified farmer, 
and Richard, a retiring, studious young man, who was studying the 
classics with the vicar's assistance, pro paring for college, with a 
view to enter the church. 
</p>
               <p>Their sister Jane was a young lady of some talents and more 
ambition. She had, at her own desire, received a regular boarding. 
school education, superior to what any member of the family had 
obtained before. She had taken the polish well, acquired 
considerable elegance of manners, quite lost her provincial accent, 
and could boast of more accomplishments than the vicar's daughters. 
She was considered a beauty besides; but never for a moment could 
she number me amongst her admirers. She was about six and twenty, 
rather tall and very slender, her hair was neither chestnut nor 
auburn, but a most decided bright, light red, her complexion was 
remarkably fair and brilliant, her head small, neck long, chin well 
turned, but very short, lips thin and red, eyes clear hazel, quick 
and penetrating, but entirely destitute of poetry or feeling. She 
had, or might `have had, many suitors in her own rank of life, but 
scornfully repulsed or rejected them all; for none but a gentleman 
could please her refined taste, and none but a rich one could 
satisfy her soaring ambition. One gentleman there was, from whom she 
had lately received some rather pointed attentions, and upon whose 
heart, name, and fortune, it was whispered, she had serious designs. 
This was Mr Lawrence, the young squire whose family had formerly 
occupied Wildfell Hall, but had deserted it, some fifteen years ago, 
for a more modern and commodious mansion in the neighbouring 
parish. 
</p>
               <p>Now, Halford, I bid you adieu for the present. This is the first 
instalment of my debt. If the coin suits you, tell me so, and I'll 
send you the rest at my leisure: if you would rather remain my 
creditor than stuff your purse with such ungainly heavy 
pieces,—tell me still, and I'll pardon your bad taste, and 
willingly keep the treasure to myself. 
</p>
               <p>Yours immutably, 
</p>
               <p>GILBERT MARKHAM.

               <head>CHAPTER II</head>
               <head>An Interview</head>
               <p>I PERCEIVE, with joy, my most valued friend, that the cloud of your 
displeasure has passed away; the light of your countenance blesses 
me once more, and you desire the continuation of my story: 
therefore, without more ado, you shall have it. 
</p>
               <p>I think the day I last mentioned was a certain Sunday, the latest in 
the October of 1827. On the following Tuesday I was out with my dog 
and gun, in pursuit of such game as I could find within the 
territory of Linden-Car; but finding none at all, I turned my arms 
against the hawks and carrion crows, whose depredations, as I 
suspected, had deprived me of better prey. To this end, I left the 
more frequented regions, the wooded valleys, the cornfields, and the 
meadow lands, and proceeded to mount the steep acclivity of 
Wildfell, the wildest and the loftiest eminence in our 
neighbourhood, where, as you ascend, the hedges, as well as the 
flees, become scanty and stunted, the former, at length, giving 
place to rough stone fences, partly greened over with ivy and moss, 
the latter to larches and Scotch fir-trees, or isolated blackthorns. 
The fields, being rough and stony and wholly unfit for the plough, 
were mostly devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle; the soil 
was thin and poor: bits of grey rock here and there peeped out from 
the grassy hillocks; bilberry plants and heather—relics of more 
savage wildness—grew under the walls; and in many of the 
enclosures, ragweeds and rushes usurped supremacy over the scanty 
herbage;—but these were not <hi>my</hi> property. 
</p>
               <p>Near the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood 
Wildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built 
of dark grey stone,—venerable and picturesque to look at, but, 
doubtless, cold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone 
mullions and little latticed panes, its time-eaten air-holes, and 
its too lonely, too unsheltered situation,—only shielded from the 
war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half 
blighted with storms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall 
itself. Behind it lay a few desolate fields, and then, the brown, 
heath-clad summit of the hill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, 
and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey 
granite—similar to those which decorated the roof and 
gables—surmounting the gate-posts), was a garden,—once, stocked 
with such hardy plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and 
climate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the 
gardener's torturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes he 
chose to give them,—now, having been left so many years, untilled 
and untrimmed, abandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost 
and the wind, the rain and the drought, it presented a very singular 
appearance indeed. The close green walls of privet, that had 
bordered the principal walk, were two thirds withered away, and the 
rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds; the old boxwood swan, that 
sat beside the scraper, had lost its neck and half its body; the 
castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden, the 
gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway, and the lion 
that guarded the other, were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as 
resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in the waters under 
the earth; but, to my young imagination, they presented all of them 
a goblinish appearance, that harmonized well with the ghostly 
legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the 
haunted hall and its departed occupants. 
</p>
               <p>I had succeeded in killing a hawk and two crows when I came within 
sight of the mansion; and then, relinquishing further depredations, 
I sauntered on, to have a look at the old place, and see what 
changes had been wrought in it by its new inhabitant. I did not to 
go quite to the front and stare in at the gate; but I paused beside 
the garden wall, and looked, and saw no change—except In one wing, 
where the broken windows and dilapidated roof had evidently been 
repaired, and where a thin wreath of smoke was curling up from the 
stack of chimneys. 
</p>
               <p>While I thus stood, leaning on my gun, and looking up at the dark 
gables, sunk in an idle reverie, weaving a tissue of wayward 
fancies, in which old associations and the fair young hermit, now 
within those walls, bore a nearly equal part, I heard a slight 
rustling and scrambling just within the garden; and, glancing in the 
direction whence the sound proceeded, I beheld a tiny hand elevated 
above the wall: it clung to the topmost stone, and then another 
little hand was raised to take a firmer hold, and then appeared a 
small white forehead, surmounted with wreaths of light brown hair, 
with a pair of deep blue eyes beneath, and the upper portion of a 
diminutive ivory nose. 
</p>
               <p>The eyes did not notice me, but sparkled with glee on beholding 
Sancho, my beautiful black and white setter, that was coursing about 
the field with its muzzle to the ground. The little creature raised 
its face and called aloud to the dog. The good-natured animal 
paused, looked up, and wagged his tail, but made no further 
advances. The child (a little boy, apparently about five years old) 
scrambled up to the top of the wall and called again and again; but 
finding this of no avail, apparently made up his mind, like Mahomet, 
to go to the mountain” since the mountain would not come to him, and 
attempted to get over; but a crabbed old cherry tree, that grew hard 
by, caught him by the frock in one of its crooked, scraggy arms that 
stretched over the wall. In attempt- mpg to disengage himself, his 
foot slipped, and down be tumbled—but not to the earth;—the tree 
still kept him suspended. There was a silent struggle, and then a 
piercing shriek;—but, in an instant, I had dropped my gun on the 
grass, and caught the little fellow in arms. 
</p>
               <p>I wiped his eyes with his frock, told him he was all right, and ed 
Sancho to pacify him. He was just putting his little hand on dog's 
neck and beginning to smile through his tears, when I heard behind 
me, a click of the iron gate and a rustle of female garments, and 
lo! Mrs Graham darted upon me,—her neck uncovered, her black locks 
streaming in the wind. 
</p>
               <p>`Give me the child!' she said, in a voice scarce louder than a 
whisper, but with a tone of startling vehemence, and, seizing the 
boy, she snatched him from me, as if some dire contamination were in 
my touch, and then stood with one hand firmly Clasping his, the 
other on his shoulder, fixing upon me her large, luminous, dark 
eyes—pale, breathless, quivering with agitation. 
</p>
               <p>`I was not harming the child, madam,' said I, scarce knowing whether 
to be most astonished or displeased; `he was tumbling off the wall 
there; and I was so fortunate as to catch him, hung suspended 
headlong from that tree, and prevent I know not what 
catastrophe.' 
</p>
               <p>`I beg your pardon, sir,' stammered she,—suddenly calming 
down,—the light of reason seeming to break upon her beclouded 
spirit and a faint blush mantling on her cheek—`I did not know 
you;—and I thought—' 
</p>
               <p>She stooped to kiss the child, and fondly clasped her arm round his 
neck. 
</p>
               <p>`You thought I was going to kidnap your son, I suppose?' 
</p>
               <p>She stroked his head with a half-embarrassed laugh, and 
replied,— 
</p>
               <p>`I did not know he had attempted to climb the wall.—I have the 
pleasure of addressing Mr Markham, I believe?' she added, somewhat 
abruptly. 
</p>
               <p>I bowed, but ventured to ask how she knew me. 
</p>
               <p>`Your sister called here, a few days ago, with Mrs Markham.' 
</p>
               <p>`Is the resemblance so strong then?' I asked, in some surprise, and 
not so greatly Battered at the idea as I ought to have been. 
</p>
               <p>`There is a likeness about the eyes and complexion, I think,' 
replied she, somewhat dubiously surveying my face;—`and I think I 
saw you at church on Sunday.' 
</p>
               <p>I smiled.—There was something either in that smile or the 
recollections it awakened that was particularly displeasing to her, 
for she suddenly assumed again that proud, chilly look that had so 
unspeakably roused my corruption at church—a look of repellent 
scorn, so easily assumed, and so entirely without the least 
distortion of a single feature that, while there, it seemed like the 
natural expression of the face, and was the more provoking to me, 
because I could not think it affected. 
</p>
               <p>`Good morning, Mr Markham,' said she; and without another word or 
glance, she withdrew with her child into the garden; and I returned 
home, angry and dissatisfied—I could scarcely tell you why—and 
therefore will not attempt it. 
</p>
               <p>I only stayed to put away my gun and powder-horn, and give some 
requisite directions to one of the farming-men, and then repaired to 
the vicarage, to solace my spirit and soothe my ruffled temper with 
the company and conversation of Eliza Millward. 
</p>
               <p>I found her, as usual, busy with some piece of soft embroidery (the 
mania for Berlin wools had not yet commenced), while her sister was 
seated at the chimney-corner, with the cat on her knee, mending a 
heap of stockings. 
</p>
               <p>`Mary—Mary! put them away!' Eliza was hastily saying, just as I 
entered the room. 
</p>
               <p>`Not I, indeed!' was the phlegmatic reply; and my appearance 
prevented further discussion. 
</p>
               <p>`You're so unfortunate, Mr Markham!' observed the younger sister, 
with one of her arch, sidelong glances. `Papa's just gone out into 
the parish, and not likely to be back for an hour!' 
</p>
               <p>`Never mind; I can manage to spend a few minutes with his daughters, 
if they'll allow me,' said I, bringing a chair to the fire, and 
seating myself therein, without waiting to be asked. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, if you'll be very good and amusing, we shan't object.' 
</p>
               <p>`Let your permission be unconditional, pray; for I came not to give 
pleasure, but to seek it,' I answered. 
</p>
               <p>However, I thought it but reasonable to make some slight exertion to 
render my company agreeable; and what little effort I made was 
apparently pretty successful, for Miss Eliza was never in a better 
humour. We seemed, indeed, to be mutually pleased with each other, 
and managed to maintain between us a cheerful and animated, though 
not very profound conversation. It was little better than a 
tête-à-tête, for Miss Millward never opened her 
lips, except occasionally to correct some random assertion or 
exaggerated expression of her sister's, and once to ask her to pick 
up the ball of cotton, that had rolled under the table. I did this 
myself, however, as in duty bound. 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you, Mr Markham,' said she, as I presented it to her. `I 
would have picked it up myself; only I did not want to disturb the 
cat.' 
</p>
               <p>`Mary, dear, that won't excuse you in Mr Markham's eyes,' said 
Eliza; `he hates cats, I dare say, as cordially as he does old 
maids—like all other gentlemen—Don't you, Mr Markham?' 
</p>
               <p>`I believe it is natural for our unamiable sex to dislike the 
creatures,' replied I; `for you ladies lavish so many caresses upon 
them' 
</p>
               <p>`Bless them—little darlings!' cried she, in a sudden burst of 
enthusiasm, turning round and overwhelming her sister's pet with a 
shower of kisses. 
</p>
               <p>`Don't, Eliza!' said Miss Millward, somewhat gruffly as she 
impatiently pushed her away. 
</p>
               <p>But it was time for me to be going: make what haste I would, I 
should still be too late for tea; and my mother was the soul of 
order and punctuality. 
</p>
               <p>My fair friend was evidently unwilling to bid me adieu. I tenderly 
squeezed her little hand at parting; and she repaid me with one of 
her softest smiles and most bewitching glances. I went home very 
happy, with a heart brimful of complacency for myself, and 
overflowing with love for Eliza.

               <head>CHAPTER III</head>
               <head>A Controversy</head>
               <p>Two days after, Mrs Graham called at Linden-Car, contrary to the 
expectation of Rose, who entertained an idea that the mysterious 
occupant of Wildfell Hall would wholly disregard the common 
observances of civilized life,—in which opinion she was supported 
by the Wilsons, who testified that neither their call nor the 
Millwards' had been returned as yet. Now, however, the cause of that 
omission was explained, though not entirely to the satisfaction of 
Rose. Mrs Graham had brought her child with her, and on my mother's 
expressing surprise that he could walk so far, she replied,— 
</p>
               <p>`It is a long walk for him; but I must have either taken him with 
me, or relinquished the visit altogether: for I never leave him 
alone; and I think, Mrs Markham, I must beg you to make my excuses 
to the Millwards and Mrs Wilson, when you see them, as I fear I 
cannot do myself the pleasure of calling upon them till my little 
Arthur is able to accompany me.' 
</p>
               <p>`But you have a servant,' said Rose; `could you not leave him with 
her?' 
</p>
               <p>`She has her own occupations to attend to; and besides, she is too 
old to run after a child, and he is too mercurial to be tied to an 
elderly woman. 
</p>
               <p>`But you left him to come to church.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, once; but I would not have left him for any other purpose; and 
I think, in future, I must contrive to bring him with me, or stay at 
home.' 
</p>
               <p>`Is he so mischievous?' asked my mother, considerably shocked. 
</p>
               <p>`No,' replied the lady, sadly smiling, as she stroked the wavy locks 
of her son, who was seated on a low stool at her feet, `but he is my 
only treasure; and I am his only friend, so we don't like to be 
separated.' 
</p>
               <p>`But my dear, I call that doting,' said my plain-spoken parent. 
</p>
               <p>`You should try to suppress such foolish fondness, as well to save 
your son from ruin as yourself from ridicule.' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>Ruin</hi>, Mrs Markham?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; it is spoiling the child. Even at <hi>his</hi> age, he ought not 
to be always tied to his mother's apron string; he should learn to 
be ashamed of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Mrs Markham, I beg you will not say such things in his presence, at 
least. I trust my son will <hi>never</hi> be ashamed to love his 
mother!' said Mrs Graham, with a serious energy that startled the 
company. 
</p>
               <p>My mother attempted to appease her by an explanation; but she seemed 
to think enough had been said on the subject, and abruptly turned 
the conversation. 
</p>
               <p>`Just as I thought,' said I to myself: `the lady's temper is none of 
the mildest, notwithstanding her sweet, pale face and lofty brow, 
where thought and suffering seem equally to have stamped their 
impress.' 
</p>
               <p>All this time, I was seated at a table on the other side of the 
room, apparently immersed in the perusal of a volume of the 
`Farmer's Magazine', which I happened to have been reading at the 
moment of our visitor's arrival; and, not choosing to be over civil, 
I had merely bowed as she entered, and continued my occupation as 
before. 
</p>
               <p>In a little while, however, I was sensible that someone was 
approaching me, with a light, but slow and hesitating tread. It was 
little Arthur, irresistibly attracted by my dog Sancho, that was 
lying at my feet. On looking up, I beheld him standing about two 
yards off, with his clear blue eyes wistfully gazing on the dog, 
transfixed to the spot, not by fear of the animal, but by a timid 
disinclination to approach its master. A little encouragement, 
however, induced him to come forward. The child, though shy, was not 
sullen. In a minute he was kneeling on the carpet, with his arms 
round Sancho's neck, and in a minute or two more, the little fellow 
was seated on my knee, surveying with eager interest the various 
specimens of horses, cattle, pigs, and model farms portrayed in the 
volume before me. I glanced at his mother now and then, to see how 
she relished the new-sprung intimacy; and I saw, by the unquiet 
aspect of her eye, that for some reason or other, she was uneasy at 
the child's position. 
</p>
               <p>`Arthur,' said she, at length, `come here. You are troublesome to Mr 
Markham: he wishes to read.' 
</p>
               <p>`By no means, Mrs Graham; pray let him stay. I am as much amused as 
he is,' pleaded I. But still, with hand and eye, she silently called 
him to her side. 
</p>
               <p>`No, mamma,' said the child; `let me look at these pictures first; 
and then I'll come, and tell you all about them.' 
</p>
               <p>`We are going to have a small party on Monday, the fifth of 
November,' said my mother; `and I hope you will not refuse to make 
one, Mrs Graham. You can bring your little boy with you, you know—I 
dare say we shall be able to amuse him;—and then you can make your 
own apologies to the Millwards and Wilsons,—they will all be here I 
expect.' 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you, I never go to parties.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! but this will be quite a family concern—early hours, and 
nobody here but ourselves, and just the Millwards and Wilsons, most 
of whom you already know, and Mr Lawrence, your landlord, whom you 
ought to make acquaintance with.' 
</p>
               <p>`I do know something of him—but you must excuse me this time; for 
the evenings, now, are dark and damp, and Arthur, I fear, is too 
delicate to risk exposure to their influence with impunity. We must 
defer the enjoyment of your hospitality, till the return of longer 
days and warmer nights.' 
</p>
               <p>Rose, now, at a hint from my mother, produced a decanter of wine, 
with accompaniments of glasses and cake, from the cupboard under the 
oak sideboard, and the refreshment was duly presented to the guests. 
They both partook of the cake, but obstinately refused the wine, in 
spite of their hostess's hospitable attempts to force it upon them. 
Arthur, especially, shrank from the ruby nectar as if in terror and 
disgust, and was ready to cry when urged to take it. 
</p>
               <p>`Never mind, Arthur,' said his mamma, `Mrs Markham thinks it will do 
you good, as you were tired with your walk; but she will not oblige 
you to take it;—I dare say you will do very well without. He 
detests the very sight of wine,' she added, `and the smell of it 
almost makes him sick. I have been accustomed to make him shallow a 
little wine or weak spirits-and-water, by way of medicine when he 
was sick, and, in fact, I have done what could to make him hate 
them.' 
</p>
               <p>Everybody laughed, except the young widow and her son. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Mrs Graham,' said my mother, wiping the tears of merriment 
from her bright, blue eyes—`well, you surprise me! I really gave 
you credit for having more sense—The poor child will be the veriest 
milksop that ever was sopped! Only think what a man you will make of 
him, if you persist in—' 
</p>
               <p>`I think it a very excellent plan,' interrupted Mrs Graham, with 
imperturbable gravity. `By that means I hope to save him from one 
degrading vice at least. I wish I could render the incentives to 
every other equally innoxious in his case.' 
</p>
               <p>`But by such means,' said I, `you will never render him 
virtuous.—What is it that constitutes virtue, Mrs Graham? Is it the 
circumstance of being able and willing to resist temptation; or that 
of having no temptations to resist?—Is he a strong man that 
overcomes great obstacles and performs surprising achievements, 
though by dint of great muscular exertion, and at the risk of some 
subsequent fatigue, or he that sits in his chair all day, with 
nothing to do more laborious than stirring the fire, and carrying 
his food to his mouth? If you would have your son to walk honourably 
through the world, you must not attempt to clear the stones from his 
path, but teach him to walk firmly over them—not insist upon 
leading him by the hand, but let him learn to go alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`I will lead him by the hand, Mr Markham, till he has strength to go 
alone; and I will clear as many stones from his path as I can, and 
teach him to avoid the rest—or walk firmly over them as you 
say;—for when I have done my utmost, in the way of clearance, there 
will still be plenty left to exercise all the agility, steadiness, 
and circumspection he will ever have.—It is all very well to talk 
about noble resistance, and trials of virtue; but for fifty—or five 
hundred men that have yielded to temptation, show me one that has 
had virtue to resist. And why should I take it for granted that my 
son will be one in a thousand?—and not rather prepare for the 
worst, and suppose he will be like his—like the rest of mankind, 
unless I take care to prevent it?' 
</p>
               <p>`You are very complimentary to us all,' I observed. 
</p>
               <p>`I know nothing about <hi>you</hi>—I speak of those I do know—and 
when I see the whole race of mankind (with a few rare exceptions) 
stumbling and blundering along the path of life, sinking into every 
pitfall, and breaking their shins over every impediment that lies in 
their way, shall I not use all the means in my power to ensure for 
him, a smoother and a safer passage?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but the surest means will be to endeavour to fortify him 
<hi>against</hi> temptation, not to remove it out of his way. 
</p>
               <p>`I will do both, Mr Markham. God knows he will have temptations 
enough to assail him, both from within and without, when I have done 
all I can to render vice as uninviting to him, as it is abominable 
in its own nature—I myself have had, indeed, but few incentives to 
what the world calls vice, but yet, I have experienced temptations 
and trials of another kind, that have required, on many occasions, 
more watchfulness and firmness to resist, than I have hitherto been 
able to muster against them. And this, I believe, is what most 
others would acknowledge, who are accustomed to reflection, and 
wishful to strive against their natural corruptions.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes,' said my mother, but half apprehending her drift; `but you 
would not judge of a boy by yourself—and my dear Mrs Graham, let me 
warn you in good time against the error—the fatal error, I may call 
it—of taking that boy's education upon yourself.—Because you are 
clever, in some things, and well informed, you may fancy yourself 
equal to the task; but indeed you are not; and, if you persist in 
the attempt, believe me, you will bitterly repent it when the 
mischief is done.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am to send him to school, I suppose, to learn to despise his 
mother's authority and affection!' said the lady, with a rather 
bitter smile. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, <hi>no</hi>!—But if you would have a boy to despise his mother, 
let her keep him at home, and spend her life in petting him up, and 
slaving to indulge his follies and caprices.' 
</p>
               <p>`I perfectly agree with you, Mrs Markham; but nothing can be further 
from my principles and practice than such criminal weakness as 
that.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but you will treat him like a girl—you'll spoil his spirit, 
and make a mere Miss Nancy of him—you will indeed, Mrs Graham, 
whatever you may think—But I'll get Mr Millward to talk to you 
about it:—<hi>he'll</hi> tell you the consequences;—he'll set it 
before you as plain as the day;—and tell you what you ought to do, 
and all about it;—and, I don't doubt, he'll be able to convince you 
in a minute.' 
</p>
               <p>`No occasion to trouble the vicar,' said Mrs Graham, glancing at 
me—I suppose I was smiling at my mother's unbounded confidence in 
that worthy gentleman—`Mr Markham here thinks his powers of 
conviction at least equal to Mr Millward's. If I hear not him, 
neither should I be convinced though one rose from the dead,3 he 
would tell you.—Well, Mr Markham, you that maintain that a boy 
should not be shielded from evil, but sent out to battle against it, 
alone and unassisted—not taught to avoid the snares of life, but 
boldly to rush into them, or over them, as he may—to seek danger 
rather than shun it, and feed his virtue by temptation,—would 
you—' 
</p>
               <p>`I beg your pardon, Mrs Graham—but you get on too fast. I have not 
yet said that a boy should be taught to rush into the snares of 
life,—or even wilfully to seek temptation for the sake of 
exercising his virtue by overcoming it;—I only say that it is 
better to arm and strengthen your hero, than to disarm and enfeeble 
the foe;—and if you were to rear an oak sapling in a hothouse, 
tending it carefully night and day, and shielding it from every 
breath of wind, you could not expect it to become a hardy tree, like 
that which has grown up on the mountain-side, exposed to all the 
action of the elements, and not even sheltered from the shock of the 
tempest.' 
</p>
               <p>`Granted;—but would you use the same argument with regard to a 
girl?' 
</p>
               <p>`Certainly not.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; you would have her to be tenderly and delicately nurtured, like 
a hothouse plant—taught to cling to others for direction and 
support, and guarded, as much as possible, from the very knowledge 
of evil. But will you be so good as to inform me why you make this 
distinction? Is it that you think she has no virtue?' 
</p>
               <p>`Assuredly not.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but you affirm that virtue is only elicited by 
temptation;—and you think that a woman cannot be too little exposed 
to temptation, or too little acquainted with vice, or anything 
connected therewith—It <hi>must</hi> be, either, that you think she 
is essentially so vicious, or so feeble-minded, that she 
<hi>cannot</hi> withstand temptation,—and though she may be pure and 
innocent as long as she is kept in ignorance and restraint, yet, 
being destitute of <hi>real</hi> virtue, to teach her how to sin is at 
once to make her a sinner, and the greater her knowledge, the wider 
her liberty, the deeper will be her depravity,—whereas, in the 
nobler sex, there is a natural tendency to goodness, guarded by a 
superior fortitude, which, the more it is exercised by trials and 
dangers, is only the further developed—' 
</p>
               <p>`Heaven forbid that I should think so!' I interrupted, at last. 
</p>
               <p>`Well then, it must be that you think they are <hi>both</hi> weak and 
prone to err, and the slightest error, the merest shadow of 
pollution, will ruin the one, while the character of the other will 
be strengthened and embellished—his education properly finished by 
a little practical acquaintance with forbidden things. Such 
experience, to him, (to use a trite simile) will be like the storm 
to the oak, which, though it may scatter the leaves, and snap the 
smaller branches, serves but to rivet the roots, and to harden and 
condense the fibres of the tree. You would have us encourage our 
sons to prove all things by their own experience, while our 
daughters must not even profit by the experience of others. Now I 
would have both so to benefit by the experience of others, and the 
precepts of a higher authority, that they should know beforehand to 
refuse the evil and choose the good, and require no experimental 
proofs to teach them the evil of transgression. I would not send a 
poor girl into the world unarmed against her foes, and ignorant of 
the snares that beset her path;—nor would I watch and guard her, 
till, deprived of self-respect and self-reliance, she lost the 
power, or the will, to watch and guard herself;—and as for my 
son—if I thought he would grow up to be what you call a man of the 
world—one that has “<hi>seen life</hi>,” and glories in his 
experience, even though he should so far profit by it, as to sober 
down, at length, into a useful and respected member of society—I 
would rather that he died tomorrow!—rather a thousand times!' she 
earnestly repeated, pressing her darling to her side and kissing his 
forehead with intense affection. He had, already, left his new 
companion, and been standing for some time beside his mother's knee, 
looking up into her face, and listening in silent wonder to her 
incomprehensible discourse. 
</p>
               <p>`Well! you ladies must always have the last word, I suppose, said I, 
observing her rise and begin to take leave of my mother. 
</p>
               <p>`You may have as many words as you please,—only I can't stay to 
hear them.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; that is the way: you hear just as much of an argument as you 
please; and the rest may be spoken to the wind.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you are anxious to say anything more on the subject,' replied 
she, as she shook hands with Rose, `you must bring your sister to 
see me some fine day, and I'll listen, as patiently as you could 
wish, to whatever you please to say. I would rather be lectured by 
you than the vicar, because I should have less remorse in telling 
you, at the end of the discourse, that, I preserve my own opinion 
precisely the same as at the beginning—as would be the case, I am 
persuaded, with regard to either logician.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, of course,' replied I, determined to be as provoking as 
herself; `for, when a lady does consent to listen to an argument 
against her own opinions, she is always predetermined to withstand 
it to listen only with her bodily ears, keeping the mental organs 
resolutely closed against the strongest reasoning.' 
</p>
               <p>`Good morning, Mr Markham,' said my fair antagonist, with a pitying 
smile; and deigning no further rejoinder, she slightly bowed, and 
was about to withdraw; but her son, with childish impertinence, 
arrested her by exclaiming,— 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma, you have not shaken hands with Mr Markham!' 
</p>
               <p>She laughingly turned round, and held out her hand. I gave it a 
spiteful squeeze; for I was annoyed at the continual injustice she 
had done me from the very dawn of our acquaintance, Without knowing 
anything about my real disposition and principles, she gas evidently 
prejudiced against me, and seemed bent upon showing me that her 
opinions respecting me, on every particular, fell far below those I 
entertained of myself. I was naturally touchy, or it would not have 
vexed me so much. Perhaps, too, I was a little bit spoiled by my 
mother and sister, and some other ladies of my acquaintance;—and 
yet, I was by no means a fop—of that I am fully convinced, whether 
<hi>you</hi> are or not.

            <div xml:id="c1.4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
               <head>The Party</head>
               <p>OUR party, on the fifth of November, passed off very well in spite 
of Mrs Graham's refusal to grace it with her presence. Indeed, it is 
probable that, had she been there, there would have been less 
cordiality, freedom, and frolic amongst us than there was without 
her. 
</p>
               <p>My mother, as usual, was cheerful and chatty, full of activity and 
good nature, and only faulty in being too anxious to make her guests 
happy, thereby forcing several of them to do what their soul 
abhorred, in the way of eating or drinking, sitting opposite the 
blazing fire, or talking when they would be silent. Nevertheless, 
they bore it very well, being all in their holiday humours. 
</p>
               <p>Mr Millward was mighty in important dogmas and sententious jokes, 
pompous anecdotes, and oracular discourses, dealt out for the 
edification of the whole assembly in general, and of the admiring 
Mrs Markham, the polite Mr Lawrence, the sedate Mary Millward, the 
quiet Richard Wilson, and the matter of fact Robert, in 
particular,—as being the most attentive listeners. 
</p>
               <p>Mrs Wilson was more brilliant than ever, with her budgets of fresh 
news and old scandal, strung together with trivial questions and 
remarks, and oft-repeated observations, uttered apparently for the 
sole purpose of denying a moment's rest to her inexhaustible organs 
of speech. She had brought her knitting with her, and it seemed as 
if her tongue had laid a wager with her fingers to outdo them in 
swift and ceaseless motion. 
</p>
               <p>Her daughter Jane was, of course, as graceful and elegant, as witty 
and seductive as she could possibly manage to be; for here were all 
the ladies to outshine, and all the gentlemen to charm,—and Mr 
Lawrence, especially, to capture and subdue. Her little arts to 
effect his subjugation were too subtle and impalpable to attract my 
observation; but I thought there was a certain refined affectation 
of superiority, and an ungenial self-consciousness about her, that 
negatived all her advantages, and after she was gone, Rose 
interpreted to me her various looks, words, and actions with a 
mingled acuteness and asperity that made me wonder, equally, at the 
lady's artifice and my sister's penetration, and ask myself if she 
too had an eye to the squire—but never mind, Halford; she had 
not. 
</p>
               <p>Richard Wilson, Jane's younger brother, sat in a corner, apparently 
good-tempered, but silent and shy, desirous to escape observation, 
but willing enough to listen and observe: and, although somewhat out 
of his element, he would have been happy enough in his own quiet 
way, if my mother could only have let him alone, hut in her mistaken 
kindness, she would keep persecuting him with her 
attentions—pressing upon him all manner of viands, under the notion 
that he was too bashful to help himself, and obliging him to shout 
across the room his monosyllabic replies to the numerous questions 
and observations by which she vainly attempted to draw him into 
conversation. 
</p>
               <p>Rose informed me that he never would have favoured us with his 
company, but for the importunities of his sister Jane, who was most 
anxious to show Mr Lawrence that she had at least one brother more 
gentlemanly and refined than Robert. That worthy individual she had 
been equally solicitous to keep away; but he affirmed that he saw no 
reason why he should not enjoy a crack with Markham and the old lady 
(my mother was not old really), and bonny Miss Rose and the parson, 
as well as the best;—and he—was in the right of it too. So he 
talked common-place with my mother and Rose, and discussed parish 
affairs with the vicar, farming matters with me, and politics with 
us both. 
</p>
               <p>Mary Millward was another mute,—not so much tormented with cruel 
kindness as Dick Wilson, because she had a certain short, decided 
way of answering and refusing, and was supposed to be rather sullen 
than diffident. However that might be, she certainly did not give 
much pleasure to the company;—nor did she appear to derive much 
from it. Eliza told me she had only come because her father insisted 
upon it, having taken it into his head that she devoted herself too 
exclusively to her household duties, to t!ie neglect of such 
relaxations and innocent enjoyments as were proper to her age and 
sex. She seemed, to me, to be good-humoured enough on the whole. 
Once or twice she was provoked laughter by the wit, or the merriment 
of some favoured individual amongst us; and then I observed she 
sought the eye of Richard Wilson, who sat over against her. As he 
studied with her father, she had some acquaintance with him, in 
spite of the retiring habits of both, and I suppose there was a kind 
of fellow-feeling established between them. 
</p>
               <p>My Eliza was charming beyond description, coquettish without 
affectation, and evidently more desirous to engage my attention than 
that of all the room besides. Her delight in having me near her, 
seated or standing by her side, whispering in her ear, or pressing 
her hand in the dance, was plainly legible in her glowing face and 
heaving bosom, however belied by saucy words and gestures. But I had 
better hold my tongue: if I boast of these things now, I shall have 
to blush hereafter. 
</p>
               <p>To proceed then, with the various individuals of our party; Rose was 
simple and natural as usual, and full of mirth and vivacity. 
</p>
               <p>Fergus was impertinent and absurd; but his impertinence and folly 
served to make others laugh, if they did not raise himself in their 
estimation. 
</p>
               <p>And finally (for I omit myself), Mr Lawrence was gentlemanly and 
inoffensive to all, and polite to the vicar and the ladies, 
especially his hostess and her daughter, and Miss Wilson—misguided 
man; he had not the taste to prefer Eliza Millward. Mr Lawrence and 
I were on tolerably intimate terms. Essentially of reserved habits, 
and but seldom quitting the secluded place of his birth, where he 
had lived in solitary state since the death of his father, he had 
neither the opportunity nor the inclination for forming many 
acquaintances; and, of all he had ever known, I (judging by the 
results) was the companion most agreeable to his taste. I liked the 
man well enough, but he was too cold, and shy, and self-contained, 
to obtain my cordial sympathies. A spirit of candour and frankness, 
when wholly unaccompanied with coarseness, he admired in others, but 
he could not acquire it himself. His excessive reserve upon all his 
own concerns was, indeed, provoking and chilly enough; but I forgave 
it, from a conviction that it originated, less in pride and want of 
confidence in his friends, than in a certain morbid feeling of 
delicacy, and a peculiar diffidence, that he was sensible of, but 
wanted energy to overcome. 
</p>
               <p>His heart was like a sensitive plant, that opens for a moment in the 
sunshine, but curls up and shrinks into itself at the slightest 
touch of the finger, or the lightest breath of wind. And, upon the 
whole, our intimacy was rather a mutual predilection than a deep and 
solid friendship, such as has since arisen between myself and you, 
Halford, whom, in spite of your occasional crustiness, I can liken 
to nothing so well as an old coat, unimpeachable in texture, but 
easy and loose—that has conformed itself to the shape of the 
wearer, and which he may use as he pleases, without being bothered 
with the fear of spoiling it;—whereas Mr Lawrence was like a new 
garment, all very neat and trim to look at, but so tight in the 
elbows that you would fear to split the seams by the unrestricted 
motion of your arms, and so smooth and fine in surface that you 
scruple to expose it to a single drop of rain. 
</p>
               <p>Soon after the arrival of the guests, my mother mentioned Mrs 
Graham, regretted she was not there to meet them, and explained to 
the Millwards and Wilsons the reasons she had given for neglecting 
to return their calls, hoping they would excuse her, as she was sure 
she did not mean to be uncivil, and would be glad to see them at any 
time;— 
</p>
               <p>`But she is a very singular lady, Mr Lawrence,' added she; `we don't 
know what to make of her—but I dare say you can tell us something 
about her; for she is your tenant, you know,—and she said she knew 
you a little.' 
</p>
               <p>All eyes were turned to Mr Lawrence. I thought he looked 
unnecessarily confused at being so appealed to. 
</p>
               <p>`I, Mrs Markham!' said he, `you are mistaken—I don't—that is—I 
have seen her certainly; but I am the last person you should apply 
to for information respecting Mrs Graham.' 
</p>
               <p>He then immediately turned to Rose, and asked her to favour the 
company with a song, or a tune on the piano. 
</p>
               <p>`No,' said she; `you must ask Miss Wilson: she outshines us all in 
singing, and music too.' 
</p>
               <p>Miss Wilson demurred. 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>She'll</hi> sing readily enough,' said Fergus, `if you'll 
undertake to stand by her, Mr Lawrence, and turn over the leaves for 
her.' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall be most happy to do so. Miss Wilson, will you allow me?' 
</p>
               <p>She bridled her long neck and smiled, and suffered him to lead her 
to the instrument, where she played and sang, in her very best 
style, one piece after another; while he stood patiently by, leaning 
one hand on the back of her chair, and turning over the leaves of 
her book with the other. Perhaps he was as much charmed with her 
performance as she was. It was all very fine in its way; but I 
cannot say that it moved me very deeply. There was plenty of skill 
and execution, but precious little feeling. 
</p>
               <p>But we had not done with Mrs Graham yet. 
</p>
               <p>`I don't take wine, Mrs Markham,' said Mr Millward, upon the 
introduction of that beverage; `I'll take a little of your 
home-brewed ale. I always prefer your home-brewed to anything 
else.' 
</p>
               <p>Flattered at this compliment, my mother rang the bell, and a china 
jug of our best ale was presently brought, and set before the worthy 
gentleman who so well knew how to appreciate its excellencies. 
</p>
               <p>`Now THIS is the thing!' cried he, pouring out a glass of the same 
in a long stream, skilfully directed from the jug to the tumbler, so 
as to produce much foam without spilling a drop; and, having 
surveyed it for a moment opposite the candle, he took a deep 
draught, and then smacked his lips, drew a long breath, and refilled 
his glass, my mother looking on with the greatest satisfaction. 
</p>
               <p>`There's nothing like this, Mrs Markham!' said he; `I always 
maintain that there's nothing to compare with your home-brewed 
ale.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm sure I'm glad you like it, sir. I always look after the brewing 
myself, as well as the cheese and the butter—I like to have things 
well done, while we're about it.' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>Quite right</hi>, Mrs Markham!' 
</p>
               <p>`But then, Mr Millward, you don't think it wrong to take a little 
wine now and then—or a little spirits either?' said my mother, as 
she handed a smoKing tumbler of gin and water to Mrs Wilson, who 
affirmed that wine sat heavy on her stomach, and whose son Robert 
was at that moment helping himself to a pretty stiff glass of the 
same. 
</p>
               <p>`By no means!' replied the oracle, with a Jove-like nod; `these 
things are all blessings and mercies, if we only knew how to make 
use of them.' 
</p>
               <p>`But Mrs Graham doesn't think so. You shall just hear now, what she 
told us the other day—I <hi>told</hi> her I'd tell you.' 
</p>
               <p>And my mother favoured the company with a particular account of that 
lady's mistaken ideas and conduct regarding the matter in hand, 
concluding with, `Now don't you think it is wrong?' 
</p>
               <p>`Wrong!' repeated the vicar, with more than common 
solemnity—`criminal, I should say—criminal!—Not only is it making 
a fool of the boy, but it is despising the gifts of providence, and 
teaching him to trample them under his feet.' 
</p>
               <p>He then entered more fully into the question, and explained at large 
the folly and impiety of such a proceeding. My mother heard him with 
profoundest reverence; and even Mrs Wilson vouchsafed to rest her 
tongue for a moment, and listen in silence, while she complacently 
sipped her gin and water. Mr Lawrence sat with his elbow on the 
table, carelessly playing with his half-empty wine-glass, and 
covertly smiling to himself. 
</p>
               <p>`But don't you think, Mr Millward,' suggested he, when at length 
that gentleman paused in his discourse, `that when a child may be 
naturally prone to intemperance—by the fault of its parents or 
ancestors, for instance—some precautions are advisable?' (Now it 
was generally believed that Mr Lawrence's father had shortened his 
days by intemperance.) 
</p>
               <p>`Some precautions, it may be; but temperance, sir, is one thing, and 
abstinence another.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I have heard that, with some persons, temperance—that is 
moderation—is almost impossible; and if abstinence be an evil 
(which some have doubted), no one will deny that excess is a 
greater. Some parents have entirely prohibited their children from 
tasting intoxicating liquors; but a parent's authority cannot list 
for ever: children are naturally prone to hanker after forbidden 
things; and a child, in such a case, would be likely to have a 
strong curiosity to taste, and try the effect of what has been so 
lauded and enjoyed by others, so strictly forbidden to 
himself—which curiosity would generally be gratified on the first 
convenient opportunity; and the restraint once broken, serious 
consequences might ensue. I don't pretend to be a judge of such 
matters, but it seems to me, that this plan of Mrs Graham's, as you 
describe it, Mrs Markham, extraordinary as it may be, is not without 
its advantages; for here you see, the child is delivered at once 
from temptation; he has no secret curiosity, no hankering desire; he 
is as well acquainted with the tempting liquors as he ever wishes to 
be; and is thoroughly disgusted with them without having suffered 
from their effects.' 
</p>
               <p>`And is that right, sir?' Have I not proven to you how wrong it 
is—how contrary to Scripture and to reason to teach a child to look 
with contempt and disgust upon the blessings of providence, instead 
of to use them aright?' 
</p>
               <p>`You may consider laudanum a blessing of providence, sir,' replied 
Mr Lawrence, smiling; `and yet, you will allow that most of us had 
better abstain from it, even in moderation; but,' added he, `I would 
not desire you to follow out my simile too closely—in witness 
whereof I finish my glass.' 
</p>
               <p>`And take another I hope, Mr Lawrence,' said my mother, pushing the 
bottle towards him. 
</p>
               <p>He politely declined, and pushing his chair a little way from the 
table, leant back towards me—I was seated a trifle behind, on the 
sofa beside Eliza Millward—and carelessly asked me if I knew Mrs 
Graham. 
</p>
               <p>`I have met her once or twice,' I replied. `What do you think of 
her?' 
</p>
               <p>`I cannot say that I like her much. She is handsome—or rather I 
should say distinguished and interesting—in her appearance, but by 
no means amiable—a woman liable to take strong prejudices, I should 
fancy, and stick to them through thick and thin, twisting everything 
into conformity with her own preconceived opinions—too hard, too 
sharp, too bitter for my taste.' 
</p>
               <p>He made no reply, but looked down and bit his lip, and shortly after 
rose and sauntered up to Miss Wilson, as much repelled by me, I 
fancy, as attracted by her. I scarcely noticed it at the time, but 
afterwards, I was led to recall this and other trifling facts, of a 
similar nature, to my remembrance, when—but I must not 
anticipate. 
</p>
               <p>We wound up the evening with dancing—our worthy pastor thinking it 
no scandal to be present on the occasion, though one of the village 
musicians was engaged to direct our evolutions' with his violin. But 
Mary Millward obstinately refused to join us; and so did Richard 
Wilson, though my mother earnestly entreated him to do so, and even 
offered to be his partner. 
</p>
               <p>We managed very well without them, however. With a single set of 
quadrilles, and several country dances, we carried it on to a pretty 
late hour; and at length, having called upon our musician to strike 
up a waltz, I was just about to whirl Eliza round in that delightful 
dance, accompanied by Lawrence and Jane Wilson, and Fergus and Rose, 
when Mr Millward interposed with,— 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, I don't allow that! Come, it's time to be going now.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no, papal' pleaded Eliza. 
</p>
               <p>`High time, my girl—high time!—Moderation in all things, remember! 
That's the plan—“let your moderation be known unto all men”!'5 
</p>
               <p>But in revenge, I followed Eliza into the dimly-lighted passage, 
where under pretence of helping her on with her shawl, I fear I must 
plead guilty to snatching a kiss behind her father's back, while he 
was enveloping his throat and chin in the folds of a mighty 
comforter. But alas! in turning round, there was my mother close 
beside me. The consequence was, that no sooner were the guests 
departed, than I was doomed to a very serious remonstrance, which 
unpleasantly checked the galloping course of my spirits, and made a 
disagreeable close to the evening. 
</p>
               <p>`My dear Gilbert,' said she, `I wish you wouldn't do so! You know 
how deeply I have your advantage at heart, how I love you and prize 
you above everything else in the world, and how much I long to see 
you well settled in life—and how bitterly it would grieve me to see 
you married to that girl—or any other in the neighbourhood. What 
you see in her I don't know. It isn't only the want of money that I 
think about—nothing of the kind—but there's neither beauty, nor 
cleverness, nor goodness, nor anything else that's desirable. If you 
knew your own value as I do, you wouldn't dream of it. Do wait 
awhile and see! if you bind yourself to her, you'll repent it all 
your lifetime when you look round you and see how many better there 
are. Take my word for it, you will.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, mother, do be quiet!—I hate to be lectured!—I'm not going 
to marry yet, I tell you; but—dear me! mayn't I enjoy myself at 
<hi>all</hi>?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, my dear boy, but not in that way. Indeed you shouldn't do such 
things. You would be wronging the girl, if she were what she ought 
to be; but I assure you she is as artful a little hussy as anybody 
need wish to see; and you'll get entangled in her snares before you 
know where you are. And if you <hi>do</hi> marry her Gilbert, you'll 
break my heart—so there's an end of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, don't cry about it, mother,' said I, for the tears were 
gushing from her eyes; `there, let that kiss efface the one I gave 
Eliza; don't abuse her any more, and set your mind at rest; for I'll 
promise never to—that is, I'll promise to—to think twice before I 
take any important step you seriously disapprove of.' 
</p>
               <p>So saying, I lighted my candle, and went to bed, considerably 
quenched in spirit. 
</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V</head>
               <head>The Studio</head>
               <p>IT was about the close of the month, that, yielding at length to the 
urgent importunities of Rose, I accompanied her in a visit to 
Wildfell Hall. To our surprise, we were ushered into a room where 
the first object that met the eye was a painter's easel, with a 
table beside it covered with rolls of canvas, bottles of oil and 
varnish, palette, brushes, paints, etc. Leaning against the wall 
were several sketches in various stages of progression, and a few 
finished paintings mostly of landscapes and figures. 
</p>
               <p>`I must make you welcome to my studio,' said Mrs Graham; `there is 
no fire in the sitting-room to-day, and it is rather too cold to 
show you into a place with an empty grate.' 
</p>
               <p>And disengaging a couple of chairs from the artistical lumber that 
usurped them, she bid us be seated, and resumed her place beside the 
easel—not facing it exactly, but now and then glancing at the 
picture upon it while she conversed, and giving it an occasional 
touch with her brush, as if she found it impossible to wean her 
attention entirely from her occupation to fix it upon her guests. It 
was a view of Wildfell Hall, as seen at early morning from the field 
below, rising in dark relief against a sky of clear silvery blue, 
with a few red streaks on the horizon, faithfully drawn and 
coloured, and very elegantly and artistically handled. 
</p>
               <p>`I see your heart is in your work, Mrs Graham,' observed I: `I must 
beg you to go on with it; for if you suffer our presence to 
interrupt you, we shall be constrained to regard ourselves as 
unwelcome intruders.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no!'. replied she, throwing her brush on to the table, as if 
startled into politeness. `I am not so beset with visitors, but that 
I can readily spare a few minutes to the few that do favour me with 
their company. 
</p>
               <p>`You have almost completed your painting,' said I, approaching to 
observe it more closely, and surveying it with a greater degree of 
admiration and delight than I cared to express. `A few more touches 
in the foreground will finish it I should think.—But why have you 
called it Fernley Manor, Cumberland, instead of Wildfell 
Hall,—shire?' I asked, alluding to the name she had traced in small 
characters at the bottom of the canvas. 
</p>
               <p>But immediately I was sensible of having committed an act of 
impertinence in so doing; for she coloured and hesitated; but after 
a moment's pause, with a kind of desperate frankness, she 
replied,— 
</p>
               <p>`Because I have friends—acquaintances at least—in the world, from 
whom I desire my present abode to be concealed; and as they might 
see the picture, and might possibly recognize the style in spite of 
the false initials I have put in the corner, I take the precaution 
to give a false name to the place also, in order to put them on a 
wrong scent, if they should attempt to trace me out by it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you don't intend to keep the picture?' said I, anxious to say 
anything to change the subject. 
</p>
               <p>`No; I cannot afford to paint for my own amusement.' 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma sends all her pictures to London,' said Arthur; `and somebody 
sells them for her there, and sends us the money.' 
</p>
               <p>In looking round upon the other pieces, I remarked a pretty sketch 
of Lindenhope from the top of the hill; another view of the old 
hall, basking in the sunny haze of a quiet summer afternoon; and a 
simple but striking little picture of a child brooding with looks of 
silent, but deep and sorrow over handful o~ withered Bowers, with 
glimpses of dark low hills and autumnal fields behind it, and a dull 
beclouded sky above. 
</p>
               <p>`You see there is a sad dearth of subjects,' observed the fair 
artist. `I took the old hall once on a moonlight night, and I 
suppose I must take it again on a snowy winter's day, and then again 
on a dark cloudy evening; for I really have nothing else to paint. I 
have been told that you have a fine view of the sea somewhere in the 
neighbourhood—Is it true?—and is it within walking distance?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, if you don't object to walking four miles,—or nearly 
so—little short of eight miles there and back—and over a somewhat 
rough, fatiguing road.' 
</p>
               <p>`In what direction does it lie?' 
</p>
               <p>I described the situation as well as I could, and was entering upon 
an explanation of the various roads, lanes, and fields to be 
traversed in order to reach it, the goings straight on, and turnings 
to the right, and the left, when she checked me with,— 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, stop!—don't tell me now: I shall forget every word of your 
directions before I require them. I shall not think about going till 
next spring; and then, perhaps, I may trouble you. At present we 
have the winter before us, and—' 
</p>
               <p>She suddenly paused, with a suppressed exclamation, started up from 
her seat, and saying, `Excuse me one moment,' hurried from the room, 
and shut the door behind her. 
</p>
               <p>Curious to see what had startled her so, I looked towards the 
window,—for her eyes had been carelessly fixed upon it the moment 
before—and just beheld the skirts of a man's coat vanishing behind 
a large holly bush that stood between the window and the porch. 
</p>
               <p>`It's mamma's friend,' said Arthur. 
</p>
               <p>Rose and I looked at each other. 
</p>
               <p>`I don't know what to make of her, at all,' whispered Rose. 
</p>
               <p>The child looked at her in grave surprise. She straightway began to 
talk to him on indifferent matters, while I amused myself with 
looking at the pictures. There was one in an obscure comer that I 
had not before observed. It was a little child, seated on the grass 
with its lap full of flowers. The tiny features and large, blue 
eyes, smiling through a shock of light brown curls, shaken over the 
forehead as it bent above its treasure, bore sufficient resemblance 
to those of the young gentleman before me, to proclaim it a portrait 
of Arthur Graham in his early infancy. 
</p>
               <p>In taking this up to bring it to the light, I discovered another 
behind it, with its face to the wall. I ventured to take that up 
too. It was the portrait of a gentleman in the full prime of 
youthful manhood—handsome enough, and not badly executed; but, if 
done by the same hand as the others, it was evidently some years 
before; for there was far more careful minuteness of detail, and 
less of that freshness of colouring and freedom of handling, that 
delighted and surprised me in them. Nevertheless, I surveyed it with 
considerable interest. There was a certain individuality in the 
features and expression that stamped it, at once, a successful 
likeness. The bright, blue eyes regarded the spectator with a kind 
of lurking drollery—you almost expected to see them wink; the 
lips—a little too voluptuously full—seemed ready to break into a 
smile; the warmly tinted cheeks were embellished with a luxuriant 
growth of reddish whiskers; while the bright chestnut hair, 
clustering in abundant, wavy curls, trespassed too much upon the 
forehead, and seemed to intimate that the owner thereof was prouder 
of his beauty than his intellect—as perhaps, he had reason to 
be;—and yet he looked no fool. 
</p>
               <p>I had not had the portrait in my hands two minutes before the fair 
artist returned. 
</p>
               <p>`Only someone come about the pictures,' said she, in apology for her 
abrupt departure: `I told him to wait.' 
</p>
               <p>`I fear it will be considered an act of impertinence,' said I, `to 
presume to look at a picture that the artist has turned to the wall; 
but may I ask'— 
</p>
               <p>`It is an act of very great impertinence, sir; and therefore, I beg 
you will ask nothing about it, for your curiosity will not be 
gratified,' replied she, attempting to cover the tartness of her 
rebuke with a smile;—but I could see, by her flushed cheek and 
kindling eye, that she was seriously annoyed. 
</p>
               <p>`I was only going to ask if you had painted it yourself,' said I, ~y 
resigning the picture into her hands; for without a grain of 
ceremony, she took it from me; and quickly restoring it to the dark 
corner, with its face to the wall, placed the other against it as 
before, and then turned to me and laughed. 
</p>
               <p>But I was in no humour for jesting. I carelessly turned to the 
window, and stood looking out upon the desolate garden, leaving her 
to talk to Rose for a minute or two; and then, telling my sister it 
was time to go, shook hands with the little gentleman, coolly bowed 
to the lady, and moved towards the door. But, having bid adieu to 
Rose, Mrs Graham presented her hand to me, saying, with a soft 
voice, and by no means a disagreeable smile,— 
</p>
               <p>`Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, Mr Markham. I'm sorry I 
offended you by my abruptness.' 
</p>
               <p>When a lady condescends to apologize, there is no keeping one's 
anger of course; so we parted good friends for once; and this time, 
I squeezed her hand with a cordial, not a spiteful pressure. 
</p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="c1.6" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
               <head>Progression</head>
               <p>During the next four months, I did not enter Mrs Graham's house, nor 
she mine; but still the ladies continued to talk about her, and 
still our acquaintance continued, though slowly, to advance. As for 
their talk, I paid but little attention to that (when it related to 
the fair hermit, I mean), and the only information I derived from it 
was that, one fine, frosty day, she had ventured to take her little 
boy as far as the vicarage, and that, unfortunately, nobody was at 
home but Miss Millward; I nevertheless, she had sat a long time, 
and, by all accounts, they had found a good deal to say to each 
other, and parted with a mutual desire to meet again.—But Mary 
liked children, and fond mammas like those who can duly appreciate 
their treasures. 
</p>
               <p>But sometimes I saw her myself,—not only when she came to church, 
but when she was out on the hills with her son, whether taking a 
long, purpose-like walk, or—on special fine days—leisurely 
rambling over the moor or the bleak pasture-lands surrounding the 
old hall, herself with a book in her hand, her son gambolling about 
her; and, on any of these occasions, when I caught sight of her in 
my solitary walks or rides, or while following my agricultural 
pursuits, I generally contrived to meet or overtake her; for I 
rather liked to see Mrs Graham, and to talk to her, and I decidedly 
liked to talk to her little companion, whom, when once the ice of 
his shyness was fairly broken, I found to be a very amiable, 
intelligent, and entertaining little fellow; and we soon became 
excellent friends—how much to the gratification of his mamma, I 
cannot undertake to say. I suspected at first, that she was desirous 
of throwing cold water on this growing intimacy—to quench, as it 
were, the kindling flame of our friendship—but discovering, at 
length, in spite of her prejudice against me, that I was perfectly 
harmless, and even well-intentioned, and that, between myself and my 
dog, her son derived a great deal of pleasure from the acquaintance, 
that he would not otherwise have known, she ceased to object, and 
even welcomed my coming with a smile. 
</p>
               <p>As for Arthur, he would shout his welcome from afar, and run to meet 
me fifty yards from his mother's side. If I happened to be on 
horseback, he was sure to get a canter or a gallop; or, if there was 
one of the draught horses within an available distance, he was 
treated to a steady ride upon that, which served his turn almost as 
well; but his mother would always follow and trudge beside him—not 
so much, I believe, to ensure his safe conduct, as to see that I 
instilled no objectionable notions into his infant mind; for she was 
ever on the watch, and never would allow him to be taken out of her 
sight. What pleased her best of all, was to see him romping and 
racing with Sancho, while I walked by her side—not, I fear, for 
love of my company (though I sometimes deluded myself with that 
idea), so much as for the delight she took in seeing her son thus 
happily engaged in the enjoyment of those active sports, so 
invigorating to his tender frame, yet so seldom exercised for want 
of playmates suited to his years; and, perhaps, her pleasure was 
sweetened, not a little, by the fact of my being with <hi>her</hi>
instead of with <hi>him</hi>; and therefore incapable of doing him any 
injury, directly or indirectly, designedly or otherwise—small 
thanks to her for that same. 
</p>
               <p>But sometimes, I believe, she really had some little gratification 
in conversing with me; and one bright February morning, during 
twenty minutes' stroll along the moor, she laid aside her usual 
asperity and reserve, and fairly entered into conversation with me, 
discoursing with so much eloquence, and depth of thought and 
feeling, on a subject, happily coinciding with my own ideas, and 
looking so beautiful with all that I went home enchanted; and on the 
way (morally) started to find myself thinking that, after all, it 
would, perhaps, be better to spend one's days with such a woman than 
with Eliza Millward;—and then I (figuratively) blushed for my 
inconstancy. 
</p>
               <p>On entering the parlour, I found Eliza there, with Rose and no one 
else. The surprise was not altogether so agreeable as it ought to 
have been. We chatted together a long time; but I found her rather 
frivolous, and even a little insipid, compared with the more mature 
and earnest Mrs Graham—Alas, for human constancy! 
</p>
               <p>`However,' thought I, `I ought not to marry Eliza since my mother so 
strongly objects to it, and I ought not to delude the girl with the 
idea that I intended to do so. Now, if this mood continue, I shall 
have less difficulty in emancipating my affections from her soft, 
yet unrelenting sway; and, though Mrs Graham might be equally 
objectionable, I may be permitted, like the doctors, to cure a 
greater evil by a less; for I shall not fall seriously in love with 
the young widow, I think,—nor she with me—that's certain—but if I 
find a little pleasure in her society, I may surely be allowed to 
seek it; and if the star of her divinity be bright enough to dim the 
lustre of Eliza's, so much the better; but I scarcely can think 
it.' 
</p>
               <p>And thereafter, I seldom suffered a fine day to pass without paying 
a visit to Wildfell, about the time my new acquaintance usually left 
her hermitage; but so frequently was I balked in my expectations of 
another interview, so changeable was she in her times of coming 
forth, and in her places of resort, so transient were the occasional 
glimpses I was able to obtain, that I felt half inclined to think 
she took as much pains to avoid my company, as I to seek hers; but 
this was too disagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment 
after it could, conveniently, be bed. 
</p>
               <p>One calm, clear afternoon, however, in March, as I was 
superintending the rolling of the meadow-land, and the repairing of 
a hedge in the valley, I saw Mrs Graham down by the brook, with a 
sketch-book in her hand, absorbed in the exercise of her favourite 
art, while Arthur was putting on the time with constructing dams and 
breakwaters in the shallow, stony stream. I was rather in want of 
amusement, and so rare an opportunity was not to be neglected; so, 
leaving both meadow and hedge, I quickly repaired to the spot,—but 
not before Sancho, who, immediately upon perceiving his young 
friend, scoured at full gallop the intervening space, and pounced 
upon him with an impetuous mirth that precipitated the child almost 
into the middle of the beck; but, happily, the stones preserved him 
from any serious wetting, while their smoothness prevented his being 
too much hurt to laugh at the untoward event. 
</p>
               <p>Mrs Graham was studying the distinctive characters of the different 
varieties of trees in their winter nakedness, and copying, with a 
spirited, though delicate touch, their various ramifications. She 
did not talk much; but I stood and watched the progress of her 
pencil: it was a pleasure to behold it so dexterously guided by 
those fair and graceful fingers. But erelong their dexterity became 
impaired, they began to hesitate, to tremble slightly, and make 
false strokes, and then suddenly came to a pause, while their owner 
laughingly raised her face to mine, and told me that her sketch did 
not profit by my superintendence. 
</p>
               <p>`Then,' said I, `I'll talk to Arthur, till you've done.' 
</p>
               <p>`I should like to have a ride, Mr Markham, if Mamma will let me,' 
said the child. 
</p>
               <p>`What on, my boy?' 
</p>
               <p>`I think there's a horse in that field,' replied he, sting to where 
the strong black mare was pulling the roller. 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, Arthur; it's too far,' objected his mother. 
</p>
               <p>But I promised to bring him safe back, after a turn or two up and 
down the meadow; and when she looked at his eager face, she smiled 
and let him go. It was the first time she had even allowed me to 
take him so much as half a field's length from her side. 
</p>
               <p>Enthroned upon his monstrous steed, and solemnly proceeding up and 
down the wide, steep field, he looked the very incarnation of quiet, 
gleeful satisfaction and delight. The rolling, however, was soon 
completed; but when I dismounted the gallant horn man, and restored 
him to his mother, she seemed rather displeased at my keeping him so 
long. She had shut up her sketch-book, and been, probably for some 
minutes, impatiently waiting his return. 
</p>
               <p>It was now high time to go home, she said, and would have bid me 
good evening; but I was not going to leave her yet: I accompanied 
her half-way up the hill. She became more sociable; and I was 
beginning to be very happy; but, on coming within sight of the grim 
old hall, she stood still and turned towards me while she spoke, as 
if expecting I should go no further, that the conversation would end 
here, and I should now take leave and depart—as, indeed, it was 
time to do; for `the clear, cold eve' was fast `declining,' the sun 
had set, and the gibbous moon was visibly brightening in the pale 
grey sky; but a feeling almost of compassion riveted me to the 
 spot. It seemed hard to leave her to such a lonely, comfortless 
 home. I looked up at it. Silent and grim it frowned before us. A 
 faint, red light was gleaming from the lower windows of one wing; 
but all the other windows were in darkness, 
and many exhibited their black, cavernous gulfs, entirely destitute of glazing or framework.
</p>
<p>‘Do you not find it a desolate place to live in?’ said I, after a moment of silent contemplation.
</p>
<p>‘I do, sometimes,’ replied she.  ‘On winter evenings, when Arthur is in bed, and I am sitting there alone, hearing the bleak wind moaning round me and howling through the ruinous old chambers, no books or occupations can repress the dismal thoughts and apprehensions that come crowding in—but it is folly to give way to such weakness, I know.  If Rachel is satisfied with such a life, why should not I?—Indeed, I cannot be too thankful for such an asylum, while it is left me.’
</p>
<p>The closing sentence was uttered in an undertone, as if spoken rather to herself than to me.  She then bid me good-evening and withdrew.
</p>
<p>I had not proceeded many steps on my way homewards when I perceived Mr. Lawrence, on his pretty grey pony, coming up the rugged lane that crossed over the hill-top.  I went a little out of my way to speak to him; for we had not met for some time.
</p>
<p>‘Was that Mrs. Graham you were speaking to just now?’ said he, after the first few words of greeting had passed between us.
</p>
<p>‘Yes.’
</p>
<p>‘Humph!  I thought so.’  He looked contemplatively at his horse’s mane, as if he had some serious cause of dissatisfaction with it, or something else.
</p>
<p>‘Well! what then?’
</p>
<p>‘Oh, nothing!’ replied he.  ‘Only I thought you disliked her,’ he quietly added, curling his classic lip with a slightly sarcastic smile.
</p>
<p>‘Suppose I did; mayn’t a man change his mind on further acquaintance?’
</p>
<p>‘Yes, of course,’ returned he, nicely reducing an entanglement in the pony’s redundant hoary mane.  Then suddenly turning to me, and fixing his shy, hazel eyes upon me with a steady penetrating gaze, he added, ‘Then you have changed your mind?’
</p>
<p>‘I can’t say that I have exactly.  No; I think I hold the same opinion respecting her as before—but slightly ameliorated.’
</p>
<p>‘Oh!’  He looked round for something else to talk about; and glancing up at the moon, made some remark upon the beauty of the evening, which I did 
 not answer, as being irrelevant to the subject. 
</p>
               <p>`Lawrence,' said I, calmly looking him in the face, `are you in love 
with Mrs Graham?' 
</p>
               <p>Instead of his being deeply offended at this, as I more than half 
expected he would, the first start of surprise, at the audacious 
question, was followed by a tittering laugh, as if he was highly 
amused at the idea. 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>I</hi> in love with her!' repeated he. `What makes you dream of 
such a thing?' 
</p>
               <p>`From the interest you take in the progress of my acquaintance with 
the lady, and the changes of my opinion concerning her, I thought 
you might be jealous.' 
</p>
               <p>He laughed again. `Jealous! no—But I thought you were going to 
marry Eliza Millward.' 
</p>
               <p>`You thought wrong then; I am not going to marry either one or the 
other—that I know of.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then I think you'd better let them alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you going to marry Jane Wilson?' 
</p>
               <p>He coloured, and played with the mane again, but answered,— 
</p>
               <p>`No, I think not.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you had better let her alone.' 
</p>
               <p>She won't let me alone—he might have said; but he only looked silly 
and said nothing for the space of half a minute, and then made 
another attempt to turn the conversation; and, this time, I let it 
pass; for he had borne enough: another word on the subject would 
have been like the last atom that breaks the camel's back. 
</p>
               <p>I was too late for tea; but my mother had kindly kept the teapot and 
muffin warm upon the hobs, and, though she scolded me a little, 
readily admitted my excuses; and when I complained of the flavour of 
the overdrawn tea, she poured the remainder into the slop-basin, and 
bade Rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle, which 
offices were performed with great commotion and certain remarkable 
comments:— 
</p>
               <p>`Well!—if it had been <hi>me</hi> now, I should have had no tea at 
all—If it had been Fergus, even, he would have had to put up with 
such as there was, and been told to be thankful, for it was far too 
good for him; but yoU—we can't do too much for <hi>you</hi>—It's 
always so—if there's anything particularly rice at table, mamma 
winks and nods at me to abstain from it, and if I don't attend to 
that, she whispers, “Don't eat so much of that, Rose, Gilbert will 
like it for his supper”—<hi>I'm</hi> nothing at all—in the parlour, 
it's “Come, Rose, put away your things, and let's have the room nice 
and tidy against they come in; and keep up a good fire; Gilbert 
likes a cheerful fire.” In the kitchen—“Make that pie a large one, 
Rose, I dare say the boys'll be hungry;—and don't put so much 
pepper in, they'll not like it I'm sure”—or, “Rose, don't put so 
many spices in the pudding, Gilbert likes it plain,”—or, “Mind you 
put plenty of currants in the cake, Fergus likes plenty.” If I say, 
“Well, mamma, I don't,” I'm told I ought not to think of 
myself—“You know, Rose, in all household matters, we have only two 
things to consider, first, what's proper to be done, and secondly, 
what's most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house—anything will 
do for the ladies.”' 
</p>
               <p>`And very good doctrine too,' said my mother. `Gilbert so, I'm 
sure.' 
</p>
               <p>`Very convenient doctrine, for us at all events,' said I; `but if 
you would really study my pleasure, mother, you must consider your 
own comfort and convenience a little more than you do—as for Rose, 
I have no doubt she'll take care of herself; and whenever she does 
make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness, she'll 
take good care to let me know the extent of it. But for you, I might 
sink into the grossest condition of self-indulgence and carelessness 
about the wants of others, from the mere habit of being constantly 
cared for myself, and having all my wants anticipated or immediately 
supplied, while left in total ignorance of what is done for me,—if 
Rose did not enlighten me now and then; and I should receive all 
your kindness as a matter of course, and never know how much I owe 
you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! and you never <hi>will</hi> know, Gilbert, till you're married. 
Then, when you've got some trifling, self-conceited girl like Eliza 
Millward, careless of everything but her own immediate pleasure and 
advantage, or some misguided, obstinate woman like Mrs Graham, 
ignorant of her principal duties, and clever only in what concerns 
her least to know—then, you'll find the difference.' 
</p>
               <p>`It will do me good, mother; I was not sent into the world merely to 
exercise the good capacities and good feelings of others—was 
I?—but to exert my own towards them; and when I marry, I shall 
expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and 
comfortable, than in being made so by her: I would rather give than 
receive.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! that's all nonsense, my dear—It's mere boy's talk that! You'll 
soon tire of petting and humouring your wife, be she ever so 
charming, and <hi>then</hi> comes the trial.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, then, we must bear one another's burdens.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then, you must fall each into your proper place. You'll do your 
business, and she, if she's worthy of you, will do hers; but it's 
your business to please yourself, and hers to please you. I'm sure 
your poor, dear father was as good a husband as ever lived, and 
after the first six months or so were over, I should as soon have 
expected him to fly, as to put himself out of his way to pleasure 
me. He always said I was a good wife, and did my duty; and he always 
did his—bless him!—he was steady and punctual, seldom found fault 
without a reason, always did justice to my good dinners, and hardly 
ever spoiled my cookery by delay—and that's as much as any woman 
can expect of any man.' 
</p>
               <p>Is it so, Halford? Is that the extent of your domestic virtues; and 
does your happy wife exact no more?

               <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
               <head>The Excursion</head>
               <p>NOT many days after this, on a mild sunny morning—rather soft under 
foot; for the last fall of snow was only just wasted away, leaving 
yet a thin ridge, here and there, lingering on the fresh, green 
grass beneath the hedges; but beside them already, the young 
primroses were peeping from among their moist, dark foliage, and the 
lark above was singing of summer, and hope, and love, and every 
heavenly thing—I was out on the hill-side, enjoying these delights, 
and looking after the wellbeing of my young lambs and their mothers, 
when, on glancing round me, I beheld three persons ascending from 
the vale below. They were Eliza Millward, Fergus, and Rose; so I 
crossed the field to meet them; and, being told they were going to 
Wildfell Hall, I declared myself willing to go with them, and 
offering my arm to Eliza, who readily accepted it in lieu of my 
brother's, told the latter he might go back, for I would accompany 
the ladies. 
</p>
               <p>`I beg <hi>your</hi> pardon!' exclaimed he—`It's the ladies that are 
accompanying me, not I them. You had all had a peep at this 
wonderful stranger, but me, and I could endure my wretched ignorance 
no longer—come what would, I must be satisfied; so I begged Rose to 
go with me to the hall, and introduce me to her at once. She swore 
she would not, unless Miss Eliza would go too; so I ran to the 
vicarage and fetched her; and we've come hooked all the way, as fond 
as a pair of lovers—and now you've taken her from me; and you want 
to deprive me of my walk and my visit besides—Go back to your 
fields and your cattle, you lubberly fellow; you're not fit to 
associate with ladies and gentlemen, like us, that have nothing to 
do but to run snooking about to our neighbours' houses, peeping into 
their private corners; and scenting out their secrets, and picking 
holes in their coats, when we don't find them ready made to our 
hands—you don't understand such refined sources of enjoyment.' 
</p>
               <p>`Can't you both go?' suggested Eliza, disregarding the latter half 
of the speech. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, both to be sure!' cried Rose; `the more the merrier—and I'm 
sure we shall want all the cheerfulness we can carry with us to that 
great, dark, gloomy room, with its narrow latticed windows, and its 
dismal old furniture—unless she shows us into her studio again.' 
</p>
               <p>So we went all in a body; and the meagre old maidservant, that 
opened the door, ushered us into an apartment, such as Rose had 
described to me as the scene of her first introduction to Mrs 
Graham, a tolerably spacious and lofty room, but obscurely lighted 
by the old-fashioned windows, the ceiling, panels, and chimney-piece 
of grim black oak—the latter elaborately, but not very tastefully 
carved,—with tables and chairs to match, an old bookcase on one 
side of the fireplace, stocked with a motley assemblage of books, 
and an elderly cabinet piano on the other. 
</p>
               <p>The lady was seated in a stiff, high-backed armchair, with a small, 
round table, containing a desk and a work basket, on one side of 
her, and her little boy on the other, who stood leaning his elbow on 
her knee, and reading to her, with wonderful fluency, from a small 
volume that lay in her lap; while she rested her hand on his 
shoulder, and abstractedly played with the long, wavy curls that 
fell on his ivory neck. They struck me as forming a pleasing 
contrast to all the surrounding objects; but of course their 
position was immediately changed on our entrance; I could only 
observe the picture during the few brief seconds that Rachel held 
the door for our admittance. 
</p>
               <p>I do not think Mrs Graham was particularly delighted to see us: 
there was something indescribably chilly in her quiet, calm 
civility; but I did not talk much to her. Seating myself near the 
window, a little back from the circle, I called Arthur to me, and he 
and I, and Sancho, amused ourselves very pleasantly together, while 
the two young ladies baited his mother with small talk, and Fergus 
sat opposite, with his legs crossed, and his hands in his breeches 
pockets, leaning back in his chair, and staring now up at the 
ceiling, now `straight forward at his hostess (in a manner that made 
me strongly inclined to kick him out of the room), now whistling 
<hi>sotto voce</hi> to himself a snatch of a favourite air, now 
interrupting the conversation, or filling up a pause (as the case 
might be) with sole most impertinent question or remark. At one time 
it was— 
</p>
               <p>`It amazes me, Mrs Graham, bow you could choose such a dilapidated, 
ricketty old place as this to live in. If you couldn't afford to 
occupy the whole house, and have it mended up, why couldn't you take 
a neat little cottage?' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps I was too proud, Mr Fergus,' replied she, smiling; `perhaps 
I took a particular fancy for this romantic, old.fashioned 
place—but indeed, it has many advantages over a cottage—in the 
first place, you see, the rooms are larger and more airy; in the 
second place, the unoccupied apartments, which I don't pay for, may 
serve as lumber-rooms, if I have anything to put in them; and they 
are very useful for my little boy to run about in on rainy days when 
he can't go out; and then, there is the garden for him to play in, 
and for me to work in. You see I have effected some little 
improvement already,' continued she, turning to the window. `There 
is a bed of young vegetables in that corner, and here are some 
snowdrops and primroses already in bloom—and there, too, is a 
yellow crocus just opening in the sunshine.' 
</p>
               <p>`But then, how can you bear such a situation—your nearest 
neighbours two miles distant, and nobody looking in or passing 
by?—Rose would go stark mad in such a place. She can't put on life 
unless she sees half a dozen fresh gowns and bonnets a day—not to 
speak of the faces within; but you might sit watching at these 
windows all day long, and never see so much as an old woman carrying 
her eggs to market,' 
</p>
               <p>`I am not sure the loneliness of the place was not one of its chief 
recommendations—I take no pleasure in watching people pass the 
windows; and I like to be quiet.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! as good as to say, you wish we would all of us mind our own 
business, and let you alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I dislike an extensive acquaintance; but if I have a few 
friends, of course I am glad to see them occasionally. No one can be 
happy in eternal solitude. Therefore, Mr Fergus, if you choose to 
enter my house as a friend, I will make you welcome; if not, I must 
confess, I would rather you kept away.' She then turned and 
addressed some observation to Rose or Eliza. 
</p>
               <p>`And, Mrs Graham,' said he, again, five minutes after, `we were 
disputing, as we came along, a question that you can readily decide 
for us, as it mainly regarded yourself—and indeed, we often hold 
discussions about you; for some of us have nothing better to do than 
to talk about our neighbours' concerns, and we, the indigenous 
plants of the soil, have known each other so long, and talked each 
other over so often, that we are quite sick of that game; so that a 
stranger coming amongst us makes an invaluable addition to our 
exhausted sources of amusement, Well, the question, or questions, 
you are requested to solve—`' 
</p>
               <p>`Hold your tongue, Fergus!' cried Rose, in a fever of apprehension 
and wrath. 
</p>
               <p>`I won't, I tell you. The questions you are requested to solve are 
these:—first, concerning your birth, extraction, and previous 
residence. Some will have it that you are a foreigner, and some an 
Englishwoman; some a native of the north country, and some of the 
south; some say—`' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Mr Fergus, I'll tell you. I'm an Englishwoman—and I don't 
see why anyone should doubt it—and I was born in the country 
neither in the extreme north nor south of our happy isle; and in the 
country I have chiefly passed my life, and now, I hope, you are 
satisfied; for I am not disposed to answer any more questions at 
present.' 
</p>
               <p>`Except this—`' 
</p>
               <p>`No, not one more!' laughed she, and instantly quitting her seat, 
she sought refuge at the window by which I was seated, and, in very 
desperation, to escape my brother's persecutions, endeavoured to 
draw me into conversation. 
</p>
               <p>`Mr Markham,' said she, her rapid utterance and heightened colour 
too plainly evincing her disquietude, `have you forgotten the fine 
sea view we were speaking of some time ago? I think I must trouble 
you, now, to tell me the nearest way to it; for if this beautiful 
weather continue, I shall, perhaps, be able to walk there, and take 
my sketch; I have exhausted every other subject for painting; and I 
long to see it.' 
</p>
               <p>I was about to comply with her request; but Rose would not suffer me 
to proceed. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, don't tell her, Gilbert!' cried she; `she shall go with us. 
It's—-Bay you are thinking about, I suppose, Mrs Graham. It is a 
very long walk, too far for you, and out of the question for Arthur. 
But we were tag about making a picnic to see it, some fine day; and, 
if you will wait till the settled fine weather comes, I'm sure we 
shall all be delighted to have you amongst us.' 
</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs Graham looked dismayed, and attempted to make excuses, but 
Rose, either compassionating her lonely life, or anxious to 
cultivate her acquaintance, was determined to have her: and every 
objection was overruled, She was told it would only be a small 
party, and all friends, and that the best view of all was 
from—-cliffs, full five miles distant. 
</p>
               <p>`Just a nice walk for the gentlemen,' continued Rose; `but the 
ladies will drive and walk by turns; for we shall have our pony 
carriage, which will be plenty large enough to contain little Arthur 
and three ladies, together with your sketching apparatus, and our 
provisions.' 
</p>
               <p>So the proposal was finally acceded to; and, after some further don 
respeCting the time and manner of the projected excursion, we rose, 
and took our leave. 
</p>
               <p>But this was only March: a cold, wet April, and two weeks of May 
passed over before we could venture forth on our expedition with the 
reasonable hope of obtaining that pleasure we sought in pleasant 
prospects, cheerful society, fresh air, good cheer, and exercise, 
without the alloy of bad roads, cold winds, or threatening clouds. 
Then, on a glorious morning, we gathered our forces and set forth. 
The company consisted of Mrs and Master Graham, Mary and Eliza 
Millward, Jane and Richard Wilson, and Rose, Fergus, and Gilbert 
Markham. 
</p>
               <p>Mr Lawrence had been invited to join us, but, for some reason best 
known to himself, had refused to give us his company. I had 
solicited the favour myself. When I did so, he hesitated, and asked 
who were going. Upon my naming Miss Wilson among the rest, he seemed 
half inclined to go, but when I mentioned Mrs Graham, thinking it 
might be a further inducement, it appeared to have a contrary 
effect, and he declined it altogether, and, to confess the truth, 
the decision was not displeasing to me, though I could scarcely tell 
you why. 
</p>
               <p>It was about midday when we reached the place of our destination. 
Mrs Graham walked all the way to the cliffs; and little Arthur 
walked the greater part of it too; for he was now much more hardy 
and active, than when he first entered the neighbour hood, and he 
did not like being in the carriage with strangers, while all his 
four friends, Mamma, and Sancho, and Mr Markham, and Miss Millward, 
were on foot, journeying far behind or, passing through distant 
fields and lanes. 
</p>
               <p>I have a very pleasant recollection of that walk, along the hard, 
white, sunny road, shaded here and there with bright green trees, 
and adorned with flowery banks and blossoming hedges of delicious 
fragrance; or through pleasant fields and lab all glorious in the 
sweet flowers, and brilliant verdure of delightful May. It was true, 
Eliza was not beside me; but she was with her friends in the 
pony-carriage, as happy, I trusted, as I was; and even when we 
pedestrians, having forsaken the highway for a short cut across the 
fields, beheld the little carriage far away, disappearing amid the 
green, embowering flees, I did not hate those trees for snatching 
the dear little bonnet and shawl from my sight, nor did I feel that 
all those intervening objects lay between my happiness and me; for, 
to confess the truth, I was too happy in the company of Mrs Graham, 
to regret the absence of Eliza Millward. 
</p>
               <p>The former, it is true, was most provokingly unsociable at 
first—seemingly bent upon talking to no one but Mary Millward and 
Arthur. She and Mary journeyed along together, generally with the 
child between them;—but where the road permitted, I always walked 
on the other side of her, Richard Wilson taking the other side of 
Miss Millward, and Fergus roving here and there according to his 
fancy; and after a while, she became more friendly, and at length, I 
succeeded in securing her attention, almost entirely to myself—and 
then I was happy indeed; for whenever she did con descend to 
converse, I liked to listen. Where her opinions and sentiments 
tallied with mine, it was her extreme good sense, her exquisite 
taste and feeling that delighted me; where they differed, it was 
still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal or defence of that 
difference—her earnestness and keenness that piqued my fancy: and 
even when she angered me by her unkind words or looks, and her 
uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me the more 
dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed her, 
and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in 
her eyes, and if possible, to win her esteem. 
</p>
               <p>At length our walk was ended. The increasing height and boldness of 
the hills bad for some time intercepted the prospect: but, on 
gaining the summit of a steep acclivity, and looking downward, an 
opening lay before us—and the blue sea burst upon our sight—deep 
violet blue—not deadly calm, but covered with glinting 
breakers—diminutive white specks twinkling on its bosom, and 
scarcely to be distinguished by the keenest vision, from the little 
sea-mews that sported above, their white wings glittering in the 
sunshine: only one or two vessels were visible; and those were far 
away. 
</p>
               <p>I looked at my companion to see what she thought of this glorious 
scene. She said nothing: but she stood still, and fixed her eyes 
upon it with a gaze that assured me she was not disappointed. She 
had very fine eyes, by the by—I don't know whether I've told you 
before, but they were full of soul, large, clear, and nearly 
black—not brown, but very dark grey. A cool, reviving breeze blew 
from the sea—soft, pure, salubrious: it waved her drooping 
ringlets, and imparted a livelier colour to her usually too pallid 
lip and cheek. She felt its exhilarating influence, and so did I—I 
felt it tingling through my frame, but dared not give way to it 
while she remained so quiet. There was an aspect of subdued 
exhilaration in her face, that kindled into almost a smile of 
exalted, glad intelligence as her eye met mine. Never had she looked 
so lovely: never had my heart so warmly cleaved to her as now. Had 
we been left two minutes longer, standing there alone, I cannot 
answer for the consequences. Happily for my discretion, perhaps for 
my enjoyment during the remainder of the day, we were speedily 
summoned to the repast—a very respectable collation, which Rose, 
assisted by Miss Wilson and Eliza, who, having shared her seat in 
the carriage, had arrived with her a little before the rest, had set 
out upon an elevated platform overlooking the sea, and sheltered 
from the hot sun by a shelving rock and overhanging trees. 
</p>
               <p>Mrs Graham seated herself at a distance from me. Eliza was my 
nearest neighbour. She exerted herself to be agreeable, in her 
gentle, unobtrusive way, and was, no doubt, as fascinating and 
charming as ever, if I could only have felt it. But soon, my heart 
began to warm towards her once again; and we were all very merry and 
happy together—as far as I could see—throughout the protracted, 
social meal, 
</p>
               <p>When that was over, Rose summoned Fergus to help her to gather up 
the fragments, and the knives, dishes, etc., and restore them to the 
baskets; and Mrs Graham took her camp-tool and drawing materials; 
and having begged Miss Millward to take charge of her precious son, 
and strictly enjoined him not to wander from his new guardian's 
side, she left us and proceeded along the steep, stony hill, to a 
loftier, more precipitous eminence at some distance, whence a still 
finer prospect was to be had, where she preferred taking her sketch, 
though some of the ladies told her it was a frightful place, and 
advised her not to attempt it. 
</p>
               <p>When she was gone, I felt as if there was to be no more fun—though 
it is difficult to say what she had contributed to the hilarity of 
the party. No jests, and little laughter had escaped her lips; but 
her smile had animated my mirth, a keen observation or a cheerful 
word from her had insensibly sharpened my wits, and thrown an 
interest over all that was done and said by the rest. Even my 
conversation with Eliza, had been enlivened by her presence, though 
I knew it not; and now that she was gone, Eliza's playful nonsense 
ceased to amuse me—nay, grew wearisome to my soul, and I grew weary 
of amusing her: I felt myself drawn by an irresistible attraction to 
that distant point where the fair artist sat and plied her solitary 
task—and not long did I attempt to resist it: while my little 
neighbour was exchanging a few words with Miss Wilson, I rose and 
cannily slipped away. A few rapid strides, and a little active 
clambering, soon brought me to the place where she was seated—a 
narrow ledge of rock at the very verge of the cliff, which descended 
with a steep, precipitous shaft, quite down to the rocky shore. 
</p>
               <p>She did not hear me coming: the falling of my shadow across her 
paper gave her an electric start; and she looked hastily round—any 
other lady of my acquaintance would have screamed under such a 
sudden alarm. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! I didn't know it was you—Why did you startle me so?' said she, 
somewhat testily, `I hate anybody to come upon me so 
unexpectedly.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, what did you take me for?' said I; `if I had known you were so 
nervous, I would have been more cautious; but—`' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, never mind. What did you come for? are they all coming?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; this little ledge could scarcely contain them all,' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm glad, for I'm tired of talking.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well then, I won't talk, I'll only sit and watch your drawing.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, but you know I don't like that,' 
</p>
               <p>`Then I'll content myself with admiring this magnificent 
prospect.' 
</p>
               <p>She made no objection to this; and, for some time, sketched away in 
silence. But I could not help stealing a glance, now and then, from 
the splendid view at our feet to the elegant white hand that held 
the pencil, and the graceful neck and glossy raven curls that 
drooped over the paper. 
</p>
               <p>`Now,' thought I, `if I had but a pencil and a morsel of paper, I 
could make a lovelier sketch than hers, admitting I had the power to 
delineate faithfully what is before me.' 
</p>
               <p>But though this satisfaction was denied me, I was very well content 
to sit beside her there, and say nothing. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you there still, Mr Markham?' said she, at length, looking 
round upon me—for I was seated a little behind on a mossy 
projection of the cliff.—`Why don't you go and amuse yourself with 
your friends?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because I am tired of them, like you; and I shall have enough of 
them to-morrow—or at any time hence; but you, I may not have the 
pleasure of seeing again for I know not how long,' 
</p>
               <p>`What was Arthur doing when you came away?' 
</p>
               <p>`He was with Miss Millward where you left him—all right, but hoping 
mamma would not be long away. You didn't entrust him to me, by the 
by,' I grumbled, `though I had the honour of a much longer 
acquaintance; but Miss Millward has the art of conciliating and 
amusing children,' I carelessly added; `if she is good for nothing 
else.' 
</p>
               <p>`Miss Millward has many estimable qualities, which such as you 
cannot be expected to perceive or appreciate. Will you tell Arthur 
that I shall come in a few minutes?' 
</p>
               <p>`If that be the case, I will wait, with your permission, till those 
few minutes are past; and then I can assist you to descend this 
difficult path.' 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you—I always manage best, on such occasions, without 
assistance.' 
</p>
               <p>`But, at least, I can carry your stool and sketch-book,' 
</p>
               <p>She did not deny me this favour; but I was rather offended at her 
evident desire to be rid of me, and was beginning to repent of my 
pertinacity, when she somewhat appeased me by consulting my taste 
and judgment about some doubtful matter in her drawing. My opinion, 
happily, met her approbation, and the improvement I suggested was 
adopted without hesitation. 
</p>
               <p>`I have often wished in vain,' said she, `for another's judgment to 
appeal to when I could scarcely trust the direction of my own eye 
and head, they having been so long occupied with the contemplation 
of a single object, as to become almost incapable of forming a 
proper idea respecting it.' 
</p>
               <p>`That,' replied I, `is only one of many evils to which a solitary 
life exposes us.' 
</p>
               <p>`True,' said she; and again we relapsed into silence. 
</p>
               <p>About two minutes after, however, she declared her sketch completed 
and closed the book. 
</p>
               <p>On returning to the scene of our repast, we found all the company 
had deserted it, with the exception of three—Mary Mill ward, 
Richard Wilson, and Arthur Graham. The younger gentleman lay fast 
asleep with his head pillowed on the lady's lap; the other was 
seated beside her with a pocket edition of some classic author in 
his hand. He never went anywhere without such a companion wherewith 
to improve his leisure moments: all time seemed lost that was not 
devoted to study, or exacted, by his physical nature, for the bare 
support of life. Even now, he could not abandon himself to the 
enjoyment of that pure air and balmy sunshine—that splendid 
prospect, and those soothing sounds, the music of the waves and of 
the soft wind in the sheltering trees above him—not even with a 
lady by his side (though not a very charming one, I will allow)—he 
must pull out his book, and make the most of his time while 
digesting his temperate meal, and re posing his weary limbs, unused 
to so much exercise. 
</p>
               <p>Perhaps, however, he spared a moment to exchange a word or a glance 
with his companion now and then—at any rate, she did not appear at 
all resentful of his conduct; for her homely features wore an 
expression of unusual cheerfulness and serenity, and she was 
studying his pale, thoughtful face with great complacency when we 
arrived. 
</p>
               <p>The journey homeward was by no means so agreeable, to me, as the 
former part of the day; for now Mrs Graham was in the carriage, and 
Eliza Millward was the companion of my walk. She had observed my 
preference for the young widow, and evidently felt herself 
neglected. She did not manifest her chagrin by keen reproaches, 
bitter sarcasms, or pouting, sullen silence—any or all of these I 
could easily have endured, or lightly laughed away; but she showed 
it by a kind of gentle melancholy, a mild, reproachful sadness that 
cut me to the heart. I tried to cheer her up, and apparently 
succeeded in some degree, before the walk was over; but in the very 
act my conscience reproved me, knowing, as I did, that sooner or 
later, the tie must be broken, and this was only nourishing false 
hopes, and putting off the evil day. 
</p>
               <p>When the pony-carriage had approached as near Wildfell Hall as the 
road would permit—unless, indeed, it proceeded up the long rough 
lane, which Mrs Graham would not allow—the young widow and her son 
alighted, relinquishing the driver's seat to Rose; and I persuaded 
Eliza to take the latter's place. Having put her comfortably in, bid 
her take care of the evening air, and wished her a kind goodnight, I 
felt considerably relieved, and hastened to offer my services to Mrs 
Graham to carry her apparatus up the fields, but she had already 
hung her camp-stool on her arm and taken her sketchbook in her hand; 
and insisted upon bidding me adieu then and there, with the rest of 
the company. But this time, she declined my proffered aid in so kind 
and friendly a manner, that I almost forgave her.

               <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
               <head>The Present</head>
               <p>Six weeks had passed away. It was a splendid morning about the close 
of June. Most of the hay was cut, but the last week had been very 
unfavourable; and now that fine weather was come at last, being 
determined to make the most of it, I bad gathered all hands together 
into the hayfield, and was working away myself, in the midst of 
them, in my shirt sleeves, with a light, shady straw hat on my head, 
catching up armfuls of moist, reeking grass, and shaking it out to 
the four winds of heaven, at the head of a goodly file of servants 
and hirelings—intending so to labour, from morning to night, with 
as much zeal and assiduity as I could look for from any of them, as 
well to prosper the work by my own exertion as to animate the 
workers by my example—when, lo! my resolutions were overthrown in a 
moment, by the simple fact of my brother's running up to me and 
putting into my hand a small parcel, just arrived from London, which 
I had been for some time expecting. I tore off the cover, and 
disclosed an elegant and portable edition of `Marmion'. 
</p>
               <p>`I guess I know who that's for,' said Fergus, who stood looking on 
while I complacently examined the volume. That's for Miss Eliza, 
now.' 
</p>
               <p>He pronounced this with a tone and look so prodigiously knowing, 
that I was glad to contradict him. 
</p>
               <p>`You're wrong, my lad,' said I; and taking up my coat,, I deposited 
the book in one of its pockets, and then put it on (i.e. the coat). 
`Now come here, you idle dog, and make yourself useful for once,' I 
continued—`Pull off your coat, and take my place in the field till 
I come back.' 
</p>
               <p>Till you come back?—and where are you going, pray?' 
</p>
               <p>`No matter—<hi>where</hi>—the <hi>when</hi> is all that concerns 
you;—and I shall be back by dinner, at least.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh ho! and I'm to labour away till then, am I?—and to keep all 
these fellows hard at it besides?—Well, well! I'll submit—for once 
in a way.—Come, my lads, you must look sharp: I'm coming to help 
you now;—and woe be to that man, or woman either, that pauses for a 
moment amongst you—whether to stare about him, to scratch his head, 
or blow his nose—no pretext will serve—nothing but work, work in 
the sweat of your face,'—etc., etc. 
</p>
               <p>Leaving him thus haranguing the people, more to their amusement than 
edification, I returned to the house, and having made some 
alteration in my toilet, hastened away to Wildfell Hall, with the 
book in my pocket; for it was destined for the shelves of Mrs 
Graham. 
</p>
               <p>`What, then, had she and you got on so well together as to come to 
the giving and receiving of presents?'—Not precisely, old buck; 
this was my first experiment in that line; and I was very anxious to 
see the result of it. 
</p>
               <p>We had met several times since the—Bay excursion, and I had found 
she was not averse to my company, provided I confined my 
conversation to the discussion of abstract matters, or topics of 
common interest;—the moment I touched upon the sentimental or the 
complimentary, or made the slightest approach to tenderness in word 
or look, I was not only punished by an immediate change in her 
manner at the time, but doomed to find her more cold and distant, if 
not entirely inaccessible, when next I sought her company. This 
circumstance did not greatly disconcert me, however, because I 
attributed it, not so much to any dislike of my person, as to some 
absolute resolution against a second marriage formed prior to the 
time of our acquaintance, whether from excess of affection for her 
late husband, or because she had had enough of him and the 
matrimonial state together. At first, indeed, she had seemed to take 
a pleasure in mortifying my vanity and crushing my 
presumption—relentlessly nipping off bud by bud as they ventured to 
appear; and then, I confess, I was deeply wounded, though, at the 
same time, stimulated to seek revenge;—but latterly, finding, 
beyond a doubt, that I was not that empty-headed coxcomb she had 
first supposed me, she had repulsed my modest advances in quite a 
different spirit. It was a kind of serious, almost sorrowful 
displeasure, which I soon learned carefully to avoid awakening. 
</p>
               <p>`Let me first establish my position as a friend,' thought I,—`the 
patron and playfellow of her son, the sober, solid, plain-dealing 
friend of herself, and then, when I have made myself fairly 
necessary to her comfort and enjoyment in life (as I believe I can), 
we'll see what next may be effected.' 
</p>
               <p>So we talked about painting, poetry, and music, theology, geology, 
and philosophy: once or twice I lent her a book, and once she lent 
me one in return: I met her in her walks as often as I could; I came 
to her house as often as I dared. My first pretext for invading the 
sanctum was to bring Arthur a little waddling puppy of which Sancho 
was the father, and which delighted the child beyond expression, 
and, consequently, could not fail to please his mamma. My second was 
to bring him a book, which, knowing his mother's particularity, I 
had carefully selected, and which I submitted for her approbation 
before presenting it to him. Then, I brought her some plants for her 
garden, in my sister's name—having previously persuaded Rose to 
send them. Each of these times I enquired after the picture she was 
painting from the sketch taken on the cliff, and was admitted into 
the studio, and asked my opinion or advice respecting its 
progress. 
</p>
               <p>My last visit had been to return the book she had lent me; and then 
it was, that, in casually discussing the poetry of Sir Walter Scott, 
she had expressed a wish to see `Marmion,' and I had conceived the 
presumptuous idea of making her a present of it, and, on my return 
home, instantly sent for the smart little volume 1 had this morning 
received. But an apology for invading the hermitage was still 
necessary; so I had furnished myself with a blue morocco collar for 
Arthur's little dog; and that being given and received, with much 
more joy and gratitude, on the part of the receiver, than the worth 
of the gift, or the selfish motive of the giver deserved, I ventured 
to ask Mrs Graham for one more look at the picture, if it was still 
there. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh yes! come in,' said she (for I had met them in the garden). `It 
is finished and framed, all ready for sending away; but give me your 
last opinion, and, if you can suggest any further improvement, it 
shall be—duly considered, at least.' 
</p>
               <p>The picture was strikingly beautiful: it was the very scene itself, 
transferred as if by magic to the canvas; but I expressed my 
approbation in guarded terms, and few words, for fear of displeasing 
her. She, however, attentively watched my looks, and her artist's 
pride was gratified, no doubt, to read my heart-felt admiration in 
my eyes. But, while I gazed, I thought upon the book, and wondered 
how it was to be presented. My heart failed me; but I determined not 
to be such a fool as to come away without having made the attempt. 
It was useless waiting for an opportunity, and useless trying to 
concoct a speech for the occasion The more plainly and naturally the 
thing was done, the better, I thought; so I just looked out of the 
window to screw up my courage, and then pulled out the book, turned 
round, and put it into her hand, with this short explanation. 
</p>
               <p>`You were wishing to see `Marmion', Mrs Graham; and here it is, if 
you will be so kind as to take it.' 
</p>
               <p>A momentary flush suffused her face—perhaps a blush of sympathetic 
shame for such an awkward style of presentation: she gravely 
examined the volume on both sides; then silently turned over the 
leaves, knitting her brows the while in serious cogitation; then 
closed the book, and, turning from it to me, quietly asked the price 
of it.—I felt the hot blood rush to my face. 
</p>
               <p>`I'm sorry to offend you, Mr Markham,' said she, `but unless I pay 
for the book, I cannot take it.' And she laid it on the table. 
</p>
               <p>`Why cannot you?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because—`She paused, and looked at the carpet. 
</p>
               <p>`Why cannot you?' I repeated, with a degree of irascibility that 
roused her to lift her eyes, and look me steadily in the face. 
</p>
               <p>`Because I don't like to put myself under obligations that I can 
never repay—I <hi>am</hi> obliged to you, already, for your kindness 
to my son; but his grateful affection, and your own good feelings, 
must reward you for that.' 
</p>
               <p>`Nonsense!' ejaculated I. 
</p>
               <p>She turned her eyes on me again, with a look of quiet, grave 
surprise, that had the effect of a rebuke, whether intended for such 
or not. 
</p>
               <p>`Then you won't take the book?' I asked, more mildly than I had yet 
spoken. 
</p>
               <p>`I will gladly take it, if you will let me pay for it.' 
</p>
               <p>I told her the exact price, and the cost of the carnage besides, in 
as calm a tone as I Could command—for in fact, I was ready to weep 
with disappointment and vexation. 
</p>
               <p>She produced her purse, and coolly counted out the money, but 
hesitated to put it into my hand. Attentively regarding me, in a 
tone of soothing softness she observed,— 
</p>
               <p>`You think yourself insulted, Mr Markham—I wish I could make you 
understand that—that I—`' 
</p>
               <p>`I do understand you, perfectly,' I said. `You think that if you 
were to accept that trifle from me now, I should presume upon it 
hereafter; but you are mistaken:—if you will only oblige me by 
taking it, believe me, I shall build no hopes upon it, and consider 
this no precedent for future favours:—and it is nonsense to talk 
about putting yourself under obligations to <hi>me</hi> when you must 
know that in such a case the obligation is entirely on my side,—the 
favour on yours. 
</p>
               <p>`Well then, I'll take you at your word,' she answered, with a most 
angelic smile, returning the odious money to her purse—`but 
<hi>remember</hi>!' 
</p>
               <p>`I will remember—what I have said;—but do not you punish my 
presumption by withdrawing your friendship entirely from me,—or 
expect me to atone for it by being more distant than before,' said 
I, extending my hand to take leave, for I was too much excited to 
remain. 
</p>
               <p>`Well then! let us be as we were,' replied she, frankly placing her 
hand in mine; and while I held it there, I had much difficulty to 
refrain from pressing it to my lips;—but that would be suicidal 
madness: I had been bold enough already, and this premature offering 
had wellnigh given the death-blow to my hopes. 
</p>
               <p>It was with an agitated, burning heart and brain that I hurried 
homewards, regardless of that scorching noonday sun—forgetful of 
everything but her I had just left—regretting nothing but her 
impenetrability, and my own precipitancy and want of tact—fearing 
nothing but her hateful resolution, and my inability to overcome 
it—hoping nothing—but halt,—I will not bore you with my 
conflIcting hopes and fears—my serious cogitations and resolves.

               <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
               <head>A Snake in the Grass</head>
               <p>THOUGH my affections might now be said to be fairly weaned from 
Eliza Millward, I did not yet entirely relinquish my visits to the 
vicarage, because I wanted, as it were, to let her down easy; 
without raising much sorrow, or incurring much resentment,—or 
making myself the talk of the parish; and besides, if I had wholly 
kept away, the vicar, who looked upon my visits as paid chiefly, if 
not entirely to himself, would have felt himself decidedly affronted 
by the neglect. But when I called there the day after my interview 
with Mrs Graham, he happened to be from home—a circumstance by no 
means so agreeable to me now as it had been on former occasions. 
Miss Millward was there, it is true, but she, of course, would be 
little better than a nonentity. However, I resolved to make my visit 
a short one, and to talk to Eliza in a brotherly, friendly sort of 
way, such as our long acquaintance might warrant me in assuming, and 
which, I thought, could neither give offence nor serve to encourage 
false hopes. 
</p>
               <p>It was never my custom to talk about Mrs Graham either to her or 
anyone else; but I had not been seated three minutes, before she 
brought that lady on to the carpet herself, in a rather remarkable 
manner. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Mr Markham!' said she, with a shocked expression and voice 
subdued almost to a whisper—`what do you think of these shocking 
reports about Mrs Graham?—can you encourage us to disbelieve 
them?' 
</p>
               <p>`What reports?' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah, now! <hi>you</hi> know!' she slyly smiled and shook her head. 
</p>
               <p>`I know nothing about them—What in the world do you mean, 
Eliza?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, don't ask <hi>me</hi>!—I can't explain it.' She took up the 
cambric handkerchief which she had been beautifying with a deep lace 
border, and began to be very busy. 
</p>
               <p>`What is it, Miss Millward? what does she mean?' said I, appealing 
to her sister, who seemed to be absorbed in the hemming of a large, 
coarse sheet. 
</p>
               <p>`I don't know,' replied she.'—`Some idle slander somebody has been 
inventing, I suppose. I never heard it till Eliza told me, the other 
day,—but if all the parish dinned it in my ears, I shouldn't 
believe a word of it—I know Mrs Graham too well!' 
</p>
               <p>`Quite right, Miss Millward!—and so do I—whatever it may be.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well!' observed Eliza, with a gentle sigh—`It's well to have such 
a comfortable assurance regarding the worth of those we love.—I 
only wish you may not find your confidence misplaced.' 
</p>
               <p>And she raised her face, and gave me such a look of sorrowful 
tenderness as might have melted my heart, but within those eyes 
there lurked a something that I did not like; and I wondered how I 
ever could have admired them: her sister's honest face and small 
grey optics appeared far more agreeable;—but I was out of temper 
with Eliza, at that moment, for her insinuations against Mrs 
Graham—which were false, I was certain, whether she knew it or 
not. 
</p>
               <p>I said nothing more on the subject, however, at the time, and but 
little on any other; for, finding I could not well recover my 
equanimity, I presently rose and took leave, excusing my- self under 
the plea of business at the farm;—and to the farm I went—not 
troubling my mind one whit about the possible truth of these 
mysterious reports, but only wondering what they were, by whom 
originated, and on what foundations raised,—and how they could the 
most effectually be silenced or disproved. 
</p>
               <p>A few days after this, we had another of our quiet little parties, 
to which the usual company of friends and neighbours had been 
invited, and Mrs Graham among the number. She could not now absent 
herself under the plea of dark evenings or inclement weather, and, 
greatly to my relief, she came. Without her I should have found the 
whole affair an intolerable bore; but the moment of her arrival 
brought new life to the house; and though I must not neglect the 
other guests for her, or expect to engross much of her attention and 
conversation to myself alone, I anticipated an evening of no common 
enjoyment. 
</p>
               <p>Mr Lawrence came too. He did not arrive till some time after the 
rest were assembled. I was curious to see how he would comport 
himself to Mrs Graham. A slight bow was all that passed between them 
on his entrance; and having politely greeted the other members of 
the company, he seated himself quite aloof from the young widow, 
between my mother and Rose. 
</p>
               <p>`Did you ever see such art!' whispered Eliza, who was my near- est 
neighbour. `Would you not say they were perfect strangers?' 
</p>
               <p>`Almost;—but what then?' 
</p>
               <p>`What then!—why you can't pretend to be ignorant?' 
</p>
               <p>`Ignorant of <hi>what</hi>?' demanded I, so sharply that she started 
and replied.— 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, hush! don't speak so loud.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, tell me then,' I answered, in a lower tone; `what is it you 
mean? I hate enigmas.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, you know, I don't vouch for the truth of it—indeed, far from 
it—but haven't you heard—` 
</p>
               <p>`I've heard <hi>nothing</hi>, except from you.' 
</p>
               <p>`You must be wilfully deaf then; for anyone will tell you that—but 
I shall only anger you by repeating it, I see; so I had better hold 
my tongue.' 
</p>
               <p>She closed her lips and folded her hands before her with an air of 
injured meekness. 
</p>
               <p>`If you had wished not to anger me, you should have held your tongue 
from the beginning; or else spoken out plainly and honestly all you 
had to say.' 
</p>
               <p>She turned aside her face, pulled out her handkerchief, rose, and 
went to the window, where she stood for some time, evidently 
dissolved in tears. I was astounded, provoked, ashamed—not so much 
of my harshness as for her childish weakness. However, no one seemed 
to notice her, and shortly after, we were summoned to the tea-table; 
in those parts it was customary to sit to the table at tea-time, on 
all occasions, and make a meal of it; for we dined early. On taking 
my seat, I had Rose on one side of me, and an empty chair on the 
other. 
</p>
               <p>`May I sit by you?' said a soft voice at my elbow. 
</p>
               <p>`If you like,' was the reply; and Eliza slipped into the vacant 
chair; then looking up in my face with a half sad, half playful 
smile, she whispered— 
</p>
               <p>`You're so stern, Gilbert.' 
</p>
               <p>I handed down her tea with a slightly contemptuous smile, and said 
nothing, for I had nothing to say. 
</p>
               <p>`What have I done to offend you?' said she, more plaintively. `I 
wish I knew.' 
</p>
               <p>`Come, take your tea, Eliza, and don't be foolish,' responded I, 
handing her the sugar and cream. 
</p>
               <p>Just then, there arose a slight commotion on the other side of me, 
occasioned by Miss Wilson's coming to negotiate an exchange of seats 
with Rose. 
</p>
               <p>`Will you be so good as to exchange places with me, Miss Markham?' 
said she, `for I don't like to sit by Mrs Graham. If your mamma 
thinks proper to invite such persons to her house, she cannot object 
to her daughter's keeping company with them.' 
</p>
               <p>This latter clause was added in a sort of soliloquy when Rose was 
gone; but I was not polite enough to let it pass: 
</p>
               <p>`Will you be so good as to tell me what you mean, Miss Wilson?' said 
I. 
</p>
               <p>The question startled her a little, but not much. 
</p>
               <p>`Why Mr Markham,' replied she, coolly, having quickly recovered her 
self-possession, `it surprises me rather that Mrs Markham should 
invite such a person as Mrs Graham to her house; but perhaps she is 
not aware that the lady's character is considered scarcely 
respectable.' 
</p>
               <p>`She is not, nor am I; and therefore, you would oblige me by 
explaining your meaning a little further.' 
</p>
               <p>`This is scarcely the time or the place for such explanations; but I 
think you can hardly be so ignorant as you pretend: you must know 
her as well as I do.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`I think I do, perhaps a little better; and therefore, if you will 
inform me what you have heard, or imagined against her, I shall, 
perhaps, be able to set you right.' 
</p>
               <p>`Can you tell me, then, who was her husband; or if she ever had 
any?' 
</p>
               <p>Indignation kept me silent. At such a time and place I could not 
trust myself to answer. 
</p>
               <p>`Have you never observed,' said Eliza, `what a striking likeness 
there is between that child of hers and—` 
</p>
               <p>`And whom?' demanded Miss Wilson, with an air of cold, but keen 
severity. 
</p>
               <p>Eliza was startled: the timidly spoken suggestion had been intended 
for my ear alone. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I beg your pardon!' pleaded she, `I may be mistaken—perhaps I 
<hi>was</hi> mistaken.' But she accompanied the words with a sly 
glance of derision directed to me from the corner of her 
disingenuous eye. 
</p>
               <p>`There's no need to ask <hi>my</hi> pardon,' replied her friend; `but 
I see no one here that at all resembles that child, except his 
mother; and when you hear ill-natured reports, Miss Eliza, I will 
thank you—that is, I think you will do well to refrain from 
repeating them. I presume the person you allude to is Mr Lawrence; 
but I think I can assure you that your suspicions, in that respect, 
are utterly misplaced; and if he has any particular connection with 
the lady at all (which no one has a right to assert), at least he 
has (what cannot be said of some others) sufficient sense of 
propriety to withhold him from acknowledging anything more than a 
bowing acquaintance in the presence of respectable persons—he was 
evidently both surprised and annoyed to find her here.' 
</p>
               <p>`Go it!' cried Fergus, who sat on the other side of Eliza, and was 
the only individual who shared that side of the table with us; `go 
it like bricks! mind you don't leave her one stone upon another.' 
</p>
               <p>Miss Wilson drew herself up with a look of freezing scorn, but said 
nothing. Eliza would have replied, but I interrupted her by saying, 
as calmly as I could, though in a tone which betrayed, no doubt, 
some little of what I felt within,— 
</p>
               <p>`We have had enough of this subject: if we can only speak to slander 
our betters, let us hold our tongues.' 
</p>
               <p>`I think you'd better,' observed Fergus; `and so does our good 
parson: he has been addressing the company in his richest vein all 
the while, and eyeing you, from time to time, with looks of stern 
distaste, while you sat there, irreverently whispering and muttering 
together; and once he paused in the middle of a story—or a sermon, 
I don't know which, and fixed his eyes upon you, Gilbert, as much as 
to say—“When Mr Markham has done flirting with those two ladies I 
will proceed!”' 
</p>
               <p>What more was said at the tea-table I cannot tell; nor how I found 
patience to sit till the meal was over. I remember, however, that I 
swallowed with difficulty the remainder of the tea that was in my 
cup, and ate nothing; and that the first thing I did was to stare at 
Arthur Graham, who sat beside his mother on the opposite side of the 
table, and the second to stare at Mr Lawrence, who sat below; and, 
first, it struck me that there <hi>was</hi> a likeness; but, on 
further contemplation, I concluded it was only in imagination. Both, 
it is true, had more delicate features and smaller bones than 
commonly fall to the lot of individuals of the rougher sex, and 
Lawrence's complexion was pale and clear, and Arthur's delicately 
fair; but Arthur's tiny, somewhat snubby nose could never become so 
long and straight as Mr Lawrence's, and the outline of his face, 
though not full enough to be round, and too finely converging to the 
small, dimpled chin to be square, could never be drawn out to the 
long oval of the other's; while the child's hair was evidently of a 
lighter, warmer tint than the elder gentleman's had ever been, and 
his large, clear, blue eyes, though prematurely serious at times, 
were utterly dissimilar to the shy, hazel eyes of Mr Lawrence, 
whence the sensitive soul looked so distrustfully forth, as ever 
ready to retire within, from the offences of a too rude, too 
uncongenial world. Wretch that I was to harbour that detestable idea 
for a moment! Did I not know Mrs Graham? Had I not seen her, 
conversed with her time after time? Was I not certain that she, in 
intellect, in purity and elevation of soul, was immeasurably 
superior to any of her detractors; that she was, in fact, the 
noblest, the most adorable, of her sex I had ever beheld, or even 
imagined to exist? Yes, and I would say with Mary Millward (sensible 
girl as she was) that if all the parish, ay, or all the world should 
din these horrible lies in my ears, I would not believe them; for I 
knew her better than they. 
</p>
               <p>Meantime, my brain was on fire with indignation, and my heart seemed 
ready to burst from its prison with conflicting passions. I regarded 
my two fair neighbours with a feeling of abhorrence and loathing I 
scarcely endeavoured to conceal: I was rallied from several quarters 
for my abstraction and ungallant neglect of the ladies; but I cared 
little for that: all I cared about, besides that one grand subject 
of my thoughts, was to see the cups travel up to the tea-tray, and 
not come down again. I thought Mr Millward never <hi>would</hi> cease 
telling us that he was no tea-drinker, and that it was highly 
injurious to keep loading the stomach with slops to the exclusion of 
more wholesome sustenance, and so give himself time to finish his 
fourth cup. 
</p>
               <p>At length it was over; and I rose and left the table and the guests, 
without a word of apology—I could endure their company no longer. I 
rushed out to cool my brain in the balmy evening air, and to compose 
my mind, or indulge my passionate thoughts in the solitude of the 
garden. 
</p>
               <p>To avoid being seen from the windows, I went down a quiet little 
avenue, that skirted one side of the enclosure, at the bottom of 
which was a seat embowered in roses and honeysuckles. Here I sat 
down to think over the virtues and wrongs of the lady of Wildfell 
Hall; but I had not been so occupied two minutes, before voices and 
laughter, and glimpses of moving objects through the trees, informed 
me that the whole company had turned out to take an aIring in the 
garden too, However, I nestled up in a corner of the bower, and 
hoped to retain possession of it, secure alike from observation and 
intrusion. But no—confound it—there was someone coming down the 
avenue! Why couldn't they enjoy the flowers. and sunshine of the 
open garden, and leave that sunless nook to me, and the gnats and 
midges? 
</p>
               <p>But peeping through my fragrant screen of interwoven branches to 
discover who the intruders were (for a murmur of voices told me it 
was more than one), my vexation instantly subsided, and far other 
feelings agitated my still unquiet soul; for there was Mrs Graham, 
slowly moving down the walk with Arthur by her ride, and no one 
else. Why were they alone? Had the poison of detracting tongues 
already spread through all? and had they all turned their backs upon 
her? I now recollected having seen Mrs Wilson, in the early part of 
the evening, edging her chair close up to my mother, and bending 
forward, evidently in the delivery of some important, confidential 
intelligence; and from the incessant wagging of her head, the 
frequent distortions of her wrinkled physiognomy, and the winking 
and malicious twinkle of her little ugly eyes, I judged it was some 
spicy piece of scandal that engaged her powers; and from the 
cautious privacy of the communication, I supposed some person then 
present was the luckless object of her calumnies; and from all these 
tokens, together with my mother's looks and gestures of mingled 
horror and incredulity, I now concluded that object to have been Mrs 
Graham. I did not emerge from my place of concealment, till she had 
nearly reaChed the bottom of the walk, lest my appearance should 
drive her away; and when I did step forward, she stood still and 
seemed inclined to turn back as it was. 
</p>
               <p>Oh, don't let us disturb you, Mr Markham!' said she. `We came here 
to seek retirement ourselves; not to intrude on your seclusion.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am no hermit, Mrs Graham—though I own it looks rather like it, 
to absent myself in this uncourteous fashion from my guests.' 
</p>
               <p>`I feared you were unwell,' said she, with a look of real 
concern. 
</p>
               <p>`I was rather, but it's over now. Do sit here a little, and rest, 
and tell me how you like this arbour,' said I, and lifting Arthur by 
the shoulders, I planted him in the middle of the seat by way of 
securing his mamma, who, acknowledging it to be a tempting place of 
refuge, threw herself back in one corner, while I took possession of 
the other. 
</p>
               <p>But that word refuge disturbed me. Had their unkindness then really 
driven her to seek for peace in solitude? 
</p>
               <p>`Why have they left you alone?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`It is I who have left them,' was the smiling rejoinder. `I was 
wearied to death with small talk—nothing wears me out like that. I 
cannot imagine how they <hi>can</hi> go on as they do.' 
</p>
               <p>I could not help smiling at the serious depth of her wonderment. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it that they think it a duty to be continually talking,' pursued 
she; `and so never pause to think, but fill up with aimless trifles 
and vain repetitions, when subjects of real interest fail to present 
themselves?—or do they really take a pleasure in such 
discourse?' 
</p>
               <p>Very likely they do,' said I: `their shallow minds can hold no great 
ideas, and their light heads are carried away by trivialities that 
would not move a better furnished skill;—and their only alternative 
to such disCourse is to plunge over head and ears into the slough of 
scandal—which is their chief delight.' 
</p>
               <p>`Not all of them surely?' cried the lady, astonished at the 
bitterness of my remark. 
</p>
               <p>`No, certainly; I exonerate my sister from such degraded tastes—and 
my mother too, if you included <hi>her</hi> in your 
animadversions.' 
</p>
               <p>`I meant no animadversions against anyone, and certainly in- tended 
no disrespectful allusions to your mother. I have known some 
sensible persons great adepts in that style of conversation, when 
circumstances impelled them to it; but it is a gift I cannot boast 
the possession of. I kept up my attention, on this occasion, as long 
as I could, but when my powers were exhausted, I stole away, to seek 
a few minutes' repose in this quiet walk. 1 hate talking where there 
is no exchange of ideas or sentiments, and no good given or 
received.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well,' said I, `if ever I trouble you with my loquacity, tell me so 
at once, and I promise not to be offended; for I possess the faculty 
of enjoying the company of those I—of my friends as well in silence 
as in conversation.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't quite believe you; but if it were so, you would exactly 
suit me for a companion.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am all you wish, then, in other respects?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I don't mean that. How beautiful those little clusters of 
foliage look, where the sun comes through behind them!' said she, on 
purpose to change the subject. 
</p>
               <p>And they did look beautiful, where at intervals the level rays of 
the sun, penetrating the thickness of trees and shrubs on the 
opposite side of the path before us, relieved their dusky verdure by 
displaying patches of semitransparent leaves of resplendent golden 
green. 
</p>
               <p>`I almost wish I were not a painter,' observed my companion. 
</p>
               <p>`Why so? one would think at such a time you would most exult in your 
privilege of being able to imitate the various brilliant and 
delightful touches of nature.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; for instead of delivering myself up to the full enjoyment of 
the as others do, I am always troubling my head about how I could 
produce the same effect upon canvas; and as that can never be done, 
it is mere vanity and vexation of spirit.' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps you cannot do it to satisfy yourself, but you may and do 
succeed in delighting others with the result of your endeavours.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, after all I should not complain: perhaps few people gain 
their livelihood with so much pleasure in their toil as I do. Here 
is someone coming.' 
</p>
               <p>She seemed vexed at the interruption. 
</p>
               <p>`It is only Mr Lawrence and Miss Wilson,' said I, `coming to enjoy a 
quiet stroll. They will not disturb us.' 
</p>
               <p>I could not quite decipher the expression of her face; but I was 
satisfied there was no jealousy therein. What business had I to look 
for it? 
</p>
               <p>`What sort of a person is Miss Wilson?' she asked. 
</p>
               <p>`She is elegant and accomplished above the generality of her birth 
and station; and some say she is ladylike and agreeable.' 
</p>
               <p>`I thought her somewhat frigid, and rather supercilious in her 
manner today.' 
</p>
               <p>`Very likely she might be so to you. She has possibly taken a 
prejudice against you, for I think she regards you in the light of a 
rival.' 
</p>
               <p>`Me? Impossible, Mr Markham!' said she, evidently astonished and 
annoyed. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I know nothing about it,' returned I, rather doggedly; for I 
thought her annoyance was chiefly against myself. 
</p>
               <p>The pair had now approached within a few paces of us. Our arbour was 
set snugly back in a corner, before which the avenue, at its 
termination, turned off into the more airy walk along the bottom of 
the garden. As they approached this, I saw, by the aspect of Jane 
Wilson, that she was directing her companion's attention to us; and, 
as well by her cold, sarcastic smile, as by the few isolated words 
of her discourse that reached me, I knew full well that she was 
impressing him with the idea that we were strongly attached to each 
other. I noticed that he coloured up to the temples, gave us one 
furtive glance in passing, and walked on, looking grave, but 
seemingly offering no reply to her remarks. 
</p>
               <p>It was true, then, that he had some designs upon Mrs Graham; and, 
were they honourable, he would not be so anxious to conceal them. 
<hi>She</hi> was blameless, of course, but he was detestable beyond 
all count. 
</p>
               <p>While these thoughts flashed through my mind, my companion abruptly 
rose, and calling her son, said they would now go in quest of the 
company, and departed up the avenue. Doubtless she had heard or 
guessed something of Miss Wilson's remarks, and therefore, it was 
natural enough she should choose to continue the 
tête-à-tête no longer, especially as at that moment 
my cheeks were burning with indignation against my former friend, 
the token of which she might mistake for a blush of stupid 
embarrassment. For this I owed Miss Wilson yet another grudge; and 
still the more I thought upon her conduct, the more I hated her. 
</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening before I joined the company. I found Mrs 
Graham already equipped for departure, and taking leave of the rest, 
who were now returned to the house. I offered—nay, begged to 
accompany her home. Mr Lawrence was standing by at the time, 
conversing with someone else. He did not look at us, but, on hearing 
my earnest request, he paused in the middle of a sentence to listen 
for her reply, and went on, with a look of quiet satisfaction, the 
moment he found it was to be a denial. 
</p>
               <p>A denial it was, decided, though not unkind. She could not be 
persuaded to think there was danger for herself or her child in 
traversing those lonely lanes and fields without attendance. It was 
daylight still, and she should meet no one; or if she did, the 
people were quiet and harmless she was well assured. In fact, she 
would not hear of anyone's putting himself out of the way to 
accompany her, though Fergus vouchsafed to offer his services, in 
case they should be more acceptable than mine, and my mother begged 
she might send one of the farming-men to escort her. 
</p>
               <p>When she was gone, the rest was all a blank, or worse. Lawrence 
attempted to draw me into conversation, but I snubbed him, and went 
to another part of the room. Shortly after, the parry broke up, and 
he himself took leave. When he came to me, I was blind to his 
extended hand, and deaf to his good night till he repeated it a 
second time; and then, to get rid of him, I muttered an inarticulate 
reply accompanied by a sulky nod. 
</p>
               <p>`What is the matter, Markham?' whispered he. 
</p>
               <p>I replied by a wrathful and contemptuous stare. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you angry because Mrs Graham would not let you go home with 
her?' he asked, with a faint smile that nearly exasperated me beyond 
control. 
</p>
               <p>But, swallowing down all fiercer answers, I merely demanded,—`What 
business is it of yours?' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, none,' replied he, with provoking quietness; `only,' and here 
he raised his eyes to my face, and spoke with unusual solemnity, 
`only let me tell you, Markham, that if you have any designs in that 
quarter they will certainly fail; and it grieves me to see you 
cherishing false hopes, and wasting your strength in useless 
efforts, for—` 
</p>
               <p>`Hypocrite!' I exclaimed, and he held his breath, and looked very 
blank, turned white about the gills, and went away without another 
word. 
</p>
               <p>I had wounded him to the quick; and I was glad of it. 
</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X</head>
               <head>A Contract and a Quarrel</head>
               <p>WHEN all were gone, I learned that the vile slander had indeed been 
circulated throughout the company, In the very presence of the 
victim. Rose, however, vowed she did not and would not believe it, 
and my mother made the same declaration, though not, I fear, with 
the same amount of real, unwavering incredulity. It seemed to dwell 
continually on her mind, and she kept irritating me from time to 
time by such expressions as—`Dear, dear, who would have thought 
it!—Well! I always thought there was something odd about her.—You 
see what it is for women to affect to be different to other people.' 
And once it was,— 
</p>
               <p>`I misdoubted that appearance of mystery from the very first—I 
<hi>thought</hi> there would no good come of it; but this is a sad, 
sad, business to be sure!' 
</p>
               <p>`Why mother, you said you didn't believe these tales,' said 
Fergus. 
</p>
               <p>`No more I do, my dear; but then, you know, there must be some 
foundation.' 
</p>
               <p>`The foundation is in the wickedness and falsehood of the world,' 
said I, `and in the fact that Mr Lawrence has been seen to go that 
way once or twice of an evening—and the village gossips say he goes 
to pay his addresses to the strange lady, and the scandalmongers 
have greedily seized the rumour, to make it the basis of their own 
infernal structure.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but Gilbert, there must be something in her manner to 
countenance such reports.' 
</p>
               <p>`Did <hi>you</hi> see anything in her manner?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, certainly; but then, you know, I always said there was 
something strange about her.' 
</p>
               <p>I believe it was on that very evening that I ventured on another 
invasion of Wildfell Hall. From the time of our party, which was 
upwards of a week ago, I had been making daily efforts to meet its 
mistress in her walks; and, always disappointed (she must have 
managed it so on purpose), had nightly kept revolving in my mind 
some pretext for another At length, I concluded that the separation 
could be endured no longer (by this time, you will see I was pretty 
far gone); and, taking from the bookcase an old volume that I 
thought she might be interested in, though, from its unsightly and 
somewhat dilapidated condition, I had not yet ventured to offer it 
for her perusal, I hastened away,—but not without sundry misgivings 
as to how she would receive me, or how I could summon courage to 
present myself with so slight an excuse. But perhaps I might see her 
in the field or the garden, and then there would be no great 
difficulty: it was the formal knocking at the door, with the 
prospect of being gravely ushered in, by Rachel, to the presence of 
a surprised, uncordial mistress, that so greatly disturbed me. 
</p>
               <p>My wish, however, was not gratified. Mrs Graham herself was not to 
be seen; but there was Arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog 
in the garden I looked over the gate and called him to me. He wanted 
me to come in; but I told him I could not without his mother's 
leave. 
</p>
               <p>`I'll go and ask her,' said the child. 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, Arthur, you mustn't do that,—but if she's not engaged, 
just ask her to come here a minute: tell her I want to speak to 
her.' 
</p>
               <p>He ran to perform my bidding, and quickly returned with his mother. 
How lovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light 
summer breeze, her fair cheek slightly flushed, and her countenance 
radiant with smiles!—Arthur! what did I not owe to you for this and 
every other happy meeting?—Through him, I was at once delivered 
from all formality, and terror, and constraint. In love affairs, 
there is no mediator like a merry, simple hearted child—ever ready 
to cement divided hearts, to span the unfriendly gulf of custom, to 
melt the ice of cold reserve, and overthrow the separating walls of 
dread formality and pride. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Mr Markham, what is it?' said the young mother, accosting me 
with a pleasant smile. 
</p>
               <p>`I want you to look at this book, and, if you please, to take it, 
and peruse it at your leisure. I make no apology for calling you out 
on such a lovely evening, though it be for a matter of no greater 
importance.' 
</p>
               <p>`Tell him to come in, mamma,' said Arthur. 
</p>
               <p>`Would you like to come in?' asked the lady. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; I should like to see your improvements in the garden.' 
</p>
               <p>`And how your sister's roots have prospered in my charge,' added 
she, as she opened the gate. 
</p>
               <p>And we sauntered through the garden, and talked of the flowers, the 
trees, and the book,—and then of other things. The evening was kind 
and genial, and so was my companion. By degrees, I waxed more warm 
and tender than, perhaps, I had ever been before; but still I said 
nothing tangible, and she attempted no repulse; until, in passing a 
moss rose-tree that I had brought her some weeks since, in my 
sister's name, she plucked a beautiful half-open bud and bade me 
give it to Rose. 
</p>
               <p>`May I not keep it myself?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`No; but here is another for you' 
</p>
               <p>Instead of taking it quietly, I likewise took the hand that offered 
it, and looked into her face. She let me hold it for a moment, and I 
saw a Bash of ecstatic brilliance in her eye, a glow of glad 
excitement on her face—I thought my hour of victory was come—but 
instantly, a painful recollection seemed to flash upon her; a cloud 
of anguish darkened her brow, a marble paleness blanched her cheek 
and lip; there seemed a moment of inward conflict,—and with a 
sudden effort, she withdrew her hand, and retreated a step or two 
back. 
</p>
               <p>`Now Mr Markham,' said she, with a kind of desperate calmness, I 
must tell you plainly, that I cannot do with this. I like your 
company, because I am alone here, and your conversation pleases me 
more than that of any other person; but if you cannot be content to 
regard me as a friend—a plain, cold, motherly, or sisterly friend, 
I must beg you to leave me now, and let me alone hereafter—in fact, 
we must be strangers for the future.' 
</p>
               <p>`I will, then—be your friend,—or brother, or anything you wish, if 
you will only let me Continue to see you; but tell me why I cannot 
be anything more?' 
</p>
               <p>There was a perplexed and thoughtful pause. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it in consequence of some rash vow?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is something of the kind,' she answered—`some day I may tell 
you, but, at present you had better leave me; and never, Gilbert, 
put me to the painful necessity of repeating what I have just now 
said to you!'—she earnestly added, giving me her hand in serious 
kindness. How sweet, how musical my own name sounded in her 
mouth! 
</p>
               <p>`I will not,' I replied. `But you pardon <hi>this</hi> offence?' 
</p>
               <p>`On condition that you never repeat it.' 
</p>
               <p>`And may I come to see you now and then?' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps,—occasionally; provided you never abuse the privilege.' 
</p>
               <p>`I make no empty promises, but you shall see.' 
</p>
               <p>`The moment you do, our intimacy is at an end, that's all.' 
</p>
               <p>`And will you always call me Gilbert?—it sounds more sisterly, and 
it will serve to remind me of our contract.' 
</p>
               <p>She smiled, and once more bid me go,—and, at length, I judged it 
prudent to obey; and she re-entered the house, and I went down the 
hill. But as I went, the tramp of horses' hoofs fell on my ear, and 
broke the stillness of the dewy evening; and, looking towards the 
lane, I saw a solitary equestrian coming up. Inclining to dusk as it 
was, I knew him at a glance: it was Mr Lawrence on his grey pony. I 
flew across the field—leaped the stone fence—and then walked down 
the lane to meet him. On seeing me, he suddenly drew in his little 
steed, and seemed inclined to turn back, but on second thought, 
apparently judged it better to continue his course as before. He 
accosted me with a slight bow, and, edging close to the wall, 
endeavoured to pass on—but I was not so minded: seizing his horse 
by the bridle, I exclaimed:— 
</p>
               <p>`Now, Lawrence, I will have this mystery explained! Tell me where 
you are going, and what you mean to do—at once, and distinctly!' 
</p>
               <p>`Will you take your hand off the bridle?' said he, quietly—`you're 
hurting my pony's mouth.' 
</p>
               <p>`You and your pony be—' 
</p>
               <p>`What makes you so coarse and brutal, Markham? I'm quite ashamed of 
you.' 
</p>
               <p>`You answer my questions—before you leave this spot! I <hi>will</hi>
know what you mean by this perfidious duplicity?' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall answer <hi>no</hi> questions till you let go the bridle,—if 
you stand till morning.' 
</p>
               <p>`Now then,' said I, unclosing my hand, but still standing before 
him. 
</p>
               <p>`Ask me some other time, when you can speak like a gentleman,' 
returned he, and he made an effort to pass me again; but I quickly 
recaptured the pony, scarce less astonished than its master at such 
uncivil usage. 
</p>
               <p>`Really, Mr Markham, this is too much!' said the latter. `Can I not 
go to see my tenant on matters of business, without being assaulted 
in this manner by—' 
</p>
               <p>`This is no time for business, sir!—I'll tell you, now, what I 
think of your Conduct.' 
</p>
               <p>`You'd better defer your opinion to a more convenient season,' 
interrupted he, in a low tone—`here's the vicar.' 
</p>
               <p>And in truth, the vicar was just behind me, plodding homeward from 
some remote corner of his parish. I immediately released the squire; 
and he went on his way, saluting Mr Millward as he passed. 
</p>
               <p>`What, quarrelling, Markham?' cried the latter, addressing himself 
to me,—`and about that young widow I doubt,' he added, 
reproachfully shaking his head. `But let me tell you, young man 
(here he put his face into mine with an important, confidential 
air), `the's not worth it!' and he confirmed the assertion by a 
solemn nod. 
</p>
               <p>`Mr MILLWARD!' I exclaimed, in a tone of wrathful menace that made 
the reverend gentleman look round—aghast—astounded at such 
unwonted insolence, and stare me in the face, with a look that 
plainly said: `What, this to me!' But I was too indignant to 
apologize, or to speak another word to him: I turned away, and 
hastened homewards, descending with rapid strides the steep, rough 
lane, and leaving him to follow as he pleased.

               <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
               <head>The Vicar Again</head>
               <p>You must suppose about three weeks passed over. Mrs Graham and I 
were now established friends—or brother and sister, as we rather 
chose to consider ourselves. She called me Gilbert, by my express 
desire, and I called her Helen, for I had seen that name written in 
her books. I seldom attempted to see her above twice a week; and 
still I made our meetings appear the result of accident as often as 
I could—for I found it necessary to be extremely careful—and, 
altogether, I behaved with such exceeding propriety that she never 
had occasion to reprove me once. Yet I could not but perceive that 
she was at times unhappy and dissatisfied with herself—or her 
position, and truly I myself was not quite contented with the 
latter: this assumption of brotherly nonchalance was very hard to 
sustain, and I often felt myself a most confounded hypocrite with it 
all; I saw too, or rather I felt, that, in spite of herself, `I was 
not indifferent to her,” as the novel heroes modestly express it, 
and while I thankfully enjoyed my present good fortune, I could not 
fail to wish and hope for something better in future; but of course, 
I kept such dreams entirely to myself. 
</p>
               <p>`Where are you going, Gilbert?' said Rose, one evening, shortly 
after tea, when I had been busy with the farm all day, 
</p>
               <p>`To take a walk,' was the reply. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you always brush your hat so carefully, and do your hair so 
nicely, and put on such smart new gloves when you take a walk?' 
</p>
               <p>`Not always.' 
</p>
               <p>`You're going to Wildfell Hall, aren't you?' 
</p>
               <p>`What makes you think so?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because you look as if you were—but I wish you wouldn't go so 
often.' 
</p>
               <p>`Nonsense, child! I don't go once in six weeks—what do you 
mean?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but if I were you, I wouldn't have so much to do with Mrs 
Graham.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why Rose, are you, too, giving in to the prevailing opinion?' 
</p>
               <p>`No,' returned she, hesitatingly—`but I've heard so much about her 
lately, both at the Wilsons' and the vicarage;—and besides, mamma 
says, if she were a proper person, she would not be living there by 
herself—and don't you remember last winter, Gilbert, all that about 
the false name to the picture; and how she explained it—saying she 
had friends or acquaintances from whom she wished her present 
residence to be concealed, and that she was afraid of their tracing 
her out;—and then, how suddenly she started up and left the room 
when that person came—whom she took good care not to let us catch a 
glimpse of, and who Arthur, with such an air of mystery, told us was 
his mamma's friend?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, Rose, I remember it all; and I can forgive your uncharitable 
conclusions; for perhaps, if I did not know her myself, I should put 
all these things together, and believe the same as you do; but thank 
God, I do know her; and I should be unworthy the name of a man, if I 
could believe anything that was said against her, unless I heard it 
from her own lips.—I should as soon believe such things of you, 
Rose.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Gilbert!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, do you think I <hi>could</hi> believe anything of the 
kind,—whatever the Wilsons and Millwards dared to whisper?' 
</p>
               <p>`I should hope <hi>not</hi> indeed!' 
</p>
               <p>`And why not?—Because I know you—well, and I know her just as 
well.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no! you know nothing of her former life; and last year at this 
time, you did not know that such a person existed.' 
</p>
               <p>`No matter. There is' such a thing as looking through a person's 
eyes into the heart, and learning more of the height, and breadth, 
and depth of another's soul in one hour, than it might take you a 
lifetime to discover, if he or she were not disposed to reveal 
it,—or if you had not the sense to understand it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you <hi>are</hi> going to see her this evening?' 
</p>
               <p>To be sure I am!' 
</p>
               <p>`But what would mamma say, Gilbert?' 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma needn't know.' 
</p>
               <p>`But she must know sometime,if you go on' 
</p>
               <p>`Go on!—there's no going on in the matter—Mrs Graham and I are two 
friends—and will be; and no man breathing shall hinder it,—or has 
a right to interfere between us.' 
</p>
               <p>`But if you knew how they talk, you would be more careful—for her 
sake as well as for your own. Jane Wilson thinks your visits to the 
old hall but another proof of her depravity—' 
</p>
               <p>`Confound Jane Wilson!' 
</p>
               <p>`And Eliza Millward is quite grieved about you.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope she is.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I wouldn't if I were you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Wouldn't what?—How do they know that I go there?' 
</p>
               <p>`There's nothing hid from them: they spy out everything.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I never thought of this!—And so they dare to turn my 
friendship into food for further scandal against her!—That proves 
the falsehood of their other lies, at all events, if any proof were 
wanting.—Mind you contradict them, Rose, whenever you can.' 
</p>
               <p>`But they don't speak openly to me about such things: it is only by 
hints and innuendoes, and by what I hear others say, that I know 
what they think.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well then, I won't go today, as it's getting latish. But oh, deuce 
take their cursed envenomed tongues!' I muttered, in the bitterness 
of my soul. 
</p>
               <p>And just at that moment, the vicar entered the room: we had been too 
much absorbed in our conversation to observe his knock. Alter his 
customary cheerful and fatherly greeting of Rose, who was rather a 
favourite with the old gentleman, he turned somewhat sternly to 
me:— 
</p>
               <p>`Well, sir!' said he, `you're quite a stranger. It is-let-me-see,' 
he continued, slowly, as he deposited his ponderous bulk in the 
armchair that Rose officiously brought towards him, `it is just 
six—weeks—by my reckoning, since you darkened—my—door!' He spoke 
it with emphasis, and struck his stick on the floor. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it, sir?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`Ay! It is so!' He added an affiramatory nod, and continued to gaze 
upon me with a kind of irate solemnity, holding his substantial 
stick between his knees, with his hands clasped upon its head. 
</p>
               <p>`I have been busy,' I said, for an apology was evidently 
demanded. 
</p>
               <p>`Busy!' repeated he, derisively. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; you know I've been getting in my hay: and now the harvest is 
beginning.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humph!' 
</p>
               <p>Just then my mother came in, and created a diversion in my favour by 
her loquacious and animated welcome of the reverend guest. She 
regretted deeply that he had not come a little earlier, in time for 
tea, but offered to have some immediately prepared, if he would do 
her the favour to partake of it. 
</p>
               <p>`Not any for me, I thank you,' replied he; `I shall be at home in a 
few minutes.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, but do stay and take a little! it will be ready in five 
minutes.' 
</p>
               <p>But he rejected the offer with a majestic wave of the hand. 
</p>
               <p>`I'll tell you what I'll take, Mrs Markham,' said he: `I'll take a 
glass of your excellent ale.' 
</p>
               <p>`With pleasure!' cried my mother, proceeding with alacrity to 
pull.the bell and order the favoured beverage. 
</p>
               <p>`I thought,' continued he, `I'd just look in upon you as I passed, 
and taste your home-brewed ale. I've been to call on Mrs Graham.' 
</p>
               <p>`Have you indeed?' 
</p>
               <p>He nodded gravely, and added with awful emphasis— 
</p>
               <p>I thought it incumbent upon me to do so.' 
</p>
               <p>`Really!' ejaculated my mother. 
</p>
               <p>`Why so, Mr Millward?' asked I. He looked at me with some severity, 
and turning again to my mother, repeated— 
</p>
               <p>`I thought it incumbent upon me!' and struck his stick on the floor 
again. My mother sat opposite, an awe-struck but admiring 
auditor. 
</p>
               <p>`”Mrs Graham,” said I,' he continued, shaking his head as he spoke, 
`”these are terrible reports!” “What sir?” says she, affecting to be 
ignorant of my meaning. “It is my—duty—as—your pastor,” said I, 
“to tell you both everything that I myself see reprehensible in your 
conduct, and all I have reason to suspect, and what others tell me 
concerning you”—So I told her!' 
</p>
               <p>`You did sir?' cried I, starting from my seat, and striking my fist 
on the table. He merely glanced towards me, and 
continued—addressing his hostess: 
</p>
               <p>`It was a painful duty, Mrs Markham—but I told her!' 
</p>
               <p>`And how did she take it?' asked my mother. 
</p>
               <p>`Hardened, I fear—hardened!' he replied, with a despondent shake of 
the head; `and at the same time, there was a strong display of 
unchastened, misdirected passions. She turned white in the face, and 
drew her breath through her teeth in a savage sort of way;—but she 
offered no extenuation or defence; and with a kind of shameless 
calmness—shocking indeed to witness, in one so young—as good as 
told me that my remonstrance was unavailing, and my pastoral advice 
quite thrown away upon her—nay, that my very <hi>presence</hi> was 
displeasing while I spoke such things. And I withdrew at length, too 
plainly seeing that nothing could be done—and sadly grieved to find 
her case so hopeless. But I am fully determined, Mrs Markham, that 
my daughters—shall—not—consort with her. Do you adopt the same 
resolution with regard to yours!—As for your sons—as for you, 
young man,' he continued, sternly turning to me. 
</p>
               <p>`As for ME, sir,—' I began, but checked by some impediment in my 
utterance, and finding that my whole frame trembled with fury, I 
said no more—but took the wiser part of snatching up my hat and 
bolting from the room, slamming the door behind me with a bang that 
shook the house to its foundations and made my mother scream—and 
gave a momentary relief to my excited feelings. 
</p>
               <p>The next minute saw me hurrying with rapid strides in the direction 
of Wildfell Hall—to what intent or purpose I could scarcely tel!, 
but I must be moving somewhere, and no other goal would do—I must 
see her, too, and speak to her—that was certain, but what to say or 
how to act, I had no definite idea. Such stormy thoughts—so many 
different resolutions—crowded in upon me, hat my mind was little 
better than a chaos of conflicting passions. 
</p>

            <div xml:id="c1.12" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
               <head>A Tête-à-Tête and a Discovery</head>
               <p>In little more than twenty minutes, the journey was accomplished. I 
paused at the gate to wipe my streaming forehead, and recover my 
breath and some degree of composure. Already the rapid walking had 
somewhat mitigated my excitement; and with a firm and steady tread, 
I paced the garden walk. In passing the inhabited wing of the 
building, I caught a sight of Mrs Graham through the open window, 
slowly pacing up and down her lonely room. 
</p>
               <p>She seemed agitated, and even dismayed, at my arrival, as if she 
thought I too was coming to accuse her. I had entered her presence 
intending to condole with her upon the wickedness of the world, and 
help her to abuse the vicar and his vile informants, but now I felt 
positively ashamed to mention the subject, and determined not to 
refer to it, unless she led the way. 
</p>
               <p>`I am come at an unseasonable hour,' said I, assuming a cheerfulness 
I did not feel, in order to reassure her; `but I won't stay many 
minutes.' 
</p>
               <p>She smiled upon me, faintly it is true, but most kindly—I had 
almost said thankfully, as her apprehensions were removed. 
</p>
               <p>`How dismal you are, Helen! Why have you no fire?' I said, looking 
round on the gloomy apartment. 
</p>
               <p>`It is summer yet,' she replied. 
</p>
               <p>`But <hi>we always</hi> have a fire in the evenings—if we can bear 
it;—and you, especially, require one in this cold house and dreary 
room. 
</p>
               <p>`You should have come a little sooner, and I would have had one 
lighted for you; but it is not worth while now—you won't stay many 
minutes, you say, and Arthur is gone to bed.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I have a fancy for a fire, nevertheless. Will you order one, if 
I ring?' 
</p>
               <p>`Why Gilbert, you don't <hi>look</hi> cold!' said she, smilingly 
regarding my face, which no doubt seemed warm enough. 
</p>
               <p>`No,' replied I, `but I want to see you comfortable before I go.' 
</p>
               <p>`Me comfortable!' repeated she, with a bitter laugh, as if there 
were something amusingly absurd in the idea. `It suits me better as 
it is,' she added, in a tone of mournful resignation. 
</p>
               <p>But determined to have my own way, I pulled the bell. 
</p>
               <p>`There now, Helen!' I said, as the approaching steps of Rachel were 
heard in answer to the summons. There was nothing for it but to turn 
round and desire the maid to light the fire. 
</p>
               <p>I owe Rachel a grudge to this day for the look she cast upon me ere 
she departed on her mission—the sour, suspicious, inquisitorial 
look that plainly demanded, `What are <hi>you</hi> here for, I 
wonder?' Her mistress did not fail to notice it, and a shade of 
uneasiness darkened her brow. 
</p>
               <p>`You must not stay long, Gilbert,' said she, when the door was 
closed upon us. 
</p>
               <p>`I'm not going to,' said I, somewhat testily, though without a grain 
of anger in my heart against anyone but the meddling old woman. `But 
Helen, I've something to say to you before I go.' 
</p>
               <p>`What is it?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, not now—I don't know yet precisely what it is—or how to say 
it,' replied I, with more truth than wisdom; and then, fearing lest 
she should turn me out of the house, I began talking about 
indifferent matters in order to gain time. Meanwhile Rachel came in 
to kindle the fire, which was soon effected by thrusting a red-hot 
poker between the bars of the grate, where the fuel was already 
disposed for ignition. She honoured me with another of her hard, 
inhospitable looks in departing, but, little moved thereby, I went 
on talking; and setting a chair for Mrs Graham on one side of the 
hearth and one for myself on the other, I ventured to sit down, 
though half suspecting she would rather see me go. 
</p>
               <p>In a little while we both relapsed into silence, and continued for 
several minutes gazing abstractedly into the fire—she intent upon 
her own sad thoughts, and I reflecting how delightful it would be to 
be seated thus beside her with no other presence to restrain our 
intercourse—not even that of Arthur, our mutual friend, without 
whom we had never met before—if only I could venture to speak my 
mind, and disburden my full heart of the feelings that had so long 
oppressed it, and witch it now struggled to retain, with an effort 
that it seemed impossible to continue much longer,—and revolving 
the pros and cons for opening my heart to her there and then, and 
imploring a return of affection, the permission to regard her 
thenceforth as my own, and the right and the power to defend her 
from the calumnies of malicious tongues. On the one hand, I felt a 
new-born confidence in my powers of persuasion—a strong conviction 
that my own fervour of spirit would grant me eloquence—that my very 
determination—the absolute necessity for succeeding that I 
felt—must win me what I sought; while on the other, I feared to 
lose the ground I had already gained with so much toil and skill, 
and destroy all future hope by one rash effort, when time and 
patience might have won success. It was like setting my life upon 
the cast of a die; and yet I was ready to resolve upon the attempt. 
At any rate I would entreat the explanation she had half promised to 
give me before: I would demand the reason of this hateful barrier, 
this mysterious impediment to my happiness and, as I trusted, to her 
own. 
</p>
               <p>But while I considered in what manner I could best frame my request, 
my companion wakened from her reverie with a scarcely audible sigh, 
and looking towards the window where the blood-red harvest moon, 
just rising over one of the grim, fantastic ever-greens, was shining 
in upon us, said,— 
</p>
               <p>`Gilbert, it is getting late.' 
</p>
               <p>`I see,' said I. `You want me to go,I suppose.' 
</p>
               <p>`I think you ought. If my kind neighbours get to know of this 
visit—as no doubt they will—they will not turn it much to my 
advantage' 
</p>
               <p>It was with what the vicar would doubtless have called a savage sort 
of a smile that she said this. 
</p>
               <p>`Let them turn it as they will,' said I. `What are their thoughts to 
you or me, so long as we are satisfied with ourselves—and each 
other. Let them go to the deuce with their vile constructions and 
their lying inventions!' 
</p>
               <p>This outburst brought a flush of colour to her face. 
</p>
               <p>`You have heard, then, what they say of me?' 
</p>
               <p>`I heard some detestable falsehoods; but none but fools would credit 
them for a moment, Helen, so don't let them trouble you.' 
</p>
               <p>`I did not think Mr Millward a fool, and he believes it all; but 
however little you may value the opinions of those about 
you—however little you may esteem them as individuals, it is not 
pleasant to be looked upon as a liar and a hypocrite, to be thought 
to practice what you abhor, and to encourage the vices you would 
discountenance, to find your good intentions frustrated, and your 
hands crippled by your supposed unworthiness, and to bring disgrace 
on the principles you profess.' 
</p>
               <p>`True; and if I, by my thoughtlessness and selfish disregard to 
appearances, have at all assisted to expose you to these evils, let 
me entreat you not only to pardon me, but to enable me to make 
reparation; authorize me to clear your name from every imputation: 
give me the right to identify your honour with my own, and to defend 
your reputation as more precious than my life!' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you hero enough to unite yourself to one whom you know to be 
suspected and despised by all around you, and identify your 
interests and your honour with hers? Think! it is a serious 
thing.' 
</p>
               <p>`I should be proud to do it, Helen!—most happy—delighted beyond 
expression!—and if that be all the obstacle to our union, it is 
demolished, and you must—you shall be mine!' 
</p>
               <p>And starting from my seat in a frenzy of ardour, I seized her hand 
and would have pressed it to my lips, but she as suddenly caught it 
away, exclaiming in the bitterness of intense affliction:— 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, it is not all!' 
</p>
               <p>`What is it then? You promised I should know sometime, and— 
</p>
               <p>`You shall know sometime—but not now—my head aches terribly,' she 
said, pressing her hand to her forehead, `and I must have some 
repose—and surely, I have had misery enough to day!' she added, 
almost wildly. 
</p>
               <p>`But it could not harm you to tell it,' I persisted: `it would ease 
your mind; and I should then know how to comfort you.' 
</p>
               <p>She shook her head despondingly. `If you knew all, you, too, would 
blame me—perhaps even more than I deserve—though I have cruelly 
wronged you,' she added in a low murmur, as if she mused aloud. 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>You</hi>, Helen? Impossible!' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, not willingly; for I did not know the strength and depth of 
your attachment—I thought—at least I endeavoured to think your 
regard for me was as cold and fraternal as you professed it to 
be.' 
</p>
               <p>`Or as yours?' 
</p>
               <p>`Or as mine—ought to have been—of such a light and selfish, 
superficial nature that—`' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>There</hi>, indeed, you wronged me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I know I did; and sometimes, I suspected it then; but I thought, 
upon the whole, there could be no great harm in leaving your fancies 
and your hopes to dream themselves to nothing—or flutter away to 
some more fitting object, while your friendly sympathies remained 
with me; but if I had known the depth of your regard, the generous 
disinterested affection you seem to feel—`' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>Seem</hi>, Helen?' 
</p>
               <p>`That you do feel, then, I would have acted differently.' 
</p>
               <p>`How? You <hi>could</hi> not have given me less encouragement, or 
treated me with greater severity than you did! And if you think you 
have wronged me by giving me your friendship, and occasionally 
admitting me to the enjoyment of your company and conversation, when 
all hopes of closer intimacy were vain—as indeed you always gave me 
to understand—if you think you have wronged me by this, you are 
mistaken; for such favours, in themselves alone, are not only 
delightful to my heart, but purifying, exalting, ennobling to my 
soul; and I would rather have your friendship than the love of any 
other woman in the world!' 
</p>
               <p>Little comforted by this, she clasped her hands upon her knee, and 
glancing upward, seemed, in silent anguish, to implore divine 
assistance; then turning to me, she calmly said— 
</p>
               <p>`To-morrow, if you meet me on the moor about midday, I will tell you 
all you seek to know; and perhaps you will then see the necessity of 
discontinuing our intimacy—if, indeed, you do not willingly resign 
me as one no longer worthy of regard.' 
</p>
               <p>`I can safely answer no, to that: you cannot have such grave 
confessions to make—you must be trying my faith, Helen.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, no,' she earnestly repeated—`I wish it were so! Thank 
Heaven,' she added, `I have no great crime to confess; but I have 
more than you will like to hear, or, perhaps, can readily 
excuse,—and more than I can tell you now; so let me entreat you,to 
leave me!' 
</p>
               <p>`I will; but answer me this one question first;—do you love me?' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`I will not answer it' 
</p>
               <p>`Then I will conclude you do; and so good night.' 
</p>
               <p>She turned from me to hide the emotion she could not quite control; 
but I took her hand and fervently kissed it. 
</p>
               <p>`Gilbert, <hi>do</hi> leave me!' she cried, in a tone of such 
thrilling anguish that I felt it would be cruel to disobey. But I 
gave one look back before I closed the door, and saw her leaning 
forward on the table, with her hands pressed against her eyes, 
sobbing convulsively; yet I withdrew in silence. I felt that to 
obtrude my consolations on her then would only serve to aggravate 
her sufferings. 
</p>
               <p>To tell you all the questionings and conjectures—the fears, and 
hopes, and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through 
my mind as I descended the hill, would almost fill a volume in 
itself. But before I was half-way down a sentiment of strong 
sympathy for her I had left behind me had displaced all other 
feelings, and seemed imperatively to draw me back: I began to think, 
`Why am I hurrying so fast in this direction? Can I find comfort or 
consolation—peace, certainty, contentment, all—or anything that I 
want at home? and can I leave all perturbation, sorrow and anxiety 
behind me there?' 
</p>
               <p>And I turned round to look at the old hall. There was little besides 
the chimneys visible above my contracted horizon. I walked back to 
get a better view of it. When it rose in sight, I stood still a 
moment to look, and then continued moving towards the gloomy object 
of attraction. Something called me nearer—nearer still—and why 
not, pray? Might I not find more benefit in the contemplation of 
that venerable pile with the full moon in the cloudless heaven 
shining so calmly above it—with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to 
an August night—and the mistress of my soul within, than in 
returning to my home where all comparatively was light, and life, 
and cheerfulness, and therefore inimical to me in my present frame 
of mind,—and the more so that its inmates all were more or less 
imbued with that detestable belief the very <hi>thought</hi> of which 
made my blood boil in my veins—and how could I endure to hear it 
openly declared—or cautiously insinuated—which was worse?—I had 
had trouble enough already, with some babbling fiend that would keep 
whispering in my ear, `It may be true,' till I had shouted aloud, 
`It is false! I defy you to make me suppose it!' 
</p>
               <p>I could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour 
window. I went up to the garden wall, and stood leaning over it, 
with my eyes fixed upon the lattice, wondering what she was doing, 
thinking, or suffering now, and wishing I could speak to her but one 
word, or even catch one glimpse of her, before I went. 
</p>
               <p>I had not thus looked, and wished, and wondered long, before I 
vaulted over the barrier, unable to resist the temptation of taking 
one glance through the window, just to see if she were more composed 
than when we parted;—and if I found her still in deep distress, 
perhaps I might venture to attempt a word of comfort—to utter one 
of the many things I should have said before, instead of aggravating 
her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity. I looked. Her chair was 
vacant: so was the room. But at that moment someone opened the outer 
door, and a voice—<hi>her</hi> voice—said,— 
</p>
               <p>`Come out—I want to see the moon, and breathe the evening air: they 
will do me good—if anything will.' 
</p>
               <p>Here, then, were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden. 
I wished myself safe back over the wall. I stood, however, in the 
shadow of the tall holly bush, which, standing between the window 
and the porch, at present screened me from observation, but did not 
prevent me from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight; 
Mrs Graham followed by another—<hi>not</hi> Rachel, but a young man, 
slender and rather tall. Oh heavens, how my temples throbbed! 
Intense anxiety darkened my sight; but I thought—yes, and the voice 
confirmed it—it was Mr Lawrence. 
</p>
               <p>`You should not let it worry you so much, Helen,' said he; `I will 
be more cautious in future; and in time—`' 
</p>
               <p>I did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside 
her and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words. My heart 
was splitting with hatred; but I listened intently for her reply. I 
heard it plainly enough. 
</p>
               <p>`But I must leave this place, Frederick,' she said—`I never can be 
happy here,—nor anywhere else, indeed,' she added, with mirthless 
laugh,—`but I cannot rest here.' 
</p>
               <p>`But where could you find a better place?' replied he,—`so 
secluded—so near me, if you think anything of that.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes,' interrupted she, `it is all I could wish, if they could only 
have left me alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`But wherever you go, Helen, there will be the same sources of 
annoyance. I cannot consent to lose you: I must go with you, or come 
to you; and there are meddling fools elsewhere, as will as here.' 
</p>
               <p>While thus conversing, they had sauntered slowly past me down the 
walk, and I heard no more of their discourse; but I saw him put his 
arm round her waist, while she lovingly rested her hand on his 
shoulder;—and then, a tremulous darkness obscured my sight, my 
heart sickened and my head burned like fire, I half rushed, half 
staggered from the spot where horror had kept me rooted, and leaped 
or tumbled over the wall—I hardly know which—but I know that, 
afterwards, like a passionate child, I dashed myself on the ground 
and lay there in a paroxysm of anger and despair—how long, I cannot 
undertake to say; but it must have been a considerable time; for 
when, having partially relieved myself by a torrent of tears, and 
looked up at the moon, shining so calmly and carelessly on, as 
little influenced by my misery as I was by its peaceful radiance, 
and earnestly prayed for death or forgetfulness, I had risen and 
journeyed homewards—little regarding the way, but carried 
instinctively by my feet to the door, I found it bolted against me, 
and everyone in bed except my mother, who hastened to answer my 
impatient knocking, and received me with a shower of questions and 
rebukes:— 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Gilbert, how <hi>could</hi> you do so? Where <hi>have</hi> you 
been? Do come in and take your supper—I've got it all ready, though 
you don't deserve it for keeping me in such a fright after the 
strange manner you left the house this evening. Mr Millward was 
quite—Bless the boy! how ill he looks! Oh, gracious! what is the 
matter?' 
</p>
               <p>`Nothing, nothing—give me a candle.' 
</p>
               <p>`But won't you take some supper?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I want to go to bed,' said I, taking a candle and lighting it 
at the one she held in her hand. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Gilbert, how you tremble!' exclaimed my anxious parent. 
</p>
               <p>`How white you look!—Do tell me what it is? Has anything 
happened?' 
</p>
               <p>`It's nothing!' cried I, ready to stamp with vexation because the 
candle would not light. Then, suppressing my irritation, I added, 
`I've been walking too fast, that's all. Good night,' and marched 
off to bed, regardless of the `Walking too fast! where have you 
been?' that was called after me from below. 
</p>
               <p>My mother followed me to the very door of my room with her 
questionings and advice concerning my health and my conduct; but I 
implored her to let me alone till morning; and she withdrew, and at 
length, I had the satisfaction to hear her close her own door. There 
was no sleep for me, however, that night, as I thought; and instead 
of attempting to solicit it, I employed myself in rapidly pacing the 
chamber—having first removed my boots lest my mother should hear 
me. But the boards creaked, and she was watchful. I had not walked 
above a quarter of an hour before she was at the door again. 
</p>
               <p>`Gilbert, why are you not in bed—you said you wanted to go?' 
</p>
               <p>`Confound it! I'm going,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`But why are you so long about it? you must have something on your 
mind—`' 
</p>
               <p>`For Heaven's sake, let me alone, and get to bed yourself!' 
</p>
               <p>`Can it be that Mrs Graham that distresses you so?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, I tell you—It's nothing!' 
</p>
               <p>`I wish to goodness it mayn't!' murmured she, with a sigh, as she 
returned to her own apartment, while I threw myself on the bed, 
feeling most undutifully disaffected towards her for having deprived 
me of what seemed the only shadow of a consolation that remained, 
and chained me to that wretched couch of thorns. 
</p>
               <p>Never did I endure so long, so miserable a night as that. And yet it 
was not wholly sleepless: towards morning my distracting thoughts 
began to lose all pretensions to coherency, and shape themselves 
into confused and feverish dreams, and, at length, there followed an 
interval of unconscious slumber. But then the dawn of bitter 
recollection that succeeded—the waking to find life a blank, and 
worse than a blank—teeming with torment and misery—not a mere 
barren wilderness, but full of thorns and briars—to find myself 
deceived, duped, hopeless, affections trampled upon, my angel not an 
angel, and my friend a fiend incarnate—it was worse than if I had 
not slept at all. 
</p>
               <p>It was a dull, gloomy morning, the weather had changed like my 
prospects, and the rain was pattering against the window. I rose, 
nevertheless, and went out; not to look after the farm, though that 
would serve as my excuse, but to cool my brain, and regain, if 
possible, a sufficient degree of composure to meet the family at the 
morning meal without exciting inconvenient remarks. If I got a 
wetting, that, in conjunction with a pretended over-exertion before 
breakfast, might excuse my sudden loss of appetite; and if a cold 
ensued, the severer the better, it would help to account for the 
sullen moods and moping melancholy likely to cloud my brow for long 
enough.

               <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
               <head>Return to Duty</head>
               <p>“My dear Gilbert! I wish you <hi>would</hi> try to be a little more 
amiable,” said my mother, one morning after some display of 
unjustifiable ill humour on my part. “You say there is nothing the 
matter with you, and nothing has happened to grieve you, and yet I 
never <hi>saw</hi> anyone so altered as you within these last few 
days: you haven't a good word for anybody—friends and strangers, 
equals and inferiors—it's all the same. I do wish you'd try to 
check it.” 
</p>
               <p>“Check what?” 
</p>
               <p>“Why, your strange temper. You don't know how it spoils you. I'm 
sure a finer disposition than yours, by nature, could not be, if 
you'd let it have fair play; so you've no excuse <hi>that</hi>
way.” 
</p>
               <p>While she thus remonstrated, I took up a book, and laying it open on 
the table before me, pretended to be deeply absorbed in its perusal; 
for I was equally unable to justify myself, and unwilling to 
acknowledge my errors; and I wished to have nothing to say on the 
matter. But my excellent parent went on lecturing, and then came to 
coaxing, and began to stroke my hair; and I was getting to feel 
quite a good boy, but my mischievous brother, who was idling about 
the room, revived my corruption by suddenly calling out:— 
</p>
               <p>“Don't touch him, mother! he'll bite! He's a very tiger in human 
form. <hi>I've</hi> given him up, for my part—fairly disowned 
him—cast him off, root and branch. It's as much as my life is worth 
to come within six yards of him. The other day he nearly fractured 
my skull for singing a pretty, inoffensive love song, on purpose to 
amuse him.” 
</p>
               <p>“Oh, Gilbert! how could you?” exclaimed my mother. 
</p>
               <p>“I told you to hold your noise first, you know, Fergus,” said I. 
</p>
               <p>“Yes, but when I assured you it was no trouble, and went on with 
tile next verse, thinking you might like it better, you clutched me 
by the shoulder and dashed me away, right against the wall there, 
with such force, that I thought I had bitten my tongue in two, and 
expected to see the place plastered with my brains; and when I put 
my hand to my head and found my skull not broken, I thought it was a 
miracle and no mistake. But poor fellow!” added he, with a 
sentimental sigh—“his heart's broken—that's the truth of it—and 
his head's—” 
</p>
               <p>“Will you be silent NOW?” cried I, starting up, and eyeing the 
fellow so fiercely that my mother, thinking I meant to inflict some 
grievous bodily injury, laid her hand on my arm, and besought me to 
let him alone, and he walked leisurely out, with his hands in his 
pockets, singing provokingly—“Shall I because a woman's fair,” 
etc. 
</p>
               <p>“I'm not going to defile my fingers with him,” said I, in answer to 
the maternal intercession. “I wouldn't touch him with the tongs.” 
</p>
               <p>I now recollected that I had business with Robert Wilson, concerning 
the purchase of a certain field adjoining my farm—a business I had 
been putting off from day to day; for I had no interest in anything 
now; and besides, I Was misanthropically inclined, and, moreover, 
had a particular objection to meeting Jane Wilson or her mother; for 
though I had too good reason, now, to credit their reports 
concerning Mrs Graham, I did not like <hi>them</hi> a bit the better 
for it—or Eliza Millward either—and the thought of meeting them 
was the more repugnant to me, that I could not, now, defy their 
seeming calumnies and triumph in my own convictions as before. But 
to-day, I determined to make an effort to return to my duty. Though 
I found no pleasure in it, it would be less irksome than 
idleness—at all events it would be more profitable. If life 
promised no enjoyment within my vocation, at least it offered no 
allurements out of it; and henceforth, I would put my shoulder to 
the wheel and toil away, like any poor drudge of a cart-horse that 
was fairly broken in to its labour, and plod through life, not 
wholly useless if not agreeable, and uncomplaining if not contented 
with my lot. 
</p>
               <p>Thus resolving, with a kind of sullen resignation, if such a term 
may be allowed, I wended my way to Ryecote Farm, scarcely expecting 
to find its owner within at this time of day, but hoping to learn in 
what part of the premises he was most likely to be found. 
</p>
               <p>Absent he was, but expected home in a few minutes; and I was desired 
to step into the parlour and wait. Mrs Wilson was busy in the 
kitchen, but the room was not empty; and I scarcely checked an 
involuntary recoil as I entered it; for there sat Miss Wilson 
chattering with Eliza Millward. However, I determined to be cool and 
civil. Eliza seemed to have made the same resolution on her part. We 
had not met since the evening of the tea-party; but there was no 
visible emotion either of pleasure or pain, no attempt at pathos, no 
display of injured pride: she was cool in temper, civil in 
demeanour. There was even an ease and cheerfulness about her air and 
manner that I made no pretension to; but there was a depth of malice 
in her too expressive eye, that plainly told me I was not forgiven; 
for, though she no longer hoped to win me to herself, she still 
hated her rival, and evidently delighted to wreak her spite on me. 
On the other hand, Miss Wilson was as affable and courteous as heart 
could wish and though I was in no very conversable humour myself, 
the two ladies between them managed to keep up a pretty continuous 
fire of small talk. But Eliza took advantage of the first convenient 
pause to ask if I had lately seen Mrs Graham, in a tone of merely 
casual inquiry, but with a sidelong glance—intended to be playfully 
mischievous—really, brimful and running over with malice. 
</p>
               <p>“Not lately,” I replied, in a careless tone, but sternly repelling 
her odious glances with my eyes; for I was vexed to feel the colour 
mounting to my forehead, despite my strenuous efforts to appear 
unmoved. 
</p>
               <p>“What! are you beginning to tire already? I thought so noble a 
creature would have power to attach you for a year at least!” 
</p>
               <p>“I would rather not speak of her now.” 
</p>
               <p>“Ah! then you are convinced at last, of your mistake—you have at 
length discovered that your divinity is not quite the 
immaculate—`' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>“I desired you not to speak of her, Miss Eliza.” 
</p>
               <p>“Oh, I beg your pardon! I perceive Cupid's arrows have been too 
sharp for you: the wounds being more than skin-deep, are not yet 
healed and bleed afresh at every mention of the loved one's 
name.” 
</p>
               <p>“Say rather,” interposed Miss Wilson, “that Mr Markham feels that 
name is unworthy to be mentioned in the presence of right. minded 
females. I wonder, Eliza, you should think of referring to that 
unfortunate person—you might know the mention of her would be 
anything but agreeable to anyone here present.” 
</p>
               <p>How could this be borne? I rose and was about to clap my hat upon my 
head and burst away, in wrathful indignation, from the house; but 
recollecting—just in time to save my dignity—the folly of such a 
proceeding, and how it would only give my fair tormentors a merry 
laugh at my expense, for the sake of one I acknowledged in my own 
heart to be unworthy of the slightest sacrifice—though the ghost of 
my former reverence and love so hung about me still, that I could 
not bear to hear her name aspersed by others—I merely walked to the 
window, and having spent a few seconds in vengeably biting my lips, 
and sternly repressing the passionate heavings of my chest, I 
observed to Miss Wilson that I could see nothing of her brother, and 
added that as my time was precious, it would perhaps be better to 
call again to-morrow, at some time when I should be sure to find him 
at home. 
</p>
               <p>“Oh no!” said she, “if you wait a minute, he will be sure to come; 
for he has business at L—`' (that was our market town) “and will 
require a little refreshment before he goes.” 
</p>
               <p>I submitted accordingly, with the best grace I could; and happily, I 
had not long to wait. Mr Wilson soon arrived, and indisposed for 
business as I was at that moment, and little as I cared for the 
field or its owner, I forced my attention to the matter in hand, 
with very creditable determination, and quickly concluded the 
bargain—perhaps more to the thrifty farmer's satisfaction than he 
cared to acknowledge. Then, leaving him to the discussion of his 
substantial “refreshment,” I gladly quitted the house, and went to 
look after my reapers. 
</p>
               <p>Leaving them busy at work on the side of the valley, I ascended the 
hill, intending to visit a cornfield in the more elevated regions, 
and see when it would be ripe for the sickle. But I did <hi>not</hi>
visit it that day; for, as I approached, I beheld at no great 
distance Mrs Graham and her son coming down in the opposite 
direction. They saw me; and Arthur, already, was running to meet me; 
but I immediately turned back and walked steadily homeward; for I 
had fully determined never to encounter his mother again; and 
regardless of the shrill voice in my ear, calling upon me to “wait a 
moment,” I pursued the even tenor of my way; and he soon 
relinquished the pursuit as hopeless, or was called away his mother. 
At all events, when I looked back, five minutes after, not a trace 
of either was to be seen. 
</p>
               <p>This incident agitated and disturbed me most unaccountably—unless 
you would account for it by saying that Cupid's arrows not only had 
been too sharp for me, but they were barbed and deeply rooted, and I 
had not yet been able to wrench them from my heart. However that be, 
I was rendered doubly miserable for the remainder of the day. 
</p>

               <head>An Assault</head>
               <p>NEXT morning, I bethought me, I, too, had business at L—; so I 
mounted my horse and set forth on the expedition, soon after 
breakfast. It was a dull, drizzly day; but that was no matter; it 
was all the more suitable to my frame of mind. It was likely to be a 
lonely journey; for it was no market-day, and the road I traversed 
was little frequented at any other time; but that suited me all the 
better too. 
</p>
               <p>As I trotted along, however, chewing the cud of—<hi>bitter</hi>
fancies, I heard another horse at no great distance behind me; but I 
never conjectured who the rider might be—or troubled my head about 
him, till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle acclivity—or 
rather suffering my horse to slacken its pace into a lazy walk; for, 
lost in my own reflexions, I was letting it jog on as leisurely as 
it thought proper—I lost ground, and my fellow-traveller overtook 
me. He accosted me by name; for it was no stranger—it was Mr 
Lawrence! Instinctively the fingers of my whip-hand tingled, and 
grasped their charge with convulsive energy; but I restrained the 
impulse, and answering his salutation with a nod, attempted to push 
on; but he pushed on beside me and began to talk about the weather 
and the crops. I gave the briefest possible answers to his queries 
and observations, and fell back. He fell back too, and asked if my 
horse was lame. I replied with a <hi>look</hi>—at which he placidly 
smiled. 
</p>
               <p>I was as much astonished as exasperated at this singular pertinacity 
and imperturbable assurance on his part. I had thought the 
circumstances of our last meeting would have left such an impression 
on his mind as to render him cold and distant ever after: instead of 
that, he appeared, not only to have forgotten all former offences, 
but to be impenetrable to all present incivilities. Formerly, the 
slightest hint, or mere fancied coldness in tone or glance, had 
sufficed to repulse him: now, positive rudeness could not drive him 
away. Had he heard of my disappointment; and was he come to witness 
the result, and triumph In my despair? I grasped my whip with more 
determined energy than before—but still forbore to raise it, and 
rode on in silence, waiting for some more tangible cause of offence, 
before I opened the floodgates of my soul, and poured out the 
dammed-up fury that was foaming and swelling within. 
</p>
               <p>`Markham,' said he, in his usual quiet tone, `why do you quarrel 
with your friends, because you have been disappointed in one 
quarter? You have found your hopes defeated; but how am I to blame 
for it? I warned you beforehand, you know, but you would not—' 
</p>
               <p>He said no more; for, impelled by some fiend at my elbow, I had 
seized my whip by the small end, and—swift and sudden as a flash of 
lightning—brought the other down upon his head. It was not without 
a feeling of savage satisfaction that I beheld the instant, deadly 
pallor that overspread his face, and the few red drops that trickled 
down his forehead, while he reeled a moment in his saddle, and then 
fell backward to the ground. The pony, surprised to be so strangely 
relieved of its burden, started and capered, and kicked a little, 
and then made use of its freedom to go and crop the grass of the 
hedge bank; while its master lay as still and silent as a corpse. 
Had I killed him?—an icy hand seemed to grasp my heart and check 
its pulsation, as I bent over him, gazing with breathless intensity 
upon the ghastly, upturned face. But no; he moved his eyelids and 
uttered a slight groan. I breathed again—he was only stunned-by the 
fall. It served him right—it would teach him better manners in 
future. Should I help him to his horse? No. For any other 
combination of offences I would; but his were too unpardonable. He 
might mount it himself, if he liked—in a while: already he was 
beginning to stir and look about him—and there it was for him, 
quietly browsing on the roadside. 
</p>
               <p>So with a muttered execration, I left the fellow to his fate, and 
clapping spurs to my own horse, galloped away, excited by a 
combination of feelings it would not be easy to analyse; and 
perhaps, if I did so, the result would not be very creditable to my 
disposition; for I am not sure that a species of exultation in what 
I had done was not one principal concomitant. 
</p>
               <p>Shortly, however, the effervescence began to abate, and not many 
minutes elapsed before I had turned and gone back to look after the 
fate of my victim. It was no generous impulse—no kind relentings 
that led me to this—nor even the fear of what might be the 
consequences to myself, if I finished my assault upon the squire by 
leaving him thus neglected, and exposed to further injury; it was, 
simply, the voice of conscience; and I took great credit to myself 
for attending so promptly to its dictates—and judging the merit of 
the deed by the sacrifice it cost, I was not far wrong. 
</p>
               <p>Mr Lawrence and his pony had both altered their positions in some 
degree. The pony had wandered eight or ten yards farther away; and 
he had managed, somehow, to remove himself from the middle of the 
road: I found him seated in a recumbent position on the 
bank,—looking very white and sickly still, and holding his cambric 
handkerchief (now more red than white) to his head. It must have 
been a powerful blow; but half the credit—or the blame of it (which 
you please)—must be attributed to the whip, which was garnished 
with a massive horse's head of plated metal. The grass, being sodden 
with rain, afforded the young gentleman a rather inhospitable couch; 
his clothes were considerably bemired; and his hat was rolling in 
the mud, on the other side of the road. But his thoughts seemed 
chiefly bent upon his pony, on which he was wistfully gazing—half 
in helpless anxiety, and half in hopeless abandonment to his 
fate. 
</p>
               <p>I dismounted, however, and having fastened my own animal to the 
nearest tree, first picked up his hat, intending to clap it on his 
head; but either he considered his head unfit for a hat, or the hat, 
in its present condition, unfit for his head; for shrinking away the 
one, he took the other from my hand, and scornfully cast it 
aside. 
</p>
               <p>`It's good enough for <hi>you</hi>,' I muttered. 
</p>
               <p>My next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him, which 
was soon accomplished; for the beast was quiet enough in the main, 
and only winced and flirted a trifle, till I got a hold of the 
bridle,—but then, I must see him in the saddle. 
</p>
               <p>`Here, you fellow—scoundrel—dog—give me your hand, and I'll help 
you to mount.' 
</p>
               <p>No; he turned from me in disgust. I attempted to take him by the 
arm. He shrank away as if there had been contamination in my 
touch. 
</p>
               <p>`What, you won't? Well! you may sit there till doomsday, for what I 
care. But I suppose you don't want to lose all the blood in your 
body—I'll just condescend to bind that up for you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Let me alone, if you please.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humph! with all my heart. You may go to the d—-l if you 
choose—and say I sent you.' 
</p>
               <p>But before I abandoned him to his fate, I flung his pony's bridle 
over a stake in the hedge, and threw him my handkerchief, as his own 
was now saturated with blood. He took it and cast it back to me, in 
abhorrence and contempt, with all the strength he could muster. It 
wanted but this to fill the measure of his offences. With 
execrations not loud but deep, I left him to live or die as he 
could, well satisfied that I had done my duty in attempting to save 
hun—but forgetting how I had erred in bringing him into such a 
condition, and how insultingly my after-services had been 
offered—and sullenly prepared to meet the consequences if he should 
choose to say I had attempted to murder him,—which I thought not 
unlikely, as it seemed probable he was actuated by some such 
spiteful motives in so perseveringly refusing my assistance. 
</p>
               <p>Having remounted my horse, I just looked back to see how he was 
getting on, before I rode away. He had risen from the ground, and 
grasping his pony's mane, was attempting to resume his seat in the 
saddle; but scarcely had he put his foot in the stirrup, when a 
sickness or dizziness seemed to overpower him: he leant forward a 
moment, with his head drooped on the animal's back, and then made 
one more effort, which proving ineffectual, he sank back on to the 
bank, where I left him, reposing his head on the oozy turf, and, to 
all appearance, as calmly reclining as if he had been taking his 
rest on the sofa at home. 
</p>
               <p>I ought to have helped him in spite of himself—to have bound up the 
wound he was unable to stanch, and insisted upon getting him on to 
his horse and seeing him safe home; but, besides my bitter 
indignation against himself, there was the question what to say to 
his servants,—and what to my own family. Either I should have to 
acknowledge the deed, which would set me down as a madman, unless I 
acknowledged the motive too—and that seemed impossible,—or I must 
get up a lie, which seemed equally out of the question—especially 
Mr Lawrence would probably reveal the whole truth, and thereby bring 
me to tenfold disgrace,—unless I were villain enough, prig on the 
absence of witnesses, to persist in my own version of the Case, and 
make him out a still greater scoundrel than he was. No; he had only 
received a cut above the temple, and perhaps a few bruises from the 
fall, or the hoofs of his own pony: that could not kill him if he 
lay there half the day; and, if he could not help himself, surely 
someone would be coming by: it would be impossible that a whole day 
should pass and no one traverse the road but ourselves. As for what 
he might choose to say hereafter, I would take my chance about it: 
if he told lies, I would contradict him; if he told the truth, I 
would bear it as I best could. I was not <hi>obliged</hi> to enter 
into explanations, further than I thought proper. Perhaps he might 
choose to be silent on the subject, for fear of raising enquiries as 
to the cause of the quarrel, and drawing the public attention to his 
connection with Mrs Graham, which, whether for her sake or his own, 
he seemed so very desirous to conceal. 
</p>
               <p>Thus reasoning, I trotted away to the town, where I duly transacted 
my business, and performed various little commissions for my mother 
and Rose, with very laudable exactitude, consIdering the different 
circumstances of the case. In returning home, I was troubled with 
sundry misgivings about the unfortunate Lawrence. The question, what 
if I should find him lying, still on the damp earth, fairly dying of 
cold and exhaustion—or already stark and chill? thrust itself most 
unpleasantly upon my mind, and the appalling possibility pictured 
itself with painful vividness to my imagination as I approached the 
spot where I had left him. But no; thank Heaven, both man and horse 
were gone, and nothing was left to witness against me but two 
objects—unpleasant enough in themselves, to be sure, and presenting 
a very ugly, not to say murderous, appearance—in one place, the hat 
saturated with rain and coated with mud, indented and broken above 
the brim by that villainous whip-handle; in another, the crimson 
handkerchief, soaking in a deeply tinctured pool of water—for much 
rain had fallen in the interim. 
</p>
               <p>Bad news fly fast: it was hardly four o'clock when I got home, but 
my mother gravely accosted me with— 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Gilbert!—<hi>Such</hi> an accident! Rose has been shopping in 
the village, and she's heard that Mr Lawrence has been thrown from 
his horse and brought home dying!' 
</p>
               <p>This shocked me a trifle, as you may suppose; but I was comforted to 
hear that he had frightfully fractured his skull and broken a leg; 
for, assured of the falsehood of this, I trusted the rest of the 
story was equally exaggerated; and when I heard my mother and sister 
so feelingly deploring his condition, I had considerable difficulty 
in preventing myself from telling them the real extent of the 
injuries, as far as I knew them. 
</p>
               <p>`You must go and see him to-morrow,' said my mother. 
</p>
               <p>`Or to-day,' suggested Rose: `there's plenty of time; and you can 
have the pony, if your horse is tired. Won't you, Gilbert—as soon 
as you've had something to eat?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no—How can we tell that it isn't all a false report? It's 
highly im—' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I'm sure it isn't; for the village is all alive about it; and I 
saw two people that had seen others that had seen the man that found 
him. That sounds far fetched; but it isn't so, when you think of 
it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but Lawrence is a good rider; it is not likely he would fall 
from his horse at all; and if he did, it is highly improbable he 
should break his bones in that way. It must be a gross exaggeration 
at least.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, but the horse kicked him—or something.' 
</p>
               <p>`What, his quiet little pony?' 
</p>
               <p>`How do you know it was that?' 
</p>
               <p>`He seldom rides any other.' 
</p>
               <p>`At any rate,' said my mother, `you will call to-morrow. Whether it 
be true or false, exaggerated or otherwise, we shall like to know 
how he is.' 
</p>
               <p>`Fergus may go. 
</p>
               <p>`Why not you?' 
</p>
               <p>`He has more time: I am busy just now.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! but Gilbert, how can you be so composed about it? You won't 
mind business, for an hour or two, in a case of this sort—when your 
friend is at the point of death!' 
</p>
               <p>`He is not, I tell you!' 
</p>
               <p>`For anything you know, he <hi>may</hi> be: you can't tell till you 
have seen him.—At all events, he must have met with some terrible 
accident, and you ought to see him: he'll take it very ~d of you if 
you don't.' 
</p>
               <p>`Confound it! I can't. He and I have not been on good terms, of 
late.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, my <hi>dear</hi> boy! Surely, surely, you are not so unforgiving 
as to carry your little differences to such a length as—' 
</p>
               <p>`Little differences, indeed!' I muttered. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but only remember the occasion! Think how-' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, well, don't bother me now—I'll see about it,' I replied. 
</p>
               <p>And my seeing about it was to send Fergus next morning, with my 
mother's compliments, to make the requisite enquiries; for, of 
course, my going was out of the question—or sending a message, 
either. He brought back intelligence that the young squire was laid 
up with the complicated evils of a broken head and Certain 
contusions (occasioned by a fall—of which he did not trouble 
himself to relate the particulars—and the subsequent misconduct of 
his horse), and a severe cold, the consequence of lying on the wet 
ground in the rain; but there were no broken bones, and no immediate 
prospects of dissolution. 
</p>
               <p>It was evident then, that, for Mrs Graham's sake, it was not his 
intention to criminate me.

               <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
               <head>An Encounter and Its Consequences</head>
               <p>THAT day was rainy like its predecessor; but towards evening it 
began to clear up a little, and the next morning was fair and 
promising. I was out on the hill with the reapers. A light wind 
swept over the corn; and all nature laughed in the sunshine. The 
lark was rejoicing among the silvery floating clouds. The late rain 
had so sweetly freshened and cleared the air, and washed the sky, 
and left such glittering gems on branch and blade, that not even the 
farmers could have the heart to blame it. But no ray of sunshine 
could reach my heart, no breeze could freshen it; nothing could fill 
the void my faith, and hope, and joy in Helen Gram had left, or 
drive away the keen regrets, and bitter dregs of lingering love that 
still oppressed it. 
</p>
               <p>While I stood, with folded arms, abstractedly gazing on the 
undulating swell of the corn not yet disturbed by the reapers, 
something gently pulled my skirts, and a small voice, no longer 
welcome to my ears, aroused me with the startling words:— 
</p>
               <p>`Mr Markham, mamma wants you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Wants <hi>me</hi>, Arthur?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes. Why do you look so queer?' said he, half laughing, half 
frightened at the unexpected aspect of my face in suddenly turning 
towards him—`and why have you kept so long away?—Come!—Won't you 
come?' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm busy just now,' I replied, scarce knowing what to answer. 
</p>
               <p>He looked up in childish bewilderment; but before I could speak 
again, the lady herself was at my side. 
</p>
               <p>`Gilbert, I <hi>must</hi> speak with you!' said she, in a tone of sub 
pressed vehemence. 
</p>
               <p>I looked at her pale cheek and glittering eye, but answered 
nothing. 
</p>
               <p>`Only for a moment,' pleaded she. `Just step aside into this other 
field,'—she glanced at the reapers, some of whom were directing 
looks of impertinent curiosity towards her—`I won't keep you a 
minute.' 
</p>
               <p>I accompanied her through the gap. 
</p>
               <p>`Arthur, darling, run and gather those bluebells,' said she, 
pointing to some that were gleaming, at some distance, under the 
hedge along which we walked. The child hesitated, as if unwilling to 
quit my side `Go love!' repeated she, more urgently, and in a tone, 
which, though not unkind, demanded prompt obedience, and obtained 
it. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Mrs Graham?' said I, calmly and coldly; for, though I saw she 
was miserable, and pitied her, I felt glad to have it in my power to 
torment her. 
</p>
               <p>She fixed her eyes upon me with a look that pierced me to the 
heart;—and yet it made me smile. 
</p>
               <p>`I don't ask the reason of this change, Gilbert,' said she, with 
bitter calmness.—`I know it too well; but though I could see myself 
suspected and condemned by everyone else, and bear it with calmness, 
I cannot endure it from you—Why did you not come to hear my 
explanation on the day I appointed to give it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because I happened, in the interim, to learn all you would have 
told me,—and a trifle more, I imagine.' 
</p>
               <p>`Impossible, for I would have told you all!' cried she, 
passionately—`But I won't now, for I see you are not worthy of 
it!' 
</p>
               <p>And her pale lips quivered with agitation. 
</p>
               <p>`Why not, may I ask?' 
</p>
               <p>She repelled my mocking smile with a glance of scornful 
indignation. 
</p>
               <p>`Because you never understood me, or you would not soon have 
listened to my traducers—my confidence would be misplaced in 
you—you are not the man I thought you—Go! I won't care what you 
think of me!' 
</p>
               <p>She turned away, and I went; for I thought that would torment her as 
much as anything; and I believe I was right; for, looking back a 
minute after, I saw her turn half round, as if hoping or egg to find 
me still beside her; and then she stood still, and cast one look 
behind. It was a look less expressive of anger than of bitter 
anguish and despair; but I immediately assumed an aspect of 
indifference, and affected to be gazing carelessly round me, and I 
suppose she went on; for after lingering awhile to see if she would 
come back or call, I ventured one more glance, and saw her a good 
way off, moving rapidly up the field with little Arthur running by 
her side and apparently talking as he went; but she kept her face 
averted from him, as if to hide some uncontrollable emotion. And I 
returned to my business. 
</p>
               <p>But I soon began to regret my precipitancy in leaving her so soon It 
was evident she loved me—probably she was tired of Mr Lawrence, and 
wished to exchange him for me; and if I had loved and reverenced her 
less to begin with, the preference might have gratified and amused 
me; but now, the contrast between her out+ward seeming and her 
inward mind, as I supposed,—between my former and my present 
opinion of her, was so harrowing—so distressing to my feelings, 
that it swallowed up every lighter consideration. 
</p>
               <p>But still I was curious to know what sort of an explanation she 
would have given me,—or would give now, if I pressed hem for 
it—how much she would confess, and how she would endeavour to 
excuse herself. I longed to know what to despise, and what to admire 
in her, how much to pity, and how much to hate;—and, what was more, 
I <hi>would</hi> know. I would see her once more, and fairly satisfy 
myself in what light to regard her, before we parted. Lost to me she 
was, for ever, of course; but still I could not bear to think that 
we had parted, for the last time, with so much unkindness and misery 
on both sides. That last look of hen had sunk into my heart; I could 
not forget it—But what a fool I was!—Had she not deceived me, 
injured me—blighted my happiness for life?—`Well, I'll see her, 
however,' was my concluding resolve,—`but not to-day: to-day and 
to-night, she may think upon her sins, and be as miserable as she 
will: tomorrow, I will see her once again, and know something more 
about her. The interview may be serviceable to her, or it may 
not.—At any rate, it will give a breath of excitement to the life 
she has doomed to stagnation, and may with certainty some agitating 
thoughts.' 
</p>
               <p>I did go on the morrow; but not till towards evening, after the 
business of the day was concluded, that is between six and seven; 
and the westering sun was gleaming redly on the old hall, and 
flaming in the latticed windows, as I reached it, imparting to the 
place a chess not its own. I need not dilate upon the feelings with 
which I approached the shrine of my former divinity—that spot 
teeming with a thousand delightful recollections and glorious 
dreams—all darkened now, by one disastrous truth. 
</p>
               <p>Rachel admitted me into the parlour, and went to call her mistress, 
for she was not there; but there was her desk left open on the 
little round table beside the high-backed chair, with a book laid 
upon it. Her limited but choice collection of books was almost as 
familiar to me as my own; but this volume I had not seen before. I 
took it up. It was Sir Humphrey Davy's `Last days of a Philosopher,' 
and on the first leaf was written,—`Frederick Lawrence.' I closed 
the book, but kept it in my hand, and stood facing the door, with my 
back to the fireplace, calmly waiting her arrival; for I did not 
doubt she would come. And soon I heard her step in the hall. My 
heart was berg to throb, but I checked it with an internal rebuke, 
and maintained my composure—outwardly, at least, She entered, calm, 
pale, collected. 
</p>
               <p>`To what am I indebted for this favour, Mr Markham?' said she, with 
such severe but quiet dignity as almost disconcerted me; but I 
answered with a smile, and impudently enough:— 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I am come to hear your explanation.' 
</p>
               <p>`I told you I would not give it,' said she. `I said you were 
unworthy of my confidence.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, very well,' replied I, moving to the door. 
</p>
               <p>`Stay a moment,' said she. `This is the last time I shall see you: 
don't go just yet.' 
</p>
               <p>I remained, awaiting her further commands. 
</p>
               <p>Tell me,' resumed she, `on what grounds you believe these things 
against me; who told you? and what did they say?' 
</p>
               <p>I paused a moment. She met my eye as unflinchingly as if her bosom 
had been steeled with conscious innocence. She was resolved to know 
the worst, and determined to dare it too. `I can crush that bold 
spirit,' thought I. But while I secretly exulted in my power, I felt 
disposed to dally with my victim like a cat. Showing her the book 
that I still held in my hand, and pointing to the name on the 
flyleaf, but fixing my eye upon her face, I asked,— 
</p>
               <p>`Do you know that gentleman?' 
</p>
               <p>`Of course I do,' replied she; and a sudden flush suffused her 
features—whether of shame or anger I could not tell: it rather 
resembled the latter. `What next, sir?' 
</p>
               <p>`How long is it since you saw him?' 
</p>
               <p>`Who gave you the right to catechise me, on this or any other 
subject?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no one!—it's quite at your option whether to answer or 
not.—And now, let me ask—have you heard what has lately befallen 
this friend of yours?—because, if you have not—' 
</p>
               <p>`I will not be insulted, Mr Markham!' cried she, almost infuriated 
at my manner—`So you had better leave the house at once, if you 
came only for that.' 
</p>
               <p>`I did not come to insult you: I came to hear your explanation.' 
</p>
               <p>`And I tell you I won't give it!' retorted she, pacing the room in a 
state of strong excitement, with her hands clasped tightly together, 
breathing short, and flashing fires of indignation from her eyes. `I 
will not condescend to explain myself to one that can make a jest of 
such horrible suspicions, and be so easily led to entertain 
them.' 
</p>
               <p>`I do not make a jest of them, Mrs Graham,' returned I, dropping at 
once my tone of taunting sarcasm.' I heartily wish I could find them 
a jesting matter! And as to being easily led to suspect, God only 
knows what a blind, incredulous fool I have hitherto been, 
perseveringly shutting my eyes and stopping my ears against 
everything that threatened to shake my confidence in you, till proof 
itself confounded my infatuation!' 
</p>
               <p>`What proof, sir?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I'll tell you. You remember that evening when I was here 
last?' 
</p>
               <p>`I do.' 
</p>
               <p>`Even then, you dropped some hints that might have opened the eyes 
of a wiser man; but they had no such effect upon me: I went on 
trusting and believing, hoping against hope, and adoring where I 
could not comprehend—It so happened, however, that after I had left 
you, I turned back—drawn by pure depth of sympathy, and ardour of 
affection—not daring to intrude my presence openly upon you, but 
unable to resist the temptation of catching one glimpse through the 
window, just to see how you were; for I had left you apparently in 
great affliction, and I partly blamed my own want of forbearance and 
discretion as the cause of it. If I did wrong, love alone was my 
incentive, and the punishment was severe enough; for it was just as 
I had reached that tree, that you came out into the garden with your 
friend. Not choosing to show myself, under the circumstances, I 
stood still, in the shadow, till you had both passed by.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`And how much of our conversation did you hear?' 
</p>
               <p>`I heard quite enough, Helen. And it was well for me that I did hear 
it; for nothing less could have cured my infatuation. I always said 
and thought, that I would never believe a word against you, unless I 
heard it from your own lips. All the hints and affirmations of 
others I treated as malignant, baseless slanders; your own 
self-accusations I believed to be overstrained; and all that seemed 
unaccountable in your position, I trusted that you could account for 
if you chose.' 
</p>
               <p>Mrs Graham had discountinued her walk. She leant against one end of 
the chimney-piece, opposite that near which I was standing, with her 
chin resting on her closed hand, her eyes—no longer burning with 
anger, but gleaming with restless excitement—sometimes glancing at 
me while I spoke, then coursing the opposite wall, or fixed upon the 
carpet. 
</p>
               <p>`You should have come to me, after all,' said she, `and heard what I 
had to say in my own justification. It was ungenerous and wrong to 
withdraw yourself so secretly and suddenly, immediately after such 
ardent protestations of attachment, without ever assigning a reason 
for the change. You should have told me all—no matter <hi>how</hi>
bitterly—It would have been better than this silence.' 
</p>
               <p>`To what end should I have done so?—You could not have enlightened 
me farther, on the subject which alone concerned me; nor could you 
have made me discredit the evidence of my senses. I desired our 
intimacy to be discontinued at once, as you yourself had 
acknowledged would probably be the case if I knew all; but I did not 
wish to upbraid you,—though (as you also acknowledged) you had 
deeply wronged me—Yes; you have done me an injury you can never 
repair—or any other either—you have blighted the freshness and 
promise of youth, and made my life a wilderness! I might live a 
hundred years, but I could never recover from the effects of this 
withering blow—and never forget it! Hereafter—You smile, Mrs 
Graham,' said I, suddenly stopping short, checked in my passionate 
declamation by unutterable feelings to behold her actually 
<hi>smiling</hi> at the picture of the ruin she had wrought. 
</p>
               <p>`Did I?' replied she, looking seriously up, `I was not aware of it. 
If I did, it was not for pleasure at the thought of the had I had 
done you.—Heaven knows I have had torment enough at the bare 
possibility of that!—`it was for joy to find that you had some 
depth of soul and feeling after all, and to hope that I had not been 
utterly mistaken in your worth. But smiles and tears are so alike 
with me; they are neither of them confined to any particular 
feelings: I often cry when I am happy, and smile when I am sad.' 
</p>
               <p>She looked at me again, and seemed to expect a reply; but I 
continued silent. 
</p>
               <p>`Would you be <hi>very</hi> glad,' resumed she, `to find that you were 
mistaken in your conclusions?' 
</p>
               <p>`How can you ask it, Helen?' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't say I can clear myself altogether,' said she, speaking low 
and fast, while her heart beat visibly and her bosom heaved with 
excitement,—`but would you be glad to discover I was better than 
you think me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Anything that could, in the least degree, tend to restore my former 
opinion of you, to excuse the regard I still feel for you, and 
alleviate the pangs of unutterable regret that accompany it, would 
be only too gladly—too eagerly received!' 
</p>
               <p>Her cheeks bad and her whole frame trembled, now, with excess of 
agitation. She did not speak, but flew to her desk, and matching 
thence what seemed a thick album or manuscript volume, hastily tore 
away a few leaves from the end, and thrust the rest into my hand, 
saying, `You needn't read it all; but take it home with you,'—and 
hurried from the roof But when I had left the house, and was 
proceeding down the walk, she opened the window and called me back. 
It was only to say,— 
</p>
               <p>`Bring it back when you have read it; and don't breathe a word of 
what it tells you to any living being—I trust to your honour.' 
</p>
               <p>Before I could answer, she had closed the casement and turned away. 
I saw her cast herself back in the old oak chair, and cover her face 
with her hands. Her feelings had been wrought to a pitch that 
rendered it necessary to seek relief in tears. 
</p>
               <p>Panting with eagerness, and struggling to suppress my hopes, I 
hurried home, and rushed upstairs to my room,—having first provided 
myself with a candle, though it was scarcely twilight yet,—then, 
shut and bolted the door, determined to tolerate no interruption, 
and sitting down before the table, opened out my prize and delivered 
myself up to its perusal—first, hastily turning over the leaves and 
snatching a sentence hem and there, and then, setting myself 
steadily to read it through. 
</p>
               <p>I have it now before me; and though you could not, of course, peruse 
it with half the interest that I did, I know you would not be 
satisfied with an abbreviation of its contents, and you shall have 
the `whole, save, perhaps, a few passages here and there of merely 
temporal interest to the writer, or such as would serve to encumber 
the story rather than elucidate it, It begins somewhat abruptly, 
thus—but we will reserve its commencement for another chapter, and 
call it,—

               <head>CHAPTER XVI</head>
               <head>The Warnings of Experience</head>
               <p>June 1st, 1821.—We have just returned to Staningley—that is, we 
returned some days ago, and I am not yet settled, and feel as if I 
never should be. We left town sooner than was intended, in 
consequence of my uncle's indisposition—I wonder what would have 
been the result if we had stayed the full time. I am quite ashamed 
of my new-sprung distaste for country life. All my former 
occupations seem so tedious and dull, my former amusements so 
insipid and unprofitable. I cannot enjoy my music, because there is 
no one to hear it. I cannot enjoy my walks, because there is no one 
to meet. I cannot enjoy my books, because they have not power to 
arrest my attention: my head is so haunted with the recollections of 
the last few weeks that I cannot attend to them. My drawing suits me 
best, for I can draw and think at the same time; and if my 
productions cannot now be seen by anyone but myself and those who do 
not care about them, they possibly may be, hereafter. But then, 
there is one face I am always trying to paint or to sketch, and 
always without success; and that vexes me. As for the owner of that 
face, I cannot get him out of my mind—and, indeed, I never try. I 
wonder whether he ever thinks of me; and I wonder whether I shall 
ever see him again. And then might follow a train of other 
wonderments—questions for time and fate to answer, concluding 
with:—supposing all the rest be answered in the affirmative, I 
wonder whether I shall ever repent it—as my aunt would tell me I 
should, if she knew what I was thinking about. How distinctly I 
remember our conversation that evening before our departure for 
town, when we were sitting together over the fire, my uncle having 
gone to bed with a slight attack of the gout. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen,' said she, after a thoughtful silence, `do you ever think 
about marriage?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, aunt, often.' 
</p>
               <p>`And do you ever contemplate the possibility of being married 
yourself, or engaged, before the season is over?' 
</p>
               <p>`Sometimes; but I don't think it at all likely that I <hi>ever</hi>
shall.'  `Why so?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because I imagine there must be only a very, very few men in the 
world, that I should like to marry; and of those few, it is ten to 
one I may never be acquainted with one; or if I should, it is twenty 
to one he may not happen to be single, or to take a fancy to me.' 
</p>
               <p>`That is no argument at all. It may be very true—and I hope is 
true, that there are very few men whom you would choose to marry, of 
yourself—It is not, indeed, to be supposed that you would 
<hi>wish</hi> to marry <hi>anyone</hi>, till you were asked: a girl's 
affections should never be won unsought. But when they are 
sought—when the citadel of the heart is fairly besieged, it is apt 
to surrender sooner than the owner is aware of, and often against 
her better judgment, and in opposition to all her preconceived ideas 
of what she could have loved, unless she be extremely careful and 
discreet. Now I want to warn you, Helen, of these things, and to 
exhort you to be watchful and circumspect from the very commencement 
of your career, and not to suffer your heart to be stolen from you 
by the first foolish or unprincipled person that covets the 
possession of it.—You know, my dear, you are only just eighteen; 
there is plenty of time before you, and neither your uncle nor I are 
in any hurry to get you off our hands; and, I may venture to say, 
there will be no lack of suitors; for you can boast a good family, a 
pretty considerable fortune and expectations, and, I may as well 
tell you likewise—for if I don't others will—that you have a fair 
share of beauty, besides—and I hope you may never have cause to 
regret it!—' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope not, aunt; but why should, you fear it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because, my dear, beauty is that quality which, next to money, is 
generally the most attractive to the worst kinds of men; and, 
therefore, it is likely to entail a great deal of trouble on the 
possessor.' 
</p>
               <p>`Have <hi>you</hi> been troubled in that way, aunt?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Helen,' said she, with reproachful gravity, `but I know many 
that have; and some, through carelessness, have been the wretched 
victims of deceit; and some, through weakness, have fallen into 
snares and temptations terrible to relate' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I shall be neither careless nor weak.' 
</p>
               <p>`Remember Peter, Helen! Don't boast, but <hi>watch</hi>. Keep a guard 
over your eyes and ears as the inlets of your heart, and over your 
lips as the outlet, lest they betray you in a moment of unwariness. 
Receive, coldly and dispassionately, every attention, till you have 
ascertained and duly considered the worth of the aspirant; and let 
your affections be consequent upon approbation alone. First study; 
then approve; then love. let your eyes be blind to all external 
attractions, your ears deaf to all the fascinations of Battery and 
light discourse.—These are nothing—and worse than nothing—snares 
and wiles of the tempter, to lure the thoughtless to their own 
destruction. Principle is the first thing, after all; and next to 
that, good sense, respectability, and moderate wealth. If you should 
marry the handsomest, and most accomplished and superficially 
agreeable man in the world, you little know the misery that would 
overwhelm you, if, after all, you should find him to be a worthless 
reprobate, or even an impracticable fool.' 
</p>
               <p>`But what are all the poor fools and reprobates to do, aunt? If 
everybody followed your advice the world would soon come to an 
end.' 
</p>
               <p>`Never fear, my dear! the male fools and reprobates will never want 
for partners while there are so many of the other sex to match them; 
but do you follow my advice. And this is no subject for jesting, 
Helen; I am sorry to see you treat the matter in that light way. 
Believe me, <hi>matrimony is a serious thing</hi>.' And she spoke it 
so seriously that one might have fancied she had known it to her 
cost; but I asked no more impertinent questions, and merely 
answered,— 
</p>
               <p>`I know it is; and I know there is truth and sense in what you say; 
but you need not fear me, for I not only should think it 
<hi>wrong</hi> to marry a man that was deficient in sense or in 
principle, but I should never be <hi>tempted</hi> to do it; for I 
could not like him, if he were ever so handsome and ever so charming 
in other respects; I should hate him—despise him—pity 
him—anything but love him. My affections not only ought to be 
founded on approbation, but they will and must be so: for without 
approving I cannot love. It is needless to say I ought to be able to 
respect and honour the man I marry as <hi>well</hi> as love him, for I 
cannot love him without. So set your mind at rest.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope it may be so,' answered she. 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>know</hi> it <hi>is</hi> so,' persisted I. 
</p>
               <p>`You have not been tried yet, Helen: we call but hope,' said she, in 
her cold, cautious way. 
</p>
               <p>`I was vexed at her incredulity; but I am not sure her doubts were 
entirely without sagacity; I fear I have found it much easier to 
remember her advice than to profit by it—Indeed, I have sometimes 
been led to question the soundness of her doctrines on those 
subjects. Her counsels may be good, as far as they go—in the main 
points, at least;—but there are some things she has overlooked in 
her calculations. I wonder if <hi>she</hi> was ever in love. 
</p>
               <p>I commenced my career—or my first campaign, as my uncle calls 
it—kindling with bright hopes and fancies—chiefly raised by this 
conversation—and full of confidence in my own discretion. At first, 
I was delighted with the novelty and excitement of our London life; 
but soon, I began to weary of its mingled turbulence and constraint, 
and sigh for the freshness and freedom of home. My new 
acquaintances, both male and female, disappointed my expectations, 
and vexed and depressed me by turns; for I soon grew tired of 
studying their peculiarities, and laughing at their 
foibles—particularly as I was obliged to keep my criticisms to 
myself, for my aunt would not hear them—and they—the ladies 
especially—appeared so provokingly mindless, and heartless, and 
artificial. The gentlemen seemed better, but perhaps it was because 
I knew them less, perhaps because they flattered me; but I did not 
fall in love with any of them, and if their attentions pleased me 
one moment, they provoked me the next, because they put me out of 
humour with myself, by revealing my vanity and making me fear I was 
becoming like some of the ladies I so heartily despised. 
</p>
               <p>There was one elderly gentleman that annoyed me very much; a rich 
old friend of my uncle's, who, I believe, thought I could not do 
better than marry him; but, besides being old, he was ugly and 
disagreeable,—and wicked, I am sure, though my aunt scolded me for 
saying so; but she allowed he was no saint. And there was another, 
less hateful, but still <hi>more</hi> tiresome, because she favoured 
him, and was always thrusting him upon me, and song his praises in 
my ears, Mr Boarham, by name, Bore'em as I prefer spelling it, for a 
terrible bore he was: I shudder still, at the remembrance of his 
voice, drone, drone, drone, in my ear, while he sat beside me, 
prosing away by the half-hour together, and beguiling himself with 
the notion that he was improving my mind by useful information, or 
impressing his dogmas upon me, and reforming my errors of judgment, 
or, perhaps, that he was talking down to my level, and amusing me 
with entertaining discourse. Yet he was a decent man enough, in the 
main, I dare say; and if he had kept his distance, I never would 
have hated him. As it was, it was almost impossible to help it; for 
he not only bothered me with the infliction of his own presence, but 
he kept me from the enjoyment of more agreeable society. 
</p>
               <p>One night, however, at a ball, he had been more than usually 
tormenting, and my patience was quite exhausted.—It appeared as if 
the whole evening was fated to be insupportable: I had just had one 
dance with an empty-headed coxcomb, and then Mr Boarham had come 
upon me, and seemed determined to cling to me for the rest of the 
night. He never danced himself, and there he sat, poking his head in 
my face, and impressing all beholders with the idea that he was a 
confirmed, acknowledged lover; my aunt looking complacently on, all 
the time, and wishing him God-speed. In vain I attempted to drive 
him away by giving a loose to my exasperated feelings, even to 
positive rudeness: nothing could convince him that his presence was 
disagreeable. Sullen silence was taken for rapt attention, and gave 
him greater room to talk; sharp answers were received as smart 
sallies of girlish vivacity, that only required an indulgent rebuke; 
and flat contradictions were but as oil to the flames, calling forth 
new strains of argument to support his dogmas, and bringing down 
upon me endless floods of reasoning to overwhelm me with 
conviction. 
</p>
               <p>But there was one present who seemed to have a better appreciation 
of my frame of mind. A gentleman stood by, who had been watching our 
conference for some time, evidently much amused at my companion's 
remorseless pertinacity and my manifest annoyance, and laughing to 
himself at the asperity and uncompromising spirit of my replies. At 
length, however, he withdrew, and went to the lady of the house, 
apparently for the purpose of asking an introduction to me, for, 
shortly after, they both came up, and she introduced him as Mr 
Huntingdon, the son of a late friend of my uncle's. He asked me to 
dance. I gladly consented, of course; and he was my companion during 
the remainder of my stay, which was not long, for my aunt, as usual, 
insisted upon an early departure. 
</p>
               <p>I was sorry to go, for I had found my new acquaintance a very lively 
and entertaining companion. There was a certain graceful ease and 
freedom about all he said and did, that gave a sense of repose and 
expansion to the mind, after so much constraint and formality as I 
had been doomed to suffer. There might be, it is true, a little too 
much careless boldness in his manner and address, but I was in so 
good a humour, and so grateful for my late deliverance from Mr 
Boarham, that it did not anger me. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Helen, how do you like Mr Boarham now?' said my aunt, as we 
took our seats in the carriage and drove away. 
</p>
               <p>`Worse than ever,' I replied. 
</p>
               <p>She looked displeased but said no more on that subject. 
</p>
               <p>`Who was the gentleman you danced with last,' resumed she, after a 
pause—`that was so officious in helping you on with your shawl?' 
</p>
               <p>`He was not officious at all, aunt: he never <hi>attempted</hi> to 
help me, till he saw Mr Boarham coming to do so; and then he stepped 
laughingly forward and said, “Come, I'll preserve you from that 
infliction.”' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`Who was it, I ask?' said she, with frigid gravity. 
</p>
               <p>`It was Mr Huntingdon, the son of uncle's old friend.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have heard your uncle speak of young Mr Huntingdon. I've heard 
him say, “He's a fine lad, that young Huntingdon, but a bit wildish 
I fancy.” So I'd have you beware.' 
</p>
               <p>`What does “a bit wildish” mean?' I enquired. 
</p>
               <p>`It means destitute of principle, and prone to every vice that is 
common to youth.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I've heard uncle say he was a sad wild fellow himself, when he 
was young.' 
</p>
               <p>She sternly shook her head. 
</p>
               <p>`He was jesting then, I suppose,' said I, `and here he was speaking 
at random—at least, I cannot believe there is any harm in those 
laughing blue eyes.' 
</p>
               <p>`False reasoning, Helen!' said she, with a sigh. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, we ought to be charitable, you know, aunt—besides, I don't 
think it is false: I am an excellent physiognomist, and I always 
judge of people's characters by their looks—not by whether they are 
handsome or ugly, but by the general cast of the countenance. For 
instance, I should know by your countenance that you were not of a 
cheerful, sanguine disposition; and I should know by Mr Wilmot's 
that he was a worthless old reprobate, and by Mr Boarham's that he 
was not an agreeable companion, and by Mr Huntingdon's that he was 
neither a fool nor a knave, though, possibly, neither a sage nor a 
saint—but that is no matter to me, as I am not likely to meet him 
again—unless as an occasional partner in the ballroom. 
</p>
               <p>It was not so, however, for I met him again next morning. He came to 
call upon my uncle, apologizing for not having done so before, by 
saying he was only lately returned from the continent, and had not 
heard, till the previous night, of my uncle's arrival in town; and 
after that, I often met him; sometimes in public, sometimes at home; 
for he was very assiduous in paying his respects to his old friend, 
who did not, however, consider himself greatly obliged by the 
attention. 
</p>
               <p>`I wonder what the deuce the lad means by coming so often,' he would 
say,—`can <hi>you</hi> tell, Helen?—Hey? He wants none o' my 
company, nor I his—that's certain.' 
</p>
               <p>`I wish you'd tell him so, then,' said my aunt. 
</p>
               <p>Why, what for? If I don't want him, somebody does mayhap (winking at 
me). Besides, he's a pretty tidy fortune, Peggy, you know—not such 
a catch as Wilmot, but then Helen won't hear of that match; for, 
somehow, these old chaps don't go down with the girls—with 
<hi>all</hi> their money—and their experience to boot. I'll bet 
anything she'd rather have this young fellow without a penny, than 
Wilmot with his house full of gold—Wouldn't you, Nell?' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`Yes, uncle; but that's not saying much for Mr Huntingdon, for I'd 
rather be an old maid and a pauper, than Mrs Wilmot.' 
</p>
               <p>`And Mrs Huntingdon? bat would you rather be than Mrs Huntingdon? 
eh?' 
</p>
               <p>`I'll tell you when I've considered the matter.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! it needs consideration then—But come now—would you rather be 
an old maid—let alone the pauper?' 
</p>
               <p>`I can't tell till I'm asked.' 
</p>
               <p>And I left the room immediately, to escape further examination. But 
five minutes after, in looking from my window, I beheld Mr Boarham 
coming up to the door. I waited nearly half an hour in uncomfortable 
suspense, expecting every minute to be called, and vainly longing to 
hear him go. Then, footsteps were heard on the stairs, and my aunt 
entered the room with a solemn countenance, and closed the door 
behind her. 
</p>
               <p>`Here is Mr Boarham, Helen,' said she. `He wishes to see you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, aunt! Can't you tell him I'm indisposed?—I'm sure I am—to see 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Nonsense, my dear! this is no trifling matter. He is come on a very 
important errand—to ask your hand in marriage, of your uncle and 
me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope my uncle and you told him it was not in your power to give 
it. What right had he to ask <hi>anyone</hi> before me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Helen!' 
</p>
               <p>`What did my uncle say?' 
</p>
               <p>`He said he would not interfere in the matter; if you liked to 
accept Mr Boarham's obliging offer, you—' 
</p>
               <p>`Did he say obliging offer?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; he said if you liked to take him you might; and if not, you 
might please yourself.' 
</p>
               <p>`He said right; and what did you say?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is no matter what I said. What will you say?—that is the 
question. He is now waiting to ask you himself; but consider well 
before you go; and if you intend to refuse him, give me your 
reasons.' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>shall</hi> refuse him, of course, but you must tell me how, for 
I want to be civil and yet decided—and when I've got rid of him, 
I'll give you my reasons afterwards.' 
</p>
               <p>`But stay, Helen; sit down a little, and compose yourself. Mr 
Boarham is in no particular hurry, for he has little doubt of your 
acceptance; and I want to speak with you. Tell me, my dear, what are 
your objections to him? Do you deny that he is all upright, 
honourable man?' 
</p>
               <p>`No.' 
</p>
               <p>`Do you deny that be is a sensible, sober, respectable?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; he may be all this, but—' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>But</hi>, Helen! How many such men do you expect to meet with in 
the world? Upright, honourable, sensible, sober, respectable!—Is 
this such an everyday character that you should reject the possessor 
of such noble qualities, without a moment's hesitation?—Yes, 
<hi>noble</hi> I may call them; for, think of the full meaning of 
each, and how many inestimable virtues they include (and I might add 
many more to the list), and consider that all this is laid at your 
feet: it is in your power to secure this inestimable blessing for 
life—a worthy and excellent husband, who loves you tenderly, but 
not too fondly so as to blind him to your faults, and will be your 
guide throughout life's pilgrimage, and your partner in eternal 
bliss! Think how—' 
</p>
               <p>`But I hate him, aunt,' said I, interrupting this unusual flow of 
eloquence. 
</p>
               <p>`Hate him, Helen! Is this a Christian spirit?—you hate him?—and he 
so good a man!' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't hate him as a man, but as a husband. As a man, I love him 
so much, that I wish him a better wife than I—one as good as 
himself, or better—if you think that possible—provided she could 
like him;—but I never could, and therefore—' 
</p>
               <p>`But why not? What objection do you find?' 
</p>
               <p>`Firstly, he is, at least, forty years old—considerably more I 
should think, and I am but eighteen; secondly, he is narrow-minded 
and bigoted in the extreme; thirdly, his tastes and feelings are 
wholly dissimilar to mine; fourthly, his looks, voice, and manner 
are particularly displeasing to me; and finally, I have an aversion 
to his whole person that I never can surmount.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you ought to surmount it! And please to compare him for a 
moment with Mr Huntingdon, and, good looks apart (which contribute 
nothing to the merit of the man, or to the happiness of married 
life, and which you have so often professed to hold in light 
esteem), tell me which is the better man.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have no doubt Mr Huntingdon is a much better man than you think 
him,—but we are not talking about him, now, but about Mr Boarham; 
and as I would rather grow, live, and die in single blessedness than 
be his wife' it il but right that I should tell him so at once, and 
put him out of suspense—so let me go.' 
</p>
               <p>`But don't give him a flat denial; he has no idea of such a thing, 
and it would offend him greatly: say you have no thoughts of 
matrimony, at present—' 
</p>
               <p>`But I <hi>have</hi> thoughts of it.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`Or that you desire a further acquaintance.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I don't desire a further acquaintance—quite the contrary.' 
</p>
               <p>And without waiting for further admonitions, I left the room, and 
went to seek Mr Boarham. He was walking up and down the 
drawing-room, humming snatches of tunes, and nibbling the end of his 
cane. 
</p>
               <p>`My dear young lady,' said he, bowing and smirking with great 
complacency. `I have your kind guardian's permission—' 
</p>
               <p>`I know, sir,' said I, wishing to shorten the scene as much as 
possible, `and I am greatly obliged for your preference, but must 
beg to decline the honour you wish to confer; for, I think, we were 
not made for each other—as you yourself would shortly discover if 
the experiment were tried.' 
</p>
               <p>My aunt was right: it was quite evident he had had little doubt of 
my acceptance, and no idea of a positive denial. He was 
amazed—astounded at such an answer, but too incredulous to be much 
offended; and after a little humming and hawing, he returned to the 
attack. 
</p>
               <p>`I know, my dear, that there exists a considerable disparity between 
us in years, in temperament, and perhaps some other things, but let 
me assure you, I shall not be severe to mark the faults and foibles 
of a young and ardent nature such as yours, and while I acknowledge 
them to myself, and even rebuke them with all a father's care, 
believe me, no youthful lover could be more tenderly indulgent 
towards the object of his affections, than I to you; and, on the 
other hand, let me hope that my more experienced years and graver 
habits of reflection will be no disparagement in your eyes, as I 
shall endeavour to make them all conducive to your happiness. Come 
now! What do you say?—let us have no young lady's affectations and 
caprices, but speak out at once!' 
</p>
               <p>`I will, but only to repeat what I said before, that I am certain we 
were not made for each other.' 
</p>
               <p>`You really think so?' 
</p>
               <p>`I do.' 
</p>
               <p>`But you don't know me—you wish for a further acquaintance—a 
longer time to—' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I don't. I know you as well as I ever shall, and better than 
you know me, or you would never dream of uniting yourself to one so 
incongruous—so utterly unsuitable to you in every way.' 
</p>
               <p>`But my dear young lady, I don't look for perfection, I can 
excuse—' 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you, Mr Boarham, but I won't trespass upon your goodness. You 
may save your indulgence and consideration for some more worthy 
object, that won't tax them so heavily.' 
</p>
               <p>`But let me beg you to consult your aunt; that excellent lady, I am 
sure, will—' 
</p>
               <p>`I have consulted her; and I know her wishes coincide with yours; 
but in such important matters, I take the liberty of judging for 
myself; and no persuasion can alter my inclinations, or induce me to 
believe that such a step would be conducive to my happiness, or 
yours—and I wonder that a man of your experience and discretion 
should think of choosing such a wife.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah, well!' said he—`I have sometimes wondered at that myself. I 
have sometimes said to myself, “Now Boarham, what is this you're 
after? Take care, man—look before you leap! This is a sweet, 
bewitching creature, but remember, the brightest attractions to the 
lover too often prove the husband's greatest torments!”—I assure 
you my choice has not been made without much reasoning and 
reflection. The seeming imprudence of the match has cost me many an 
anxious thought by day, and many a sleepless hour by night; but at 
length, I satisfied myself that it was not, in very deed, imprudent. 
I saw my sweet girl was not without her faults, but of these, her 
youth, I trusted, was not one, but rather an earnest of virtues yet 
unblown—a strong ground of presumption that her little defects of 
temper, and errors of judgment, opinion, or manner were not 
irremediable, but might easily be removed or mitigated by the 
patient efforts of a watchful and judicious adviser, and where I 
failed to enlighten and control, I thought I might safely undertake 
to pardon, for the sake of her many excellencies. Therefore, my 
dearest girl, since I am satisfied, why should you object—on my 
account, at least.' 
</p>
               <p>`But to tell you the truth, Mr Boarham, it is on my own account I 
principally object; so let us—drop the subject,' I would have said, 
`for it is worse than useless to pursue it any farther,' but he 
pertinaciously interrupted me with— 
</p>
               <p>`But why so? I would love you, cherish you, protect you, etc., 
etc.' 
</p>
               <p>I shall not trouble myself to put down all that passed between us. 
Suffice it to say, that I found him very troublesome, and very hard 
to convince that I really meant what I said, and really was so 
obstinate and blind to my own interests, that there was no shadow of 
a chance that either he or my aunt would ever be able to overcome my 
objections. Indeed, I am not sure that I succeeded after all, though 
wearied with his so pertinaciously returning to the same point and 
repeating the same arguments over and over again, forcing me to 
reiterate the same replies, I at length turned short and sharp upon 
him, and my last words were— 
</p>
               <p>`I tell you plainly, that it cannot be. No consideration can induce 
me to marry against my inclinations. I respect you—at least, I 
would respect you, if you would behave like a sensible man—but I 
cannot love you, and never could—and the more you talk the farther 
you repel me; so pray don't say any more about it.' 
</p>
               <p>Whereupon, he wished me a good morning and withdrew, disconcerted 
and offended, no doubt; but surely it was not my fault.

               <head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
               <head>Further Warnings</head>
               <p>The next day, I accompanied my uncle and aunt to dinner parry at Mr 
Wilmot's. He had two ladies staying with him, his niece Annabella, a 
fine dashing girl, or rather young woman, of some five and twenty, 
too great a flirt to be married, according to her own assertion, but 
greatly admired by the gentlemen, who universally pronounced her a 
splendid woman,—and her gentle cousin Milicent Hargrave, who had 
taken a violent fancy to me, mistaking me for something vastly 
better than I was. And I, in return, was very fond of her—I should 
entirely exclude poor Milicent in my general animadversions against 
the ladies of my acquaintance. But it was not on her account, or her 
cousin's, that I have mentioned the party: it was for the sake of 
another of Mr Wilmot's guests, to wit Mr Huntingdon. I have good 
reason to remember his preSence there, for this was the last time I 
saw him. 
</p>
               <p>He did not sit near me at dinner; for it was his fate to hand in a 
capacious old dowager, and mine to be handed in by Mr Grimsby, a 
friend of his, but a man I very greatly disliked: there was a 
sinister cast in his countenance, and a mixture of lurking ferocity 
and fulsome insincerity in his demeanour, that I could not away 
with. What a tiresome custom that is, by the by—one among the many 
sources of factitious annoyance of this ultra-civilized life. If the 
gentlemen <hi>must</hi> lead the ladies into the dining-room, why 
cannot they take those they like best? 
</p>
               <p>I am not sure, however, that Mr Huntingdon would have taken me, if 
he <hi>had</hi> been at liberty to make his own selection. It is quite 
possible he might have chosen Miss Wilmot; for she seemed bent upon 
engrossing his attention to herself, and he seemed nothing loath to 
pay the homage she demanded. I thought so, at least, when I saw how 
they talked and laughed, and glanced across the table, to the 
neglect and evident umbrage of their respective neighbours—and 
afterwards, as the gentlemen joined us in the drawing. room, when 
she, immediately upon his entrance, loudly called upon him to be the arbiter 
of a dispute 
between herself and another 
lady, and he answered the summons with alacrity, and decided the 
question without a moment's hesitation in her favour—though, to my 
thinking, she was obviously in the wrong—and then stood chatting 
familiarly with her and a group of other ladies; while I sat with 
Milicent Hargrave, at the opposite end of the room, looking over the 
latter's drawings and aiding her with my critical observations and 
advice, at her particular desire. But in spite of my efforts to 
remain composed, my attention wandered from the drawings to the 
merry group, and against my better judgment my wrath rose, and 
doubtless my countenance lowered; for Milicent, observing that I 
must be tired of her daubs and scratches, begged I would join the 
company now, and defer the examination of the remainder to another 
opportunity. But while I was assuring her that I had no wish to join 
them, and was not tired, Mr Huntingdon himself came up to the little 
round table at which we sat. 
</p>
               <p>`Are these yours?' said he, carelessly taking up one of the 
drawings. 
</p>
               <p>`No, they are Miss Hargrave's.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! well, let's have a look at them.' 
</p>
               <p>And, regardless of Miss Hargrave's protestations that they were not 
worth looking at, he drew a chair to my side, and receiving tile 
drawings, one by one from my hand, successively scanned them over, 
and threw them on the table, but said not a word about them, though 
he was talking all the time. I don't know what Milicent Hargrave 
thought of such conduct, but I found his conversation extremely 
interesting, though as I afterwards discovered, when I came to 
analyse it, it was chiefly confined to quizzing the different 
members of the company present; and albeit he made some clever 
remarks, and some excessively droll ones, I do not think the whole 
would appear anything very particular, if written here, without the 
adventitious aids of look, and tone, and gesture, and that ineffable 
but indefinite charm, which cast a halo over all he did and said, 
and which would have made it a delight to look in his face, and 
hear. the music of his voice, if he had been talking positive 
nonsense—and which, moreover, made me feel so bitter against my 
aunt when she put a stop to this enjoyment, by coming composedly 
forward, under pretence of wishing to see the drawings, that she 
cared and knew nothing about, and while making believe to examine 
them, addressing herself to Mr Huntingdon, with one of her coldest 
and most repellent aspects, and beginning a series of the most 
commonplace and formidably formal questions and observations, on 
purpose to wrest his attention from me—on purpose to vex me, as I 
thought: and having now looked through the portfolio, I left them to 
their tête-à-tête, and seated myself on a sofa, 
quite apart from the company—never thinking how strange such 
conduct would appear, but merely to indulge, at first, the vexation 
of the moment, and subsequently to enjoy my private thoughts. 
</p>
               <p>But I was not left long alone, for Mr Wilmot, of all men the least 
welcome, took advantage of my isolated position to come and plant 
beside me. I had flattered myself that I had so effectually repulsed 
his advances on all former occasions, that I had nothing more to 
apprehend from his unfortunate predilection; but it seems I was 
mistaken: so great was his confidence, either in his wealth or his 
remaining powers of attraction, and so firm his conviction of 
feminine weakness, that he thought himself warranted to return to 
the siege, which he did with renovated ardour, enkindled by the 
quantity of wine he had drunk—a circumstance that rendered him 
infinitely the more disgusting; but greatly as I abhorred him at 
that moment, I did not like to treat him with rudeness, as I was now 
his guest and had just been enjoying his hospitality; and I was no 
hand at a polite but determined rejection, nor would it have greatly 
availed me if I had; for he was too coarse-minded to take any 
repulse that was not as plain and positive as his own effrontery. 
The consequence was, that he waxed more fulsomely tender, and more 
repulsively warm, and I was driven to the very verge of desperation 
and about to say, I know not what, when I felt my hand, that hung 
over the arm of the sofa, suddenly taken by another and gently but 
fervently pressed. Instinctively, I guessed who it was, and on 
looking up, was less surprised than delighted, to see Mr Huntingdon 
smiling upon me. It was like turning from some purgatorial fiend to 
an angel of light, come to announce that the season of torment was 
past. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen,' said he (he frequently called me Helen, and I never 
resented the freedom), `I want you to look at this picture: Mr 
Wilmot will excuse you a moment, I'm sure.' 
</p>
               <p>I rose with alacrity. He drew my arm within his, and led me across 
the room to a splendid painting of Vandyke's that I had noticed 
before, but not sufficiently examined. After a moment of silent 
contemplation, I was beginning to comment on its beauties and 
peculiarities, when, playfully pressing the hand he still retained 
within his arm, he interrupted me with— 
</p>
               <p>`Never mind the picture, it was not for that I brought you here; it 
was to get you away from that scoundrelly old profligate yonder, who 
is looking as if he would like to challenge me for the affront.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am very much obliged to you,' said I. `This is twice you have 
delivered me from such unpleasant companionship.' 
</p>
               <p>`Don't be too thankful,' he answered: `It is not all kindness to 
you; it is partly from a feeling of spite to your tormentors that 
makes me delighted to do the old fellows a bad turn, though I don't 
think I have any great reason to dread them as rivals—Have I, 
Helen?' 
</p>
               <p>`You know I detest them both.' 
</p>
               <p>`And me?' 
</p>
               <p>`I have no reason to detest <hi>you</hi>.' 
</p>
               <p>`But what are your sentiments towards me?—Helen—Speak!—How do you 
regard me?' 
</p>
               <p>And again he pressed my hand; but I feared there was more of 
conscious power than tenderness in his demeanour, and I felt he had 
no right to extort a confession of attachment from me when he had 
made no correspondent avowal himself, and knew not what to answer. 
At last I said— 
</p>
               <p>`How do <hi>you</hi> regard <hi>me</hi>?' 
</p>
               <p>`Sweet angel, I adore you! I—' 
</p>
               <p>`Helen; I want you a moment,' said the distinct, low voice of my 
aunt, close beside us. And I left him, muttering maledictions 
against his evil angel. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, aunt, what is it? bat do you want?' said I, following her to 
the embrasure of the window. 
</p>
               <p>`I want you to join the company, when you are fit to be seen, 
returned she, severely regarding me; `but please to stay here a 
little, till that shocking colour is somewhat abated, and your eyes 
have recovered something of their natural expression. I should be 
ashamed for anyone to see you in your present state.' 
</p>
               <p>Of course, such a remark had no effect in reducing the `shocking 
colour'; on the contrary, I felt my face glow with redoubled fires, 
kindled by a complication of emotions, of which indignant, swelling 
anger was the chief. I offered no reply, however, but pushed aside 
the curtain and looked into the night—or rather, into the lamp-lit 
square. 
</p>
               <p>`Was Mr Huntingdon proposing to you, Helen?' enquired my too 
watchful relative. 
</p>
               <p>`No.' 
</p>
               <p>`What was he saying then? I heard something very like it.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't know what he would have said, if you hadn't interrupted 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>`And would you have accepted him, Helen, if he had proposed?' 
</p>
               <p>`Of course not—without consulting uncle and you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! I'm glad, my dear, you have so much prudence left. Well now,' 
she added, after a moment's pause, `you have made yourself 
conspicuous enough for one evening. The ladies are directing 
enquiring glances towards us at this moment, I see. I shall join 
them. Do you come too, when you are sufficiently composed to appear 
as usual.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am so now.' 
</p>
               <p>`Speak gently then; and don't look so malicious,' said my calm, but 
provoking aunt. `We shall return home shortly, and then,' she added, 
with solemn significance, `I have much to say to you.' 
</p>
               <p>So I went home prepared for a formidable lecture. Little was said by 
either party in the carriage during our short transit home wards; 
but when I had entered my room and thrown myself into an easy chair 
to reflect on the events of the day, my aunt followed me (hither, 
and having dismissed Rachel, who was carefully stowing away my 
ornaments, closed the door: and placing a chair beside me, or rather 
at right angles with mine, sat down. With due deference I offered 
her my more commodious seat. She declined it, and thus opened the 
conference: 
</p>
               <p>`Do you remember, Helen, our conversation the night but one before 
we left Staningley?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, aunt.' 
</p>
               <p>`And do you remember howl warned you against letting your heart be 
stolen from you by those unworthy of its possession; and fixing your 
affections where approbation did not go before, and where reason and 
judgment withheld their sanction?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but <hi>my</hi> reason—' 
</p>
               <p>`Pardon me—and do you remember assuring me that there was no 
occasion for uneasiness on your account; for you should never be 
<hi>tempted</hi> to marry a man who was deficient in sense or 
principle, however handsome or charming in other respects he might 
be, for you could not love him, you should 
hate—despise—pity—anything but love him—were not those your 
words?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but—' 
</p>
               <p>`And did you not say that your affection <hi>must</hi> be founded on 
approbation; and that unless you could approve and honour and 
respect, you could not love?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but I do approve and honour and respect—' 
</p>
               <p>`How so, my dear? is Mr Huntingdon a good man?' 
</p>
               <p>`He is a much better man than you think him.' 
</p>
               <p>`That is nothing to the purpose. Is he a <hi>good</hi> man?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes—in some respects. He has a good disposition.' 
</p>
               <p>`Is he a man of <hi>principle</hi>?' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps not, exactly; but it is only for want of thought: if he had 
someone to advise him, and remind him of what is right—' 
</p>
               <p>`He would soon learn, you think—and you yourself would willingly 
undertake to be his teacher? But, my dear, he is, I believe, full 
ten years older than you—how is it that you are so beforehand in 
moral acquirements?' 
</p>
               <p>`Thanks to you, aunt, I have been well brought up, and had good 
examples always before me, which he, most likely, has not;—and 
besides, he is of a sanguine temperament, and a gays thought less 
temper, and I am naturally inclined to reflection.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, now you have made him out to be deficient in both sense and 
principle, by your own confession—' 
</p>
               <p>`Then my sense and my principle are at his service!' 
</p>
               <p>`That sounds presumptuous, Helen! Do you think you have enough for 
both; and do you imagine your merry, thoughtless profligate would 
allow himself to be guided by a young, girl like you?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; I should not wish to guide him; but I think I might have 
influence sufficient to save him from some errors, and I should 
think my life well spent in the effort to preserve so noble a nature 
from destruction. He always listens attentively now, when I speak 
seriously to him (and I often venture to reprove his random way of 
talking), and sometimes he says that if he had me always by his side 
he should never do or say a wicked thing, and that a little daily 
talk with me would make him quite a saint. It may be partly jest and 
partly flattery, but still—' 
</p>
               <p>`But still you think it may be truth?' 
</p>
               <p>`If I do think there is any mixture of truth in it, it is not from 
confidence in my own powers, but in his natural goodness.—And you 
have no right to call him a profligate, aunt; he is nothing of the 
kind.' 
</p>
               <p>`Who told you so, my dear? bat was that story about his intrigue 
with a married lady—Lady who was it—Miss Wilmot herself was 
telling you the other day?' 
</p>
               <p>`It was false—false!' I cried. `I don't believe a word of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`You think, then, that he is a virtuous, well-conducted young 
man?' 
</p>
               <p>`I know nothing positive respecting his character. I only know that 
I have heard nothing definitive against it—nothing that could be 
proved, at least; and till people can prove their slanderous 
accusations, I will not believe them. And I know this, that if he 
has committed errors, they are only such as are common to youth, and 
such as nobody thinks anything about; for I see that everybody likes 
him, and all the mammas smile upon him, and thee daughters—and Miss 
Wilmot herself—are only too glad to attract his attention.' 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, the world <hi>may</hi> look upon such offences as venial; a 
few unprincipled mothers may be anxious to catch a young man of 
fortune without reference to his character; and thoughtless girls 
<hi>may</hi> be glad to win the smiles of so handsome a gentleman 
without seeking to penetrate beyond the surface; but you, I trusted, 
were better informed than to see with their eyes, and judge with 
their perverted judgment. I did not think <hi>you</hi> would call 
these venial errors!' 
</p>
               <p>`Nor do I, aunt; but if I hate the sins I love the sinner, and would 
do much for Ills salvation, even supposing your suspicions to be 
mainly true—which I do not and will not believe.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, my dear, ask your uncle what sort of company he keeps and if 
he is not banded with a set of loose, profligate young men, whom he 
calls his friends—his jolly companions, and whose chief delight is 
to wallow in vice, and vie with each other who can run fastest and 
farthest down the headlong road to the place prepared for the devil 
and his angels.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then I will save him from them.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`Oh, Helen, Helen! you little know the misery of uniting your 
fortunes to such a man!' 
</p>
               <p>`I have such confidence in him, aunt, notwithstanding all you say, 
that I would willingly risk my happiness for the chance of securIng 
his. I will leave better men to those who only consider their own 
advantage. If he has done amiss, I shall consider my life well spent 
in saving him from the consequences of his early errors, and 
striving to recall him to the path of virtue—God grant me 
success!' 
</p>
               <p>Here the Conversation ended, for at this juncture, my uncle's voice 
was heard from his chamber, loudly calling upon my aunt to come to 
bed. He was in a bad humour that night; for his gout was worse. It 
had been gradually increasing upon him ever since we came to town; 
and my aunt took advantage of the circumstance, next morning, to 
persuade him to return to the country immediately, without waiting 
for the close of the season. His physician supported and enforced 
her arguments; and contrary to her usual habits, she so hurried the 
preparations for removal (as much for my sake as my uncle's, I 
think), that in a very few days we departed; and I saw no more of Mr 
Huntingdon. My aunt flatters herself I shall soon forget 
him—perhaps she I have forgotten him already, for I never mention 
his name; and she may continue to think so, till we meet again,—if 
ever that should be. I wonder if it will.

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
               <head>The Miniature</head>
               <p>August 25th.—I am now quite settled down to my usual routine of 
steady occupations and quiet amusements—tolerably contented and 
cheerful, but still looking forward to spring with the hope of 
returning to town, not for its gaieties and dissipations, but for 
the chance of meeting Mr Huntingdon once again; for still he is 
always in my thoughts and in my dreams. In all my employments, 
whatever I do, or see, or hear, has an ultimate reference to him; 
whatever skill or knowledge I acquire is some day to be turned to 
his advantage or amusement; whatever new beauties in nature or art I 
discover are to be depicted to meet his eye, or stored in my memory 
to be told him at some future period. This, at least, is the hope 
that I cherish, the fancy that lights me on my lonely way. It may be 
only an ignis fatuus, after all, but it can do no harm to follow it 
with my eyes and rejoice in its lustre, as long as it does not lure 
me from the path I ought to keep; and I think it will not, for I 
have thought deeply on my aunt's advice, and I see clearly, now, the 
folly of throwing myself away on one that is unworthy of all the 
love I have to give, and incapable of responding to the best and 
deepest feelings of my inmost heart—so clearly that even if I 
should see him again, and if he should remember me and love me still 
(which, alas! is too little probable, considering how he is 
situated, and by whom surrounded), and if he should ask me to marry 
him,—I am determined not to consent until I know for certain 
whether my aunt's opinion of him or mine is nearest the truth; for 
if mine is altogether wrong, it is not he that I love; it is a 
creature of my own imagination. But I think it is not wrong—no, 
no—there is a secret something—an inward instinct that assures me 
I am right. There is essential goodness in him;—and what delight to 
unfold it! If he has wandered, what bliss to recall him! If he is 
now exposed to the baneful influence of corrupting and wicked 
companions, what glory to deliver him from them!—Oh! if I could but 
believe that Heaven has designed me for this! 
</p>
               <p>To-day is the first of September; but my uncle has ordered the 
gamekeeper to spare the partridges till the gentlemen come. `What 
gentlemen?' I asked, when I heard it—a small party he had invited 
to shoot. His friend Mr Wilmot was one, and my aunt's friend Mr 
Boarham another. This struck me as terrible news, at the moment, but 
all regret and apprehension vanished like a dream when I heard that 
Mr Huntingdon was actually to be a third! My aunt is greatly against 
his coming, of course: she earnestly endeavoured to dissuade my 
uncle from asking him; but he, laughing at her objections, told her 
it was no use talking for the mischief was already done: he had 
invited Huntingdon and his friend Lord Low borough before we left 
London, and nothing now remained but to the day for their coming. So 
he is safe, and I am sure of seeing him. I cannot express my joy—I 
find it very difficult to conceal it from my aunt; but I don't wish 
to trouble her with my feelings till I know whether I ought to 
indulge them or not. If I find it my absolute duty to suppress them, 
they shall trouble no one but myself; and if I can really feel 
myself justified in indulging this attachment, I can dare anything, 
even the anger and grief of my best friend, for its object—surely, 
I shall soon know. But they are not coming till about the middle of 
the month. 
</p>
               <p>We are to have two lady visitors also: Mr Wilmot is to bring his 
niece and her cousin Milicent. I suppose my aunt thinks the latter 
will benefit me by her society and the salutary example of her 
gentle deportment, and lowly and tractable spirit; and the former, I 
suspect, she intends as a species of counter-attraction to win Mr 
Huntingdon's attention from me. I don't thank her for this; but I 
shall be glad of Milicent's company: she is a sweet, good girl, and 
I wish I were like her—<hi>more</hi> like her, at least, than I am. 
</p>
               <p>19th. They are come. They came the day before yesterday. The 
gentlemen are all gone out to shoot, and the ladies are with my 
aunt, at work, in the drawing-room. I have retired to the library, 
for I am very unhappy, and I want to be alone. Books cannot divert 
me; so having opened my desk, I will try what may be done by 
detaining the cause of my uneasiness. This paper will serve instead 
of a confidential friend into whose ear I might pour forth the 
overflowings of my heart. It will not sympathize with my but then it 
will not laugh at them, and, if I keep it close, it Cannot tell 
again; so it is, perhaps, the best friend I could have for the 
purpose. 
</p>
               <p>First, let me speak of his arrival—how I sat at my window and 
watched for nearly two hours, before his carriage entered the park 
gates—for they all came before him,—and how deeply I was 
disappointed at every arrival, because it was not his. First came Mr 
Wilmot and the ladies. When Milicent had got into her room, I 
quitted my post a few minutes, to look in upon her and have a little 
private conversation, for she was now my intimate friend, several 
long epistles having passed between us since our parting. On 
returning to my window, I beheld another carriage at the door. Was 
it his? No; it was Mr Boarham's plain, dark chariot; and there stood 
he upon the steps, carefully superintending the dislodging of his 
various boxes and packages. What a collection! one would have 
thought he projected a visit of six months at least. A considerable 
time after, came Lord Lowborough in his barouche. Is he one of the 
profligate friends, I wonder? I should think not; for no one could 
call <hi>him</hi> a jolly companion, I'm sure,—and besides, he 
appears too sober and gentlemanly in his demeanour to merit such 
suspicions. He is a tall, thin, gloomy-looking man, apparently 
between thirty and forty, and of a somewhat sickly, card worn 
aspect. 
</p>
               <p>At last, Mr Huntingdon's light phaeton came bowling merrily up the 
lawn, I had but a transient glimpse of him, for the moment it 
stopped, he sprang out over the side on to the portico steps, and 
disappeared into the house. 
</p>
               <p>I now submitted to be dressed for dinner—a duty which Rachel had 
been urging upon me for the last twenty minutes; and when that 
important business was completed, I repaired to the drawing room 
where I found Mr and Miss Wilmot, and Milicent Hargrave already 
assembled. Shortly after, Lord Lowborough entered, and then Mr 
Boarham, who seemed quite willing to forget and forgive my former 
conduct, and to hope that a little conciliation and steady 
perseverance on his part might yet succeed in bringing me to reason. 
While I stood at the window, conversing with Milicent, he came up to 
me, and was beginning to talk in nearly his usual strain, when Mr 
Huntingdon entered the room. 
</p>
               <p>`How will he greet me, I wonder?' said my bounding heart; and 
instead of advancing to meet him, I turned to the window to hide or 
subdue my emotion. But having saluted his host and hostess, and the 
rest of the company, he came to me, ardently squeezed my hand, and 
murmured be was glad to see me once again. At that moment dinner was 
announced, my aunt desired him to take Miss Hargrave into the 
dining-room, and odious Mr Wilmot, with un speakable grimaces, 
offered his arm to me; and I was condemned to sit between himself 
and Mr Boarham. But afterwards, when we were all again assembled in 
the drawing-room, I was indemnified for so much suffering by a few 
delightful minutes of conversation with Mr Huntingdon. 
</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening, Miss Wilmot was called upon to sing 
and play for the amusement of the company, and I to exhibit my 
drawings, and, though he likes music, and she is an accomplished 
musician, I think I am right in affirming that he paid more 
attention to my drawings than to her music. 
</p>
               <p>So far, so good;—but, hearing him pronounce, <hi>sotto voce</hi>, but 
with par emphasis concerning one of the pieces, `<hi>This</hi> is 
better than all!'—I looked up, curious to see which it was, and, to 
my horror, beheld him complacently gazing at the <hi>back</hi> of the 
picture—It was his own face that I had sketched there and for 
gotten to rub out! To make matters worse, in the agony of the 
moment, I attempted to snatch it from his hand;—but he pre vented 
me, and exclaiming, `No—by George, I'll keep it!' placed it against 
his waistcoat, and buttoned his coat upon it with a de lighted 
chuckle. 
</p>
               <p>Then, drawing a candle close to his elbow, he gathered all the 
drawings to himself, as well what he had seen as the others, and 
muttering, `I must look at <hi>both</hi> sides now,' he eagerly 
commenced an examination which I watched, at fr&gt;t, with tolerable 
composure, in the confidence that his vanity would not be gratified 
by any further discoveries; for, though I must plead guilty to 
having disfigured the backs of several with abortive attempts to 
delineate that too fascinating physiognomy, I was sure that, with 
that one unfortunate exception, I had carefully obliterated all such 
witnesses of my infatuation. But the pencil frequently leaves an 
impression upon cardboard that no amount of rubbing can efface. 
Such, it seems, was the case with most of these; and I confess I 
trembled when I saw him holding them so close to the candle, and 
poring so intently over the seeming blanks; but still I trusted he 
would not be able to make out these dim traces to his own 
satisfaction. I was mistaken, however—having ended his scrutiny, 
lie quietly remarked,— 
</p>
               <p>`I perceive, the backs of young ladies' drawings, like the post 
scripts of their letters, are the most important and interesting 
part of the concern.' 
</p>
               <p>Then, leaning back in his chair, he reflected a few minutes in 
silence, complacently smiling to himself, and, while I was 
concocting some cutting speech wherewith to check his gratification, 
he rose, and passing over to where Annabella Wilmot sat vehemently 
coquetting with Lord Lowborough, seated himself on the sofa beside 
her, and attached himself to her for the rest of the evening. 
</p>
               <p>`So then!' thought I—`he despises me, because he knows I love 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>And the reflection made me so miserable I knew not what to do. 
Milicent came and began to admire my drawings and make remarks upon 
them; but I could not talk to her—I could talk to no one; and upon 
the introduction of tea, I took advantage of the open door and the 
slight diversion caused by its entrance, to slip out—for I was sure 
I could not take any—and take refuge in the library. My aunt sent 
Thomas in quest of me, to ask if I were not coming to tea; but I 
bade him say I should not take any tonight; and happily she was too 
much occupied with her guests to make any further enquiries at the 
time. 
</p>
               <p>As most of the company had travelled far that day, they retired 
early to rest; and having heard them all, as I thought, go upstairs, 
I ventured out, to get my candlestick from the drawing-room 
sideboard. But Mr Huntingdon had lingered behind the rest: he was 
just at the foot of the stairs when I opened the door; and hearing 
my step in the hall—though I could hardly hear it myself—he 
instantly turned back. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, is that you?' said he; `why did you run away from us?' 
</p>
               <p>`Good night, Mr Huntingdon,' said I, coldly, not choosing to answer 
the question. And I turned away to enter the drawing. room. 
</p>
               <p>`But you'll shake hands, won't you?' said he, placing himself in the 
doorway before me. And he seized my hand, and held it much against 
my will. 
</p>
               <p>`Let me go, Mr Huntingdon!' said I—`I want to get a candle.' 
</p>
               <p>`The candle will keep,' returned he. 
</p>
               <p>I made a desperate effort to free my hand from his grasp 
</p>
               <p>`Why are you in such a hurry to leave me, Helen?' he said, with a 
smile of the most provoking self-sufficiency—`you don't hate me, 
you know.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, I do—at this moment.' 
</p>
               <p>`Not you! It is Annabella Wilmot you hate, not me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have nothing to do with Annabella Wilmot,' said I, burning with 
indignation. 
</p>
               <p>`But <hi>I</hi> have, you know,' returned he, with peculiar emphasis, 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`That is nothing to me, sir!' I retorted. 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>Is</hi> it nothing to you, Helen?—Will you swear it?—Will you?' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`No, I won:t, Mr Huntingdon! and I <hi>will</hi> go!' cried I, not 
knowing whether to laugh or to cry, or to break out into a tempest 
of fury. 
</p>
               <p>`Go then, you vixen!' he said; but the instant he released my hand, 
he had the audacity to put his arm round my neck and kiss me. 
</p>
               <p>Trembling with anger and agitation—and I don't know what besides, I 
broke away, and got my candle and rushed upstairs to my room. He 
would not have done so but for that hateful picture! And there he 
had it still in his possession, an eternal monument to his pride and 
my humiliation! 
</p>
               <p>It was but little sleep I got that night; and in the morning I rose 
perplexed and troubled with the thought of meeting him at breakfast. 
I knew not how it was to be done; an assumption of dignified, cold 
indifference would hardly do after what he knew of my devotion—to 
his face, at least. Yet something must be done to check his 
presumption—I would not submit to be tyrannized over by those 
bright, laughing eyes. And accordingly, I received his cheerful 
morning salutation as calmly and coldly as my aunt could have 
wished, and defeated with brief answers his one or two attempts to 
draw me into conversation; while I comported myself with unusual 
cheerfulness and complaisance towards every other member of the 
party, especially Annabella Wilmot, and even her uncle and Mr 
Boarham were treated with an extra amount of civility on the 
occasion, not from any motives of coquetry, but just to show him 
that my particular coolness and reserve arose [rom no general ill 
humour or depression of spirits 
</p>
               <p>He was not, however, to be repelled by such acting as this. He did 
not talk much to me, but when he did speak, it was with a degree of 
freedom and openness—and <hi>kindliness</hi> too—that plainly seemed 
to intimate he knew his words were music to my ears; and when his 
looks met mine, it was with a smile—presumptuous it might be—but 
oh, so sweet, so bright, so genial, that I could not possibly retain 
my anger: every vestige of displeasure soon melted away beneath it, 
like morning clouds before the summer sun. 
</p>
               <p>Soon after breakfast all the gentlemen save one, with boyish 
eagerness, set out on their expedition against the hapless 
partridges; my uncle and Mr Wilmot on their shooting ponies, Mr 
Huntingdon and Lord Lowborough on their legs; the one exception 
being Mr Boarham, who, In consideration of the rain that had fallen 
during the night, thought it prudent to remain behind a little, and 
join them in a while, when the sun had dried the grass. And he 
favoured us all with a long and minute disquisition upon the evils 
and dangers attendant upon damp feet, delivered with the most 
imperturbable gravity, amid the jeers and laughter of Mr Huntingdon 
and my uncle, who, leaving the prudent sportsman to entertain the 
ladies with his medical discussions, sallied forth with their guns, 
bending their steps to the stables first, to have a look at the 
horses, and let out the dogs. 
</p>
               <p>Not desirous of sharing Mr Boarham's company for the whole of the 
morning, I betook myself to the library; and there brought forth my 
easel, and began to paint. The easel and the painting apparatus 
would serve as an excuse for abandoning the drawing room, if my aunt 
should come to complain of the desertion; and besides, I wanted to 
finish the picture. It was one I had taken great pains with, and I 
intended it to be my masterpiece, though it was somewhat 
presumptuous in the design. By the bright azure of the sky, and by 
the warm and brilliant lights, and deep, long shadows, I had 
endeavoured to convey the idea of a sunny morning. I had ventured to 
give more of the bright verdure of spring or early summer to the 
grass and foliage than is commonly attempted in painting. The scene 
represented was an open glade in a wood. A group of dark Scotch firs 
was introduced in the middle distance to relieve the prevailing 
freshness of the rest; but in the foreground were part of the 
gnarled trunk and of the spreading boughs of a large forest tree, 
whose foliage was of a brilliant golden green—not golden from 
autumnal mellowness, but from the sunshine, and the very immaturity 
of the scarce expanded leaves. Upon this bough, that stood out in 
bold relief against the sombre firs, were seated an amorous pair of 
turtle doves, whose soft sad-coloured plumage afforded a contrast of 
another nature; and beneath it, a young girl was kneeling on the 
daisy-spangled turf, with head thrown back and masses of fair hair 
falling on her shoulders, her hands clasped, lips parted, and eyes 
intently gazing upward in pleased, yet earnest contemplation of 
those feathered lovers—too deeply absorbed in each other to notice 
her. 
</p>
               <p>I had scarcely settled to my work—which, however, wanted but a few 
touches to the finishing—when the sportsmen passed the window on 
their return from the stables. It was partly open, and Mr Huntingdon 
must have seen me as he went by, for in half a minute he came back, 
and setting his gun against the wall, threw up the sash, and sprang 
in, and set himself before my picture. 
</p>
               <p>`Very pretty, i' faith!' said he, after attentively regarding it for 
a few seconds—`and a very fitting study for a young lady—Spring 
just opening into summer—morning just approaching noon—girlhood 
just ripening into womanhood—and hope just verging on fruition. 
She's a sweet creature! but why didn't you make her black hair?' 
</p>
               <p>`I thought light hair would suit her better. You see I have made her 
blue-eyed, and plump, and fair and rosy.' 
</p>
               <p>`Upon my word—a very Hebe! I should fall in love with her, if I 
hadn't the artist before me. Sweet innocent! she's thinking there 
will come a time when she will be wooed and won like that pretty 
hen-dove, by as fond and fervent a lover; and she's thinking how 
pleasant it will be, and how tender and faithful he will find 
her' 
</p>
               <p>`And perhaps,' suggested I, `how tender and faithful she shall find 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps—for there is no limit to the wild extravagance of hope's 
imaginings, at such an age.' 
</p>
               <p>`Do you call <hi>that</hi>, then, one of her wild, extravagant 
delusions?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; my heart tells me it is not. I might have thought so once, but 
now, I say, give me the girl I love, and I will swear eternal 
constancy to her and her alone, through summer and winter, through 
youth and age, and life and death! if age and death <hi>must</hi>
come.' 
</p>
               <p>He spoke this in such serious earnest that my heart bounded with 
delight; but the minute after he changed his tone, and asked, with a 
significant smile, if I had `any more portraits.' 
</p>
               <p>`No,' replied I, reddening with confusion and wrath, But my 
portfolio was on the table; he took it up, and coolly sat down to 
examine its contents. 
</p>
               <p>`Mr Huntingdon, those are my unfinished sketches,' cried I, `and I 
never let anyone see them.' 
</p>
               <p>And I placed my hand on the portfolio to wrest it from him; but he 
maintained his hold, assuring me that he `liked shed sketches of all 
things.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I hate them to be seen,' returned I. `I can't let you have it, 
indeed!' 
</p>
               <p>`Let me have its bowels then,' said he; and just as I wrenched the 
portfolio from his hand, he deftly abstracted the greater part of 
its contents, and after turning them over a moment, he cried 
out,— 
</p>
               <p>`Bless my stars, here's another!' and slipped a small oval of ivory 
paper into his waistcoat pocket—a complete miniature portrait, that 
I had sketched with such tolerable success, as to be induced to 
colour it with great pains and care. But I was determined he should 
not keep it. 
</p>
               <p>`Mr Huntingdon,' cried I, `I insist upon having that back! It is 
mine, and you have no <hi>right</hi> to take it. Give it me, 
directly—I'll never forgive you, if you don't!' 
</p>
               <p>But the more vehemently I insisted, the more he aggravated my 
distress by his insulting, gleeful laugh. At length, however, he 
restored it to me, saying— 
</p>
               <p>`Well, well, since you value it so much, I'll not deprive you of 
it.' 
</p>
               <p>To show him how I valued it, I tore it in two, and threw it into the 
fire. He was not prepared for this. His merriment suddenly ceasing, 
he stared in mute amazement at the consuming treasure; and then, 
with a careless `Humph! I'll go and shoot now,' he turned on his 
heel, and vacated the apartment by the window as he came, and 
setting on his hat with an air, took up his gun and walked away, 
whistling as he went—and leaving me not too much agitated to finish 
my picture; for I was glad, at the moment, that I had vexed him. 
</p>
               <p>When I returned to the drawing.room, I found Mr Boarham had ventured 
to follow his comrades to the field; and shortly after lunch, to 
which they did not think of returning, I volunteered to accompany 
the ladies in a walk, and show Annabella and Milicent the beauties 
of the country. We took a long ramble and reentered the park just as 
the sportsmen were returning from their expedition. Toil-spent and 
travel-stained, the main body of them crossed over the grass to 
avoid us; but Mr Huntingdon, all spattered and splashed as he was, 
and stained with the blood of his prey—to the no small offence of 
my aunt's strict sense of propriety—came out of his way to meet us, 
with cheerful smiles and words for all but me, and placing himself 
between Annabella Wilmot and myself, walked up the road and began to 
relate the various exploits and disasters of the day, in a manner 
that would have convulsed me with laughter, if I had been on good 
terms with him; but he addressed himself entirely to Annabella, and 
I, of course, left all the laughter and all the badinage to her, and 
affecting the utmost indifference to Whatever passed between them, 
walked along a few paces apart, and looking every way but theirs; 
while my aunt and Milicent went before, linked arm in arm, and 
gravely discoursing together. At length, Mr Huntingdon turned to me, 
and addressing me in a confidential whisper, said— 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, why did you burn my picture?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because I wished to destroy it,' I answered, with an asperity it is 
useless now to lament. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, very good!' was the reply; `if <hi>you</hi> don't value me, I 
must turn to somebody that will.' 
</p>
               <p>I thought it was partly in jest—a half-playful mixture of mock 
resignation and pretended indifference; but immediately he resumed 
his place beside Miss Wilmot, and from that hour to this—during all 
that evening, and all the next day, and the next, and the next, and 
all this morning (the 22nd), he has never given me one kind word or 
one pleasant look-never spoken to me, but from pure necessity—never 
glanced towards me, but with a cold, un friendly look I thought him 
quite incapable of assuming. 
</p>
               <p>My aunt observes the change, and though she has not enquired the 
cause or made any remark to me on the subject, I see it gives her 
pleasure. Miss Wilmot observes it too, and triumphantly ascribes it 
to her own superior charms and blandishments; but I am truly 
miserable—more so than I like to acknowledge to my self. Pride 
refuses to aid me. It has brought me into the scrape, and will not 
help me out of it. 
</p>
               <p>He meant no harm—it was only his joyous, playful spirit; and I, by 
my acrimonious resentment—so serious, so disproportioned to the 
offence—have so wound his feelings—so deeply offended him, that I 
fear he will never forgive me—and all for a mere jest! He thinks I 
dislike him,—and he must continue to think so. I must lose him for 
ever; and Annabella may win him, and triumph as she will. 
</p>
               <p>But it is not my loss, nor her triumph that I deplore so greatly as 
the wreck of my fond hopes for his advantage, and her un worthiness 
of his affection, and the injury he will do himself by trusting his 
happiness to her. <hi>She</hi> does not love him: she thinks only of 
herself. She cannot appreciate the good that is in him: she will 
neither see it, nor value it, nor cherish it. She will neither 
deplore his faults nor attempt their amendment, but rather aggravate 
them by her own. And I doubt whether she will not deceive him after 
all: I see she is playing double between him and Lord Lowborough, 
and while she amuses herself with the lively Huntingdon, she tries 
her utmost to enslave his moody friend; and should she succeed in 
bringing both to her feet, the fascinating commoner will have but 
little chance against the lordly peer. If he observes her artful 
by-play, it gives him no uneasiness, but rather adds new zest to his 
diversion by opposing a stimulating check to his otherwise too easy 
conquest. 
</p>
               <p>Messrs Wilmot and Boarham have severally taken occasion by his 
neglect of me to renew their advances; and if I were like Annabella 
and some others, I should take advantage of their per severance to 
endeavour to pique him into a revival of affection; but, justice and 
honesty apart, I could not <hi>bear</hi> to do it; I am annoyed enough 
by their present persecutions without encouraging them farther;—and 
even if I did, it would have precious little effect upon him. He 
sees me suffering under the con descending attentions and prosaic 
discourses of the one, and the repulsive obtrusions of the other, 
without so much as a shadow of commiseration for me, or resentment 
against my tormentors. He never could have loved me, or he would not 
have resigned me so willingly, and he would not go on talking to 
everybody else so cheerfully as he does—laughing and jesting with 
Lord Low borough and my uncle, teasing Milicent Hargrave, and 
flirting with Annabella Wilmot—as if nothing were on his mind. Oh, 
why can't I hate him? I must be infatuated, or I should scorn to 
regret him as I do! But I must rally all the powers I have 
remaining, and try to tear him from my heart. There goes the dinner 
bell—and here comes my aunt to scold me for sitting here at my desk 
all day, instead of staying with the company—I wish the company 
were—gone.

               <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
               <head>An Incident</head>
               <p>TWENTY-SECOND. Night—What have I done and what will be the end of 
it? I cannot calmly reflect upon it; I cannot sleep. I must have 
recourse to my diary again; I will commit it to paper to-night and 
see what I shall think of it tomorrow. 
</p>
               <p>I went down to dinner resolving to be cheerful and well conducted, 
and kept my resolution very creditably, considering how my head 
ached, and how internally wretched I felt—I don't know what is come 
over me of late: my very energies both mental and physical must be 
strangely impaired, or I should not have acted so weakly in many 
respects, as I have done;—but I have not been well this last day or 
two: I suppose it is with sleeping and eating so little, and 
thinking so much, and being so continually out of humour. But to 
return: I was exerting myself to sing and play for the amusement, 
and at the request, of my aunt and Milicent, before the gentlemen 
came into the drawing-room (Miss Wilmot never likes to waste her 
musical efforts on ladies' ears alone): Milicent had asked for a 
little Scotch song, and I was just in the middle of it when they 
entered. The first thing Mr Huntingdon did was to walk up to 
Annabella:— 
</p>
               <p>`Now, Miss Wilmot, won't <hi>you</hi> give us some music tonight?' 
said he. `Do now! I know you will, when I tell you that I have been 
hungering and thirsting all day, for the sound of your voice. Come! 
the piano's vacant.' 
</p>
               <p>It was; for I had quitted it immediately upon hearing his petition, 
Had I been endowed with a proper degree of self-possession, I should 
have turned to the lady myself, and cheerfully joined my entreaties 
to his; whereby I should have disappointed his expectations, if the 
affront had been purposely given, or made him sensible of the wrong, 
if it had only arisen from thoughtlessness; but I felt it too deeply 
to do anything but rise from the music-stool, and throw myself back 
on the sofa, suppressing with difficulty the audible expression of 
the bitterness I felt within. I knew Annabella's musical talents 
were superior to mine, but that was no reason why I should be 
treated as a perfect nonentity. The time and the manner of his 
asking her appeared like a gratuitous insult to me; and I could have 
wept with pure vexation. 
</p>
               <p>Meantime, she exultantly seated herself at the piano, and favoured 
him with two of his favourite songs, in such superior style that 
even I soon lost my anger in admiration, and listened with a sort of 
gloomy pleasure to the skilful modulations of her full-toned and 
powerful voice, so judiciously aided by her rounded and spirited 
touch; and while my ears drank in the sound, my eyes rested on the 
face of her principal auditor, and derived an equal or superior 
delight from the contemplation of his speaking countenance , as he 
stood beside her—that eye and brow lighted up with keen enthusiasm, 
and that sweet smile passing and appearing like gleams of sunshine 
on an April day. No wonder he should hunger and thirst to hear her 
sing. I now forgave him, from my heart, his reckless slight of me, 
and I felt ashamed at my pettish resentment of such a 
trifle—ashamed too of those bitter envious pangs that gnawed my in 
most heart, in spite of all this admiration and de light. 
</p>
               <p>`There now!' said she, playfully running her fingers over the keys, 
when she had concluded the second song. `What shall I give you 
next?' 
</p>
               <p>But in saying this, she looked back at Lord Lowborough, who was 
standing a little behind, leaning against the back of a chair—an 
attentive listener, too, experiencing, to judge by his countenance, 
much the same feelings of mingled pleasure and sadness as I did. But 
the look she gave him plainly said, `Do you choose for me now: I 
have done enough for him, and will gladly exert myself to gratify 
you'; and thus encouraged, his lordship came forward, and turning 
over the music, presently set before her a little song that I had 
noticed before, and read more than once, with an interest arising 
from the circumstance of my connecting it in my mind with the 
reigning tyrant of my thoughts. And now with my nerves already 
excited and half unstrung, I could not hear those words so sweetly 
warbled forth, without some symptoms of emotion I was not able to 
suppress, Tears rose unbidden to my eyes, and I buried my face in 
the sofa-pillow that they might flow unseen while I listened. The 
air was simple, sweet, and sad; it is still running in my head,—and 
so are the words:— 
<q>
                     <l>`Farewell to thee! but not farewell </l>
                     <l>To all my fondest thoughts of thee: </l>
                     <l>Within my heart they still shall dwell; </l>
                     <l>And they shall cheer and comfort me. </l>
                     <l/>
                     <l>Oh, beautiful, and full of grace! </l>
                     <l>If thou hadst never met mine eye, </l>
                     <l>I had not dreamed a living face </l>
                     <l>Could fancied charms so far outvie. </l>
                     <l/>
                     <l>If I may ne'er behold again </l>
                     <l>That form and face, so dear to me. </l>
                     <l>Nor hear thy voice, still would I fain </l>
                     <l>Preserve, for aye, their memory. </l>
                     <l/>
                     <l>That voice, the magic of whose tone </l>
                     <l>Can wake an echo in my breast, </l>
                     <l>Creating feelings that, alone, </l>
                     <l>Can make my tranced spirit blest. </l>
                     <l/>
                     <l>That laughing eye, whose sunny beam </l>
                     <l>My memory would not cherish less;— </l>
                     <l>And oh, that smile! whose joyous gleam </l>
                     <l>No mortal languish can express. </l>
                     <l/>
                     <l>Adieu! but let me cherish, still, </l>
                     <l>The hope with which I cannot part. </l>
                     <l>Contempt may wound, and coldness chill, </l>
                     <l>But still it lingers in my heart, </l>
                     <l/>
                     <l>And who can tell but Heaven, at last, </l>
                     <l>May answer all my thousand prayers, </l>
                     <l>And bid the future pay the past </l>
                     <l>With joy for anguish, smiles for tears?' </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When it ceased, I longed for nothing so much as to be out of the 
room. The sofa was not far from the door, but I did not dare to 
raise my head, for I knew Mr Huntingdon was standing near me, and I 
knew by the sound of his voice, as he spoke in answer to some remark 
of Lord Lowborough's, that his face was turned towards me. Perhaps a 
half suppressed sob had caught his ear, and caused him to look 
round—Heaven forbid! But, with a violent effort, I checked all 
further signs of weakness, dried my tears, and, when I thought he 
had turned away again, rose, and instantly left the apartment, 
taking refuge in my favourite resort, the library. 
</p>
               <p>There was no light there but the faint red glow of the neglected 
fire;—but I did not want a light; I only wanted to indulge my 
thoughts, unnoticed and undisturbed; and sitting down on a lob stool 
before the easy chair, I sunk my head upon its cushioned seat, and 
thought, and thought, until the tears gushed out again, and I wept 
like any child. Presently, however, the door was gently opened and 
someone entered the room. I trusted it was only a servant, and did 
not stir. The door was closed again—but I was not alone: a hand 
gently touched my shoulder, and a voice said, softly— 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, what is the matter?' 
</p>
               <p>I could not answer at the moment. 
</p>
               <p>`You must and shall tell me,' was added, more vehemently, and the 
speaker threw himself on his knees, beside me on the rug, and 
forcibly possessed himself of my hand; but I hastily caught it away, 
and replied— 
</p>
               <p>`It is nothing to you, Mr Huntingdon.' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you sure it is nothing to me?' he returned; `can you swear that 
you were not thinking of me while you wept?' 
</p>
               <p>This was unendurable. I made an effort to rise, but he was kneeling 
on my dress. 
</p>
               <p>`Tell me,' continued he—`I want to know,—because, if you were, I 
have something to say to you,—and if not, I'll go.' 
</p>
               <p>`Go then!' I cried; but, fearing he would obey too well, and never 
come again, I hastily added—`Or say what you have to say, and have 
done with it!' 
</p>
               <p>`But which?' said he—`for I shall only say it if you really were 
thinking of me. So tell me, Helen.' 
</p>
               <p>`You're excessively impertinent, Mr Huntingdon!' 
</p>
               <p>`Not at all—too pertinent, you mean—so you won't tell me?—Well, 
I'll spare your woman's pride, and, construing your silence into 
“Yes,” I'll take it for granted that I <hi>was</hi> the subject of 
your thoughts, and the cause of your affliction—' 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed, sir—' 
</p>
               <p>`If you deny it, I won't tell you my secret,' threatened he; and I 
did not interrupt him again—or even attempt to repulse him, though 
he had taken my hand once more, and half embraced me with his other 
arm—I was scarcely Conscious of it, at the time, 
</p>
               <p>`It is this,' resumed he: `that Annabella Wilmot, in comparison with 
you, is like a flaunting peony compared with a sweet, wild rosebud 
gemmed with dew—and I love you to distraction!—Now, tell me if 
that intelligence gives you any pleasure.—Silence again? That means 
“Yes”—Then let me add, that I cannot live without you, and if you 
answer, “No”, to this last question, you will drive me mad—Will you 
bestow yourself upon me?—you will!' he cried, nearly squeezing me 
to death in his arms. 
</p>
               <p>`No, no!' I exclaimed, struggling to free myself from him—`you must 
ask my uncle and aunt,' 
</p>
               <p>`They won't refuse me, if you don't.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm not so sure of that-my aunt dislikes you.' 
</p>
               <p>`But <hi>you</hi> don't, Helen—say you love me, and I'll go.' 
</p>
               <p>`I wish you <hi>would</hi> go!' I replied. 
</p>
               <p>`I will, this instant,—if you'll only say you love me.' 
</p>
               <p>`You know I do,' I answered, And again he caught me in his arms, and 
smothered me with kisses. 
</p>
               <p>At that moment, my aunt opened wide the door, and stood before us, 
candle in hand, in shocked and horrified amazement, gazing 
alternately at Mr Huntingdon and me—for we had both started up, and 
now stood wide enough asunder. But his confusion was only for a 
moment. Rallying in an instant, with the most enviable assurance, he 
began— 
</p>
               <p>`I beg ten thousand pardons, Mrs Maxwell! Don't be too severe upon 
me. I've been asking your sweet niece to take me for better, for 
worse; and she, like a good girl, informs me she cannot think of it 
without her uncle's and aunt's consent. So let me implore you not to 
condemn me to eternal wretchedness: if you favour my cause, I am 
safe; for Mr Maxwell, I am certain, can refuse you nothing.' 
</p>
               <p>`We will talk of this tomorrow, sir,' said my aunt, coldly. `It is a 
subject that demands mature and serious deliberation. At pre sent, 
you had better return to the drawing-room.' 
</p>
               <p>`But meantime,' pleaded he, `let me commend my cause to your most 
indulgent—' 
</p>
               <p>`No indulgence for you, Mr Huntingdon, must come between me and the 
consideration of my niece's happiness.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah, true! I know she is an angel, and I am a presumptuous dog to 
dream of possessing such a treasure; but, nevertheless, I would 
sooner die than relinquish her in favour of the bat man that ever 
went to heaven—and as for her happiness, I would sacrifice my body 
and soul—' 
</p>
               <p>`Body and <hi>soul</hi>, Mr Huntingdon—sacrifice your <hi>soul</hi>?' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`Well, I would lay down life—' 
</p>
               <p>`You would not be required to lay it down.' 
</p>
               <p>`I would spend it, then—devote my life—and all its powers to tile 
promotion and preservation—' 
</p>
               <p>`Another time, sir, we will talk of this—aid I should have felt 
disposed to judge more favourably of your pretensions, if you too 
had chosen another time and place, and—let me add—another 
<hi>manner</hi> for your declaration.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, you see, Mrs Maxwell,' he began— 
</p>
               <p>`Pardon me, sir,' said she, with dignity—`The company are enquiring 
for you in the other room.' And she turned to me. 
</p>
               <p>`Then <hi>you</hi> must plead for me, Helen,' said he, and at length 
withdrew. 
</p>
               <p>`You had better retire to your room, Helen,' said my aunt, gravely. 
`I will discuss this matter with you, too, to-morrow.' 
</p>
               <p>`Don't be angry, aunt,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`My dear, I am not angry,' she replied: `I am <hi>surprised</hi>. If 
it is true that you told him you could not accept his offer without 
our consent—' 
</p>
               <p>`It is true,' interrupted I. 
</p>
               <p>`Then how could you permit—' 
</p>
               <p>`I couldn't help it, aunt,' I cried, bursting into tears. They were 
lot altogether the tears of sorrow, or of fear for her displeasure, 
ut rather the outbreak of the general tumultuous excitement of ny 
feelings. But my good aunt was touched at my agitation. In a softer 
tone, she repeated her recommendation to retire, and gently kissing 
my forehead, bade me good night, and put her candle in my hand; and 
I went;—but my brain worked so, I could not think of sleeping. I 
feel calmer now that I have written all this; and I will go to bed, 
and try to win tired nature's sweet restorer.

               <head>Persistence</head>
               <p>September 24th.—In the morning I rose, light and cheerful, nay, 
intensely happy. The hovering cloud cast over me by my aunt's views, 
and by the fear of not obtaining her consent, was lost in the bright 
effulgence of my own hopes, and the too delightful consciousness of 
requited love. It was a splendid morning; and I went out to enjoy 
it, in a quiet ramble in company with my own blissful thoughts. The 
dew was on the grass, and ten thousand' gossamers were waving in the 
breeze; the happy redbreast was pouring out its little soul in song, 
and my heart overflowed with silent hymns of gratitude and praise to 
Heaven. 
</p>
               <p>But I had not wandered far before my solitude was interrupted by the 
only person that could have disturbed my musings, at that moment, 
without being looked upon as an unwelcome intruder: Mr Huntingdon 
came suddenly upon me. So unexpected was the apparition, that I 
might have thought it the creation of an over excited imagination, 
had the sense of sight alone borne witness to his presence; but 
immediately I felt his strong arm round my waist and his warm kiss 
on my cheek, while his keen and gleeful salutation, `My own Helen!' 
was ringing in my ear. 
</p>
               <p>`Not yours yet,' said I, hastily swerving aside from this too 
presumptuous greeting—`remember my guardians. You will not easily 
attain my aunt's consent. Don't you see she is prejudiced against 
you?' 
</p>
               <p>`I do, dearest; and you must tell me why, that I may best know how 
to combat her objections. I suppose she thinks I am a prodigal,' 
pursued he, observing that I was unwilling to reply, `and concludes 
that I shall have but little worldly goods wherewith to endow my 
better half? If so, you must tell her that my property is mostly 
entailed, and I cannot get rid of it. There may be a few mortgages 
on the rest—a few trifling debts and encumbrances here and there, 
but nothing to speak of; and though I acknowledge I am not so rich 
as I might be—or have been—still, I think, we could manage pretty 
comfortably on what's left. My father, you know, was something of a 
miser, and, in his latter days especially, saw no pleasure in life 
but to amass riches; and so it is no wonder that his son should make 
it his chief delight to spend them, which was accordingly the case, 
until my acquaintance with you, dear Helen, taught me other views 
and nobler aims. And the very idea of having you to care for under 
my roof would force me to moderate my expenses and live like a 
Christian—not to speak of all the prudence and virtue you would 
instil into my mind by your wise counsels and sweet, attractive 
goodness' 
</p>
               <p>`But it is not that,' said I, `it is not money my aunt thinks about. 
She knows better than to value worldly wealth above its price.' 
</p>
               <p>`What is it then?' 
</p>
               <p>`She wishes me to—to marry none but a really good man.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`What, a man of “decided piety”?—ahem!—Well, come, I'll manage 
that too! It's Sunday to-day, isn't it? I'll go to church morning, 
afternoon, and evening, and comport myself in such a godly sort that 
she shall regard me with admiration and sisterly love, as a brand 
plucked from the burning. I'll come home sighing like a furnace, and 
full of the savour and unction of dear Mr Blatant's discourse—' 
</p>
               <p>`Mr Leighton,' said I, dryly. 
</p>
               <p>`Is Mr Leighton a “sweet preacher”, Helen—a “dear, delightful, 
heavenly-minded man”?' 
</p>
               <p>`He is a <hi>good</hi> man, Mr Huntingdon. I wish I could say half as 
much for you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I forgot, you are a saint, too. I crave your pardon, 
dearest—but don't call me Mr Huntingdon, my name is Arthur.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'll call you nothing—for I'll have nothing at all to do with you, 
if you talk in that way any more. If you really mean to deceive my 
aunt as you say, you are very wicked; and if not, you are very wrong 
to jest on such a subject.' 
</p>
               <p>`I stand corrected,' said he, concluding his laugh with a sorrowful 
sigh. `Now,' resumed he, after a momentary pause, `let us talk about 
something else. And come nearer to me, Helen, and take my arm; and 
then I'll let you alone. I can't be quiet while I see you walking 
there.' 
</p>
               <p>I complied; but said we must soon return to the house. 
</p>
               <p>`No one will be down to breakfast yet, for long enough,' he 
answered. `You spoke of your guardians just now, Helen; but is not 
your father still living?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but I always look upon my uncle and aunt as my guardians, for 
they are so, in deed, though not in name, My father has entirely 
given me up to their care. I have never seen him since dear mamma 
died when I was a very little girl, and my aunt, at her request, 
offered to take charge of me, and took me away to Staningley, where 
I have remained ever since; and I don't think he would object to 
anything for me, that she thought proper to sanction.' 
</p>
               <p>`But would he sanction anything to which she thought proper to 
object?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I don't think he cares enough about me.' 
</p>
               <p>`He is very much to blame—but he doesn't know what an angel he has 
for his daughter—which all the better for me, as, if he did, he 
would not be willing to part with such a treasure.' 
</p>
               <p>`And Mr Huntingdon,' said I, `I suppose you know I am not an 
heiress?' 
</p>
               <p>He protested he had never given it a thought, and begged I would not 
disturb his present enjoyment by the mention of such uninteresting 
subjects, I was glad of this proof of disinterested affection; for 
Annabella Wilmot is the probable heiress to all her uncle's wealth, 
in addition to her late father's property, which she has already in 
possession. 
</p>
               <p>I now insisted upon retracing our steps to the house; but we walked 
slowly, and went on talking as we proceeded. I need not repeat all 
we said: let me rather refer to what passed between my aunt and me, 
after breakfast, when Mr Huntingdon called my uncle aside, no doubt 
to make his proposals, and she beckoned me into another room, where 
she once more commenced a solemn remonstrance which, however, 
entirely failed to convince me that her view of the case was 
preferable to my own. 
</p>
               <p>`You judge him uncharitably, aunt, I know,' said I. `His very 
friends are not half so bad as you represent them. There is Walter 
Hargrave, Milicent's brother, for one: he is but a little lower than 
the angels, if half she says of him is true. She is continually 
talking to me about him, and lauding his many virtues to the 
skies.' 
</p>
               <p>`You will form a very inadequate estimate of a man's character,' 
replied she, `if you judge by what a fond sister says of him. The 
worst of them generally know how to hide their misdeeds from their 
sister's eyes, and their mother's too.' 
</p>
               <p>`And there is Lord Lowborough,' continued I, `quite a decent 
man.' 
</p>
               <p>`Who told you so? Lord Lowborough is a <hi>desperate</hi> man. He has 
dissipated his fortune in gambling and other things, and is now 
seeking an heiress to retrieve it. I told Miss Wilmot so; but you're 
all alike: she haughtily answered she was very much obliged to me, 
but she believed she knew when a man was seeking her for her 
fortune, and when for herself; she flattered herself she had had 
experience enough in those matters to be justified in trusting to 
her own judgment—and as for his lordship's lack of fortune, she 
cared nothing about that, as she hoped her own would suffice for 
both; and as for his wildness, she supposed he was no worse than 
others—besides he was reformed now.—Yes, they can all play the 
hypocrite when they want to take in a fond, misguided woman!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I think he's about as good as she is,' said I. But when Mr 
Huntingdon is married, he won't have many opportunities of con 
sorting with his bachelor friends;—and the worse they are, the more 
I long to deliver him from them.' 
</p>
               <p>`To be sure, my dear; and the worse <hi>he</hi> is, I suppose, the 
more you long to deliver him from himself.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, provided he is not incorrigible—that is, the more I long to 
deliver him from his faults—to give him an opportunity of shaking 
off the adventitious evil got from contact with others worse than 
himself, and shining out in the unclouded light of his own genuine 
goodness—to do my utmost to help his better self against his worse, 
and make him what he would have been if he had not, from the 
beginning, had a bad, selfish, miserly father, who, to gratify his 
own sordid passions, restricted him in the most innocent enjoyments 
of childhood and youth, and so disgusted him with every kind of 
restraint;—and a foolish mother who indulged him to the top of his 
bent, deceiving her husband for him, and doing her utmost to 
encourage those germs of folly and vice it was her duty to 
suppress,—and then, such a set of companions as you represent his 
friends to be—' 
</p>
               <p>`Poor man!' said she, sarcastically, `his kind have greatly wronged 
him!' 
</p>
               <p>`They have!' cried I—`and they shall wrong him no more—wife shall 
undo what his mother did!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well!' said she, after a short pause. “I must say, Helen, I thought 
better of your judgment than this—and your taste too. How you can 
love such a man I cannot tell, or what pleasure you can find in his 
company: for “What fellowship hath light with darkness? or he that 
believeth with an infidel?”' 
</p>
               <p>`He is not an infidel;—and I am not light, and he is not darkness, 
his worst and only vice is thoughtlessness.' 
</p>
               <p>`And thoughtlessness,' pursued my aunt, may lead to every crime, and 
will but poorly excuse our errors in the sight of God. Mr 
Huntingdon, I suppose, is not without the common faculties of men: 
he is not so lightheaded as to be irresponsible: his Maker has 
endowed him with reason and conscience as well as the rest of us; 
the Scriptures are open to him as well as to others;—and “If he 
hear not them, neither will he hear though one rose from the dead.” 
And, remember, Helen,' continued she, solemnly, `”The wicked shall 
be turned into hell, and they that <hi>forget</hi> God”!' And suppose, 
even, that he should continue to love you, and you him, and that you 
should pass through life together with tolerable comfort,—how will 
it be in the end, when you see yourselves parted for ever: you, 
perhaps, taken into eternal bliss, and he cast into the lake that 
burneth with unquenchable fire—there for ever to—' 
</p>
               <p>`Not for ever,' I exclaimed, `”only till he has paid the uttermost 
farthing”; for “If any man's work abide not the fire, he shall 
suffer loss, yet himself shall be saved, but so as by fire,” and He 
that “is able to subdue all things to Himself, will have all men to 
be saved,” and “will in the fulness of time, gather together in one 
all things in Christ Jesus, who tasted death for every man, and in 
whom God will reconcile all things to Himself, whether they be 
things in earth or things in heaven,”' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Helen! where did you learn all this?' 
</p>
               <p>`In the Bible, aunt. I have searched it through, and found nearly 
thirty passages, all tending to support the same theory.' 
</p>
               <p>`And is <hi>that</hi> the use you make of your Bible? And did you find 
no passages tending to prove the danger and the falsity of such a 
belief?' 
</p>
               <p>`No: I found, indeed, some passages that, taken by themselves, might 
seem to contradict that opinion; but they will all bear a different 
construction to that which is commonly given, and in most the only 
difficulty is in the word which we translate “ever lasting” or 
“eternal”: I don't know the Greek, but I believe it strictly means 
“for ages,” and might signify either “endless” or “long-enduring.” 
And as for the danger of the belief, I would not publish it abroad, 
if I thought any poor wretch would be likely to presume upon it to 
his own destruction, but it is a glorious thought to cherish in 
one's own heart, and I would not part with it for all the world can 
give!' 
</p>
               <p>Here our conference ended, for it was now high time to prepare for 
church. Everyone attended the morning service, except my uncle, who 
hardly ever goes, and Mr Wilmot, who stayed at home with him to 
enjoy a quiet game of cribbage. In the afternoon Miss Wilmot and 
Lord Lowborough likewise excused themselves from attending; but Mr 
Huntingdon vouchsafed to accompany us again. Whether it was to 
ingratiate himself with my aunt I cannot tell, but, if so, he 
certainly should have behaved better. I must confess, I did not like 
his conduct during service at all. Holding his prayer-book upside 
down, or open at any place but the right, he did nothing but stare 
about him, unless he happened to catch my aunt's eye or mine, and 
then he would drop his own on his book, with a puritanical air of 
mock solemnity that would have been ludicrous, if it had not been 
too provoking. Once, during the sermon, after attentively regarding 
Mr Leighton for a few minutes, he suddenly produced his gold pencil 
case and snatched up a Bible. Perceiving that I observed the 
movement, he whispered he was going to make a note of the sermon; 
but instead of that—as I sat next him—I could not help seeing that 
he was making a caricature of the preacher, giving to the 
respectable, pious, elderly gentleman, the air and aspect of a most 
absurd old hypocrite. And yet, upon his return, he talked to my aunt 
about the sermon with a degree of modest, serious discrimination 
that tempted me to believe he had really attended and profited by 
the discourse. 
</p>
               <p>Just before dinner my uncle called me into the library for the 
discussion of a very important matter, which was dismissed in few 
words. 
</p>
               <p>`Now, Nell,' said he, `this young Huntingdon has been asking for 
you: what must I say about it? Your aunt would answer “No”—but what 
say you?' 
</p>
               <p>`I say yes, uncle,' replied I, without a moment's hesitation; for I 
had thoroughly made up my mind on the subject. 
</p>
               <p>`Very good!' cried he. `Now that's a good honest answer—wonderful 
for a girl!—Well, I'll write to your father tomorrow, He's sure to 
give his consent; so you may look on the matter as settled. You'd 
have done a deal better if you'd taken Wilmot, I can tell you; but 
that you won't believe. At your time of life, it's love that rules 
the roast: at mine, it's solid, serviceable gold. I suppose now, 
you'd never dream of looking into the state of your husband's 
finances, or troubling your head about settlements, or any thing of 
that sort?' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't think I should.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, be thankful, then, that you've wiser heads to think for you. 
I haven't had time, yet, to examine thoroughly into this young 
rascal's affairs, but I see that a great part of his father's fine 
property has been squandered away;—but still, I think there's a 
pretty fair share of it left, and a little careful nursing may make 
a handsome thing of it yet; and then we must persuade your father to 
give you a decent fortune, as he has only one besides yourself to 
care for;—and, if you behave well, who knows but what I may be 
induced to remember you in my will?' continued be, putting his 
finger to his nose, with a knowing wink. 
</p>
               <p>`Thanks uncle, for that and all your kindness,' replied I. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, and I questioned this young spark on the matter of 
settlements,' continued he; and he seemed disposed to be generous 
enough on that point—' 
</p>
               <p>`I knew he would!' said I. `But pray don't trouble your head—or 
his, or mine about that; for all I have will be his, and all he has 
will be mine; and what more could either of us require?' And I was 
about to make my exit, but he called me back. 
</p>
               <p>`Stop, stop!' cried he—`We haven't mentioned the time yet. When 
must it be? Your aunt would put it off till the Lord knows when, but 
he is anxious to be bound as soon as may be: he `won't hear of 
waiting beyond next month; and you, I guess, will be of the same 
mind, so—' 
</p>
               <p>`Not at all, uncle; on the contrary, I should like to wait till 
after Christmas, at least.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! pooh, pooh! never tell me that tale—I know better,' cried he; 
and he persisted in his incredulity. Nevertheless, it is quite true. 
I am in no hurry at all. How can I be, when I think of the momentous 
change that awaits me, and of all I have to leave? It is happiness 
enough, to know that we <hi>are</hi> to be united; and that he really 
loves me, and I may love <hi>him</hi> as devotedly, and think of him 
as often as I please. However, I insisted upon consulting my aunt 
about the <hi>time</hi> of the wedding, for I determined her counsels 
should not be utterly disregarded; and no conclusions on that 
particular are come to yet.

               <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
               <head>Opinions</head>
               <p>OCTOBER 1st—All is settled now. My father has given his con sent, 
and the time is fixed for Christmas, by a sort of compromise between 
the respective advocates for hurry and delay. Milicent Hargrave is 
to be one bridesmaid, and Annabella Wilmot the other—not that I am 
particularly fond of the latter, but she is an intimate of the 
family, and I have not another friend. 
</p>
               <p>When I told Milicent of my engagement, she rather provoked me by her 
manner of taking it. Alter staring a moment In mute surprise, she 
said— 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Helen, I suppose I ought to congratulate you—and I am glad 
to see you so happy; but I did not think you would take him; and I 
can't help feeling surprised that you should like him so much.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why so?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because you are so superior to him In every way, and there's 
something so bold—and reckless—about him—so, I don't know 
how—but I always feel a wish to get out of his way, when I see him 
approach.' 
</p>
               <p>`You are timid' Milicent, but that's no fault of his.' 
</p>
               <p>`And then his look,' continued she. `People say he's handsome, and 
of course he is, but I don't like that kind of beauty; and I wonder 
that you should.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why so, pray?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, you know, I think there's nothing noble or lofty in his 
appearance.' 
</p>
               <p>`In fact, you wonder that I can like anyone so unlike the stilted 
heroes of romance? Well! give me my flesh and blood lover, and I'll 
leave all the Sir Herberts and Valentines to you—If you can find 
them.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't want them,' said she. `I'll be satIsfied with flesh and 
blood too—only the spirit must shine through and predominate. But 
don't you think Mr Huntingdon's face is too red?' 
</p>
               <p>`No!' cried I, indignantly. `It is not red at all. There is just a 
pleasant glow—a healthy freshness in his complexion, the warm, 
pinky tint of the whole harmonizing with the deeper colour of the 
cheeks, exactly as it ought to do. I hate a man to be red and white, 
like a painted doll—or all sickly white, or smoky black, or 
cadaverous yellow!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, tastes differ—but I like pale or dark,' replied she. `But, 
to tell you the truth, Helen, I had been deluding myself with the 
hope that you would one day be my sister. I expected Walter would be 
introduced to you next season; and I thought you would like him, and 
was certain he would like you; and I flattered myself I should thus 
have the felicity of seeing the two persons I like best in the 
world—except mamma—united in one. He mayn't be exactly what you 
would call handsome, but he's far more distinguished looking, and 
nicer and better than Mr Huntingdon;—and I'm sure you would say so, 
if you knew' 
</p>
               <p>`Impossible, Milicent! You think so, because you're his sister; and, 
on that account, I'll forgive you; but nobody else should so 
disparage Arthur Huntingdon to me with impunity.' 
</p>
               <p>Miss Wilmot expressed her feelings on the subject, almost as 
openly. 
</p>
               <p>`And so, Helen,' said she, coming up to me with a smile of no 
amiable import, `you are to be Mrs Huntingdon, I suppose?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes,' replied I. `Don't you envy me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, <hi>dear</hi>, no!' she exclaimed. `I shall probably be Lady Low 
borough some day, and then you know, dear, I shall be In a capacity 
to enquire, “Don't you envy <hi>me</hi>?”' 
</p>
               <p>`Henceforth, I shall envy no one,' returned I. 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed! Are you so happy then?' said she, thoughtfully; and 
something very like a cloud of disappointment shadowed her face. 
`And does he love you—I mean, does he idolize you as much as you do 
him?' she added, fixing her eyes upon me with ill-disguised anxiety 
for the reply. 
</p>
               <p>`I don't want to be idolized,' I answered, `but I am well assured 
that he loves me more than anybody else in the world—as I do 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Exactly,' said she, with a nod. `I wish—', she paused. 
</p>
               <p>`What do you wish?' asked I, annoyed at the vindictive expression of 
her countenance, 
</p>
               <p>`I wish,' returned she, with a short laugh, `that all the attractive 
points and desirable qualifications of the two gentlemen were 
`united In one—that Lord Lowborough had Huntingdon's hand some face 
and good temper, and all his wit, and mirth, and charm, or else that 
Huntingdon had Lowborough's pedigree, and title, and delightful old 
family seat, and I had him; and you might have the other and 
welcome.' 
</p>
               <p>Thank you, dear Annabella, I am better satisfied with things as they 
are, for my own part; and for you, I wish you were as well content 
with your intended, as I am with mine,' said I; and it was true 
enough; for, though vexed at first at he, unamiable spirit, her 
frankness touched me, and the contrast between our situations was 
such, that I could well afford to pity her and wish her well. 
</p>
               <p>Mr Huntingdon's acquaintances appear to be no better pleased with 
our approaching union than mine. This morning's post brought him 
letters from several of his friends, during the perusal of which, at 
the breakfast.table, he excited the attention of the company by the 
singular variety of his grimaces. But he crushed them all into his 
pocket, with a private laugh, and said nothing till the meal was 
concluded. Then, while the company were hanging over the fire or 
loitering through the room, previous to settling to their various 
morning's avocations, he came and leant over the back of my chair, 
with his face in contact with my curls, and commencing with a quiet 
little kiss, poured forth the following complaints into my ear— 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, you witch, do you know that you've entailed upon me the 
curses of all my friends? I wrote `to them the others day, to tell 
them of my happy prospects, and now, instead of a bundle of 
congratulations, I've got a pocketful of bitter execrations and 
reproaches. There's not one kind wish for me, or one good word for 
you among them all. They say there'll be no more fun now, no more 
merry days and glorious nights—and all my fault—I am the first to 
break up the jovial band, and others, in pure despair, will follow 
my example. I was the very life and prop of the community, they do 
me the honour to say, and I have shamefully betrayed my trust—' 
</p>
               <p>`You may join them again, If you like,' said I, somewhat piqued at 
the sorrowful tone of his discourse. `I should be sorry to stand 
between any man—or body of men—and so much happiness; and perhaps 
I can manage to do without you, as well as your poor deserted 
friends,' 
</p>
               <p>`Bless you! no,' murmured he, `It's “all for love or the world well 
lost,” with me. Let them go to—where they belong, to speak 
politely, But If you saw bow they abuse me, Helen, you would love me 
all the more, for having ventured so much for your sake.' 
</p>
               <p>He pulled out Iris crumpled letters, I thought he was going to show 
them tome, and told him I did not wish to see them. 
</p>
               <p>`I'm not going to show them to you, love,' said he. `They're hardly 
fit for a lady's eyes—the most part of them. But look here. This is 
Grimsby's scrawl—only three lines, the sulky dog! He doesn't say 
much, to be sure, but his very silence implies more than all the 
others' words, and the less he says, the more he thinks—G—d—n 
him!—I beg your pardon, dearest—and this is Hargrave's missive, He 
is particularly grieved at me, because, for sooth, he had fallen in 
love with you from his sister's reports, and meant to have married 
you himself, as soon as he had sown his wild oats.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm vastly obliged to him,' observed I. 
</p>
               <p>`And so am I,' said he. `And look at this. This is 
Hattersley's—every page stuffed full of railing accusations, bitter 
curses, and lamentable complaints, ending up with swearing that 
he'll get married himself in revenge: he'll throw himself away on 
the first old maid that chooses to set her cap at him,—as If I 
cared what he did with himself.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well,' said I, `If you do give up your intimacy with these men, I 
don't think you will have much cause to regret the loss of their 
society; for it's my belief they never did you much good.' 
</p>
               <p>`Maybe not; but we'd a merry time of it, too, though mingled with 
sorrow and pain, as Lowborough knows to his cost—Ha, ha!' and while 
he was laughing at the recollection of Lowborough's troubles, my 
uncle came and clapped him on the shoulder. 
</p>
               <p>`Come, my lad!' said he. `Are you too busy making love to my niece 
to make war with the pheasants?—First of October, remember!—Sun 
shines out—rain ceased even Boarham's not afraid to venture in his 
waterproof boots; and Wilmot and I are going to beat you all. I 
declare, we old 'uns are the keenest sportsmen of the lot!' 
</p>
               <p>`I'll show you what I can do today, however,' said my companion. 
`I'll murder your birds by wholesale, just for keeping me away from 
better company than either you or them.' 
</p>
               <p>And so saying he departed; and I saw no more of him till dinner. It 
seemed a weary time: I wonder what I shall do without him. 
</p>
               <p>It is very true that the three elder gentlemen had proved them 
selves much keener sportsmen than the two younger ones; for both 
Lord Lowborough and Arthur Huntingdon have, of late, almost daily 
neglected the shooting excursions to accompany us in our various 
rides and rambles, But these merry times are fast drawing to a 
close. In less than a fortnight the party breaks up, much to my 
sorrow, for every day I enjoy it more and more—now that Messrs 
Boarham and Wilmot have ceased to tease me, and my aunt has ceased 
to lecture me, and I have ceased to be jealous of Annabella—and 
even to dislike her—and now that Mr Huntingdon is become my Arthur, 
and I may enjoy Iris society with out restraint—What shall I do 
without him, I repeat?

               <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>
               <head>Traits of Friendship</head>
               <p>OCTOBER 5th.—My cup of sweets is not unmingled: it is dashed with a 
bitterness that I cannot hide from myself, disguise it as I will. I 
may try to persuade myself that the sweetness overpowers it; I may 
call it a pleasant aromatic flavour; but, say what I will, it is 
still there, and I cannot but taste it. I cannot shut my eyes to 
Arthur's faults; and the more I love him the more they trouble me. 
His very heart, that I trusted so, is, I fear, less warm and 
generous than I thought it. At least, he gave me a specimen of his 
character to-day, that seemed to merit a harder name than 
thoughtlessness. He and Lord Lowborough were accompanying Annabella 
and me in a long, delightful ride; he was riding by my side, as 
usual, and Annabella and Lord Lowborough were a little before us, 
the latter bending towards his companion as if in tender and 
confidential discourse. 
</p>
               <p>`Those two will get the start of us, Helen, if we don't look sharp,' 
observed Huntingdon. `They'll make a match of it, as sure as can be. 
That Lowborough's fairly besotted. But he'll find himself in a fix 
when he's got her, I doubt.' 
</p>
               <p>`And she'll find <hi>her</hi>self in a fix when she's got <hi>him</hi>,' 
said I, `if what I have heard of him is true.' 
</p>
               <p>`Not a bit of it. She knows what she's about; but he, poor fool, 
deludes himself with the notion that she'll make him a good wife, 
and because she has amused him with some rodomontade about despising 
rank and wealth in matters of love and marriage, he flatters himself 
that she's devotedly attached to him; that she will not refuse him 
for his poverty, and does not court him for his rank, but loves him 
for himself alone. 
</p>
               <p>`But is not <hi>he</hi> courting <hi>her</hi> for her fortune?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, not he. That was the first attraction, certainly; but now, he 
has quite lost sight of it: it never enters his calculations, except 
merely as an essential without which, for the lady's own sake, he 
could not think of marrying her. No; he's fairly in love. He thought 
he never could be again, but he's in for it once more. He was to 
have been married before, some two or three years ago; but he lost 
his bride by losing his fortune. He got into a bad way among us in 
London: he had an unfortunate taste for gambling; and surely the 
fellow was born under an unlucky star, for he always lost thrice 
where he gained once. That's a mode of self torment I never was much 
addicted to; when I spend my money I like to enjoy the full value of 
it: I see no fun in wasting it on thieves and blacklegs; and as for 
<hi>gaining</hi> money, hitherto I have always had sufficient; it's 
time enough to be clutching for more, I think, when you begin to see 
the end of what you have. But I have sometimes frequented the 
gaminghouses just to watch the on goings of those mad votaries of 
chance—a very interesting study, I assure you, Helen, and sometimes 
very diverting: I've had many a laugh at the boobies and bedlamites. 
Lowborough was quite infatuated—not willingly, but of 
necessity,—he was always resolving to give it up, and always 
breaking his resolutions. Every venture was the `just once more': if 
he gained a little, he hoped to gain a little more next time, and if 
he lost, it would not do to leave off at that juncture; he must go 
on till he had retrieved that last misfortune, at least: bad luck 
could not last for ever; and every lucky hit was looked upon as the 
dawn of better times, till experience proved the contrary. At length 
he grew desperate, and we were daily on the look-out for a case of 
felo-de-se—no great matter, some of us whispered, as his existence 
had ceased to be an acquisition to our club. At last, however, he 
came to a check. He made a large stake which he determined should be 
the last, whether be lost or won. He had often so determined before, 
to be sure, and as often broken his determination; and so it was 
this time. He lost; and while his antagonist smilingy swept away the 
stakes, he, turning chalky white, drew back in silence and wiped his 
forehead. I was present at the time; and while he stood with folded 
arms and eyes fixed on the ground, I knew well enough what was 
passing in his mind. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it to be the last, Lowborough?' said I, stepping up to him. 
</p>
               <p>`The last but ONE,' he answered, with a grim smile; and then, 
rushing back to the table, he struck his hand upon it, and raising 
his voice high above all the confusion of jingling coins and 
muttered oaths and curses in the room, he swore a deep and solemn 
oath that, come what would, THIS trial <hi>should</hi> be the last, 
and imprecated unspeakable curses on his head, if ever he should 
shuffle a card or rattle a dicebox again. He then doubled his former 
stake, and challenged anyone present to play against him. Grimsby 
instantly presented himself. Lowborough glared fiercely at him, for 
Grimsby was almost as celebrated for his luck as he was for his 
ill-fortune. However, they fell to work. But Grimsby had much skill 
and little scruple, and whether he took advantage of the other's 
trembling, blinded eagerness to deal unfairly by him, I cannot 
undertake to say; but Lowborough lost again, and fell dead sick. 
</p>
               <p>`You'd better try once more,' said Grimsby, leaning across the 
table. And then he winked at me. 
</p>
               <p>`I've nothing to try with,” said the poor devil, with a ghastly 
smile. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Huntingdon will lend you what you want,' said the other. 
</p>
               <p>`No; you heard my oath,' answered Lowborough, turning away in quiet 
despair. And I took him by the arm and led him out. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it to be the last, Lowborough?' I asked, when I got him into the 
street. 
</p>
               <p>`The last,' he answered, somewhat against my expectation. And I took 
him home—that is, to our club—for he was as submissive as a child, 
and plied him with brandy and water till he to look rather 
brighter—rather more alive, at least. 
</p>
               <p>`Huntingdon, I'm ruined!' said he, taking the third glass from my 
hand—he had drunk the others in dead silence. 
</p>
               <p>`Not you!' said I. `You'll find a man can live without his money as 
merrily as a tortoise without its head, or a wasp without its 
body.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I'm in debt,' said he—`deep in debt! And I can never, never 
get out of it!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, what of that? many a better man than you has lived and died 
in debt, and they can't put you in prison, you know, because you're 
a peer.' And I handed him his fourth tumbler. 
</p>
               <p>`But I hate to be in debt!' he shouted. `I wasn't born for it, and I 
cannot <hi>bear</hi> it!' 
</p>
               <p>`What can't be cured must be endured,' said I, beginning to mix the 
fifth. 
</p>
               <p>`And then, I've lost my Caroline,' And he began to snivel then, for 
the brandy had softened his heart. 
</p>
               <p>`No matter,' I answered, `there are more Carolines in the world than 
one.' 
</p>
               <p>`There's only one for me,' he replied, with a dolorous sigh. `And if 
there were fifty more, who's to get them, I wonder, without 
money?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, somebody will take you for your title; and then you've your 
family estate yet; that's entailed, you know,' 
</p>
               <p>`I wish to God I could sell it to pay my debts,' he muttered. 
</p>
               <p>`And then,' said Grimsby, who had just come in, `you can <hi>try 
again</hi>, you know. I <hi>would</hi> have one more chance if I were 
you. I'd never stop here.' 
</p>
               <p>`I won't, I tell you!' shouted he. And he started up and left the 
room—walking rather unsteadily, for the liquor had got into his 
head. He was not so much used to it then, but after that, he took to 
it kindly to solace his cares. 
</p>
               <p>`He kept his oath about gambling (not a little to the surprise of us 
all), though Grimsby did his utmost to tempt him to break it: but 
how he had got hold of another habit that bothered him nearly as 
much, for he soon discovered that the demon of drink was as black as 
the demon of play, and nearly as hard to get rid of—especially as 
his kind friends did all they could to second the promptings of his 
own insatiable cravings.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then, they were demons themselves,' cried I, unable to contain my 
indignation. `And you, Mr Huntingdon, it seems, were the first to 
tempt him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, what could we do?' replied he, deprecatingly—`We meant it in 
kindness—we couldn't bear to see the poor fellow so miserable:—and 
besides, he was such a damper upon us, sitting there, silent and 
glum, when he was under the threefold influence of the loss of his 
sweetheart, the loss of his fortune, and the reaction of the last 
night's debauch; whereas, when he had something in him, if he was 
not merry himself, he was an unfailing source of merriment to us. 
Even Grimsby could chuckle over his odd Sayings: they delighted him 
far more than my merry jests or Hattersleys riotous mirth. But one 
evening, when we were sitting over our wine, after one of our club 
dinners, and had all been hearty together,—Lowborough giving us mad 
toasts, and heating our wild songs and bearing a hand in the 
applause, if he did not help us to sing them himself,—he suddenly 
relapsed into silence, sinking his head on his hand, and never 
lifting his glass to his lips;—but this was nothing new; so we let 
him alone, and went on with our jollification, till, suddenly 
raising his head, he interrupted us in the middle of a roar of 
laughter by exclaiming,— 
</p>
               <p>`Gentlemen, where is all this to end?—Will you just tell me that 
now?—Where is it all to end?' 
</p>
               <p>`In hell fire,' growled Grimsby. 
</p>
               <p>`You've hit it—I thought so!' cried he. `Well then, I'll tell you 
what'—he rose, 
</p>
               <p>`A speech, a speech!' shouted we. `Hear, hear! Lowborough's going to 
give us a speech!' 
</p>
               <p>`He waited calmly till the thunders of applause and jingling of 
glasses had ceased, and then proceeded,— 
</p>
               <p>`It`s only this, gentlemen,—that I think we'd letter go no farther. 
We'd better stop while we can,' 
</p>
               <p>`Just so!' cried Hattersley— 
</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <l>`Stop poor sinner, stop and think </l>
                     <l>Before you farther go, </l>
                     <l>No longer sport upon the brink </l>
                     <l>Of everlasting woe.' </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>`Exactly!' replied his lordship, with the utmost gravity. `And if 
you choose to visit the bottomless pit, I won't go with you—we must 
part company, for I swear I'll not move another step towards 
it!—What's this?' he said, taking up his glass of wine. 
</p>
               <p>`Taste it,' suggested I. 
</p>
               <p>`This is hell broth!' he exclaimed. `I renounce it for ever!' And he 
threw it out into the middle of the table, 
</p>
               <p>`Fill again!' said I, handing him the bottle—`and let us drink to 
your renunciation.' 
</p>
               <p>`Its rank poison,' said he, grasping the bottle by the neck, `and I 
forswear it! I've given up gambling, and I'll give up this too.' He 
was on the point of deliberately pouring the whole contents of the 
bottle on to the table, but Hargrave wrested it from him, `On you be 
the curse, then!' said he. And backing from the room, he shouted, 
`Farewell, ye tempters!' and vanished amid shouts of laughter and 
applause. 
</p>
               <p>`We expected him back among us the next day; but to our surprise, 
the place remained vacant: we saw nothing of him for a whole week; 
and we really began to think he was going to keep his word. At last, 
one evening, when we were most of us as sembled together again, he 
entered, silent and grim as a ghost, and would have quietly slipped 
into his usual seat at my elbow, but we all rose to welcome him, and 
several voices were raised to ask what he would have, and several 
hands were busy with bottle and glass to serve him; but I knew a 
smoking tumbler of brandy and water would comfort him best, and had 
nearly prepared it, when he peevishly pushed it away, saying, 
</p>
               <p>`Do let me alone Huntingdon! Do be quiet, all of you! I'm not come 
to join you: I'm only come to be with you awhile, be cause I can't 
bear my own thoughts.' And he folded his arms and leant back in his 
chair; so we let him be. But I left the glass by him; and after a 
while, Grimsby Bed my attention towards it, by a significant wink; 
and, on turning my head, I saw it was drained to the bottom. He made 
a sign to replenish, and quietly pushed up the bottle. I willingly 
complied; but Lowborough detected the pantomime, and, nettled at the 
intelligent grins that were passing between us, snatched the glass 
from my hand, dashed the contents of it in Grimsby's face, threw the 
empty tumbler at me, and then bolted from the room.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope he broke your head,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`No, love,' replied he, laughing immoderately at the recollection of 
the whole affair, `he would have done so,—and perhaps spoilt my 
face, too, but providentially, this forest of curls' (taking off his 
hat and showing his luxuriant chestnut locks) `saved my skull, and 
prevented the glass from breaking till it reached the table.' 
</p>
               <p>`After that,' he continued, `Lowborough kept aloof from us a week or 
two longer. I used to meet him occasionally in the town; and then, 
as I was too good-natured to resent his unmannerly conduct, and he 
bore no malice against me,—he was never unwilling to talk to me; on 
the contrary, he would cling to me and follow me anywhere,—but to 
the club, and the gaminghouses, and such like dangerous places of 
resort—he was so weary of his own moping, melancholy mind. At last, 
I got him to come in with me to the club, on condition that I would 
not tempt him to drink; and for some time, he continued to look in 
upon us pretty regularly of an evening,—still abstaining, with 
wonderful perseverance, from the `rank poison' he had so bravely 
forsworn. But some of our members protested against this conduct. 
They did not like to have him sitting there like a skeleton at a 
feast,6 instead of contributing his quota to the general amusement, 
casting a cloud over all, and watching, with greedy eyes, every drop 
they carried to their lips, they vowed it was not fair: and some of 
them maintained that he should either be compelled to do as others 
did or expelled from the society, and swore that, next time he 
showed himself, they would tell him as much, and, if he did not take 
the warning, proceed to active measures. However, I befriended him 
on this occasion, and recommended them to let him be for a while, 
intimating that, with a little patience on our parts, he would soon 
come round again—But, to be sure, it was rather provoking; for 
though he refused to drink like an honest Christian, it was well 
known to me, that he kept a private bottle of laudanum about him, 
which he was continually soaking at—or rather, holding off and on 
with, abstaining one day and exceeding the next, just like the 
spirits. 
</p>
               <p>`One night, however, during one of our orgies—one of our high 
festivals, I mean be glided in, like the ghost in Macbeth, and 
seated himself, as usual, a little back from the table, in the chair 
we always placed for `the spectre,' whether it chose to fill it or 
not. I saw by his face that he was suffering from the effects of an 
overdose of his insidious comforter; but nobody spoke to him, and he 
spoke to nobody. A few sidelong glances, and a whispered observation 
that `the ghost was come,' was all the notice he drew by his 
appearance, and we went on with our merry carousals as before, till 
he startled us all by suddenly drawing in his chair and leaning 
forward with his elbows on the table, and exclaiming with portentous 
solemnity,— 
</p>
               <p>`Well! it puzzles me what you can find to be so merry about. What 
you see in life I don't know—I see only the blackness of darkness 
and a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation!' 
</p>
               <p>`All the company simultaneously pushed up their glasses to him, and 
I set them before him in a semicircle, and, tenderly patting him on 
the back, bid him drink and he would soon see as bright a prospect 
as any of us; but he pushed them back, muttering,— 
</p>
               <p>`Take them away! I won't taste it, I tell you—I won't—I won't!' So 
I handed them down again to the owners; but I saw that he followed 
them with a glare of hungry regret as they de+parted. Then, he 
clasped his hands before his eyes to shut out the sight, and two 
minutes after, lifted his head again, and said, in a hoarse but 
vehement whisper,— 
</p>
               <p>`And yet I must! Huntingdon, get me a glass.!' 
</p>
               <p>`Take the bottle, man! said I, thrusting the brandy-bottle into his 
hand—but stop, I'm telling too much,' muttered the narrator, 
startled at the look I turned upon him. `But no matter,' he 
recklessly added, and thus continued his relation—`In his desperate 
eagerness, he seized the bottle and sucked away, till he suddenly 
dropped from his chair, disappearing under the table amid a tempest 
of applause. The consequence of this imprudence was something like 
an apoplectic fit, followed by a rather severe brain fever—' 
</p>
               <p>`And what did you think of <hi>yourself</hi>, sir?' said I, 
quickly. 
</p>
               <p>`Of course, I was very penitent,' he replied. `I went to see him 
once or twice—nay, twice or thrice—or, by'r Lady, some four 
times,—and when he got better, I tenderly brought him back to the 
fold.' 
</p>
               <p>`What do you mean?' 
</p>
               <p>`I mean, I restored him to the bosom of the club, and 
compassionating the feebleness of his health and extreme lowness of 
his spirits, I recommended him to `take a little wine for his 
stomachs sake,' and, when he was sufficiently re-established, to 
embrace the <hi>media-via</hi>, <hi>ni-jamais-ni-toujours</hi> plan—not 
to kill himself like a fool, and not to abstain like a ninny—in a 
word, to enjoy himself like a rational creature, and do as I 
did;—for don't think, Helen, that I'm a tippler; I'm nothing at all 
of the kind, and never was, and never shall be. I value my comfort 
far too much. I see that a man Cannot give himself up to drinking 
without being miserable one half his days and mad the 
other;—besides, I like to enjoy my life at all sides and ends, 
which cannot be done by one that suffers himself to be the slave of 
a single propensity—and moreover, drinking spoils one's good 
looks,' he concluded, with a most conceited smile that ought to have 
provoked me more than it did. 
</p>
               <p>`And did Lord Lowborough profit by your advice?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`Why, yes, in a manner. For a while, he managed very well; indeed, 
he was a model of moderation and prudence—something too much so for 
the tastes of our wild community;—but, some how, Lowborough had not 
the gift of moderation: If he stumbled a little to one side, he must 
go down before he could right himself: if he overshot the mark one 
night, the effects of it rendered him so miserable the next day that 
he must repeat the offence to mend it; and so on from day to day, 
till his clamorous conscience brought him to a stand.—And then, in 
his sober moments, he so bothered his friends with his remorse, and 
his terrors and woes, that they were obliged, in self-defence, to 
get him to drown his sorrows in wine, or any more potent beverage 
that came to hand; and when his first scruples of conscience were 
overcome, he would need no more persuading, he would often grow 
desperate, and be as great a blackguard as any of them could 
desire—but only to lament his own unutterable wickedness and 
degradation the more when the fit was over. 
</p>
               <p>`At last, one day when he and I were alone together, after pondering 
awhile in one of his gloomy, abstracted moods, with his arms folded 
and his head sunk on his breast,—he suddenly woke up, and 
vehemently grasping my arm, said,— 
</p>
               <p>`Huntingdon, this won't do! I'm resolved to have done with it.' 
</p>
               <p>`What, are you going to shoot yourself?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`No; I'm going to reform,' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, that's nothing new] You've been going to reform these twelve 
months and more.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but you wouldn't let me; and I was such a fool I couldn't live 
without you. But now I see what it is that keeps me back, and what's 
wanted to save me; and I'd compass sea and land to get it—only I'm 
afraid there's n chance.' And be sighed as if his heart would 
break. 
</p>
               <p>`What is it Lowborough?' said I, thinking be was fairly cracked at 
last, 
</p>
               <p>`A wife,' he answered; `for I can't live alone, because my own mind 
distracts me, and I can't live with you, because you take the 
devil's part against me.' 
</p>
               <p>`Who—I?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes—all of you do,—and you more than any of them, you know, But 
if I could get a wife, with fortune enough to pay off my debts and 
set me straight in the world—` 
</p>
               <p>`To be sure,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`And sweetness and goodness enough,' be continued, `to make home 
tolerable, and to reconcile me to myself,—I think I should do, yet, 
I shall never be in love again, that's certain; but perhaps that 
would be no great matter, it would enable me to choose with my eyes 
open,—and I should make a good husband in spite of it; but could 
anyone be in love with me?—that's the question—With your good 
looks and powers of fascination' (he was pleased to say), `I might 
hope; but as it is, Huntingdon, do you think anybody would take 
me—ruined and wretched as I am?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, certainly.' 
</p>
               <p>`Who?' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, any neglected old maid, fasting in despair, would be delighted 
to—` 
</p>
               <p>`No, no,' said he—`it must be somebody that I can love.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, you just said you never could be in love again!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, love is not the word,—but somebody that I can like.—I'll 
search all England through, at all events!' he cried, with a sudden 
burst of hope, or desperation. `Succeed or fall, it will be better 
than rushing headlong to destruction at that d—d club: so farewell 
to it and you, Whenever I meet you on honest ground or under a 
Christian roof, I shall be glad to see you; but never more shall you 
entice me to that devil's den!' 
</p>
               <p>`This was shameful language, but I shook hands with him, and we 
parted. He kept his word; and from that time forward, he has been a 
pattern of propriety, as far as I can tell; but, till lately, I have 
not had very much to do with him. He occasionally sought my company 
but as frequently shrunk from it, fearing lest I should wile him 
back to destruction, and I found his not very entertaining, 
especially as he sometimes attempted to awaken my conscience and 
draw me from the perdition he considered himself to have escaped; 
but when I did happen to meet him, I seldom failed to ask after the 
progress of his matrimonial efforts and re searches, and, in general 
he could give me but a poor account. The mothers were repelled by 
his empty coffers and his reputation for gambling, and the daughters 
by his cloudy brow and melancholy temper,—besides, he didn't 
understand them; he wanted the spirit and assurance to carry his 
point. 
</p>
               <p>`I left him at it when I went to the continent; and on my return, at 
the year's end, I found him still a disconsolate bachelor—though, 
certainly, looking somewhat less like an unblest exile from the tomb 
than before. The young ladies had ceased to be afraid of him, and 
were beginning to think him quite interesting; but the mammas were 
still unrelenting, It was about this time, Helen, that my good angel 
brought me into conjunction with you; and then I had eyes and ears 
for nobody else, But meantime, Lowborough became acquainted with our 
charming friend, Miss Wilmot—through intervention of his good 
angel, no doubt he would tell you, though he did not dare to fix his 
hopes on one so courted and admired, till after they were brought 
into closer contact here at Staningley, and she, in the absence of 
her other admirers, indubitably courted his notice and held out 
every encouragement to his timid advances. Then indeed, he began to 
hope for a dawn of brighter days; and if, for a while, I darkened 
his prospects by standing between him and his sun—and so, nearly 
plunged him again into the abyss of despair—it only intensified his 
ardour and strengthened his hopes when I chose to abandon the field 
in the pursuit of a brighter treasure. In a word, as I told you, he 
is fairly besotted, At first, he could dimly perceive her faults, 
and they gave him considerable uneasiness; but now his passion and 
her art together have blinded him to everything but her perfections 
and his amazing good fortune, Last night, he came to rue brimful of 
his new-found felicity: 
</p>
               <p>`Huntingdon, I am not a castaway!' said he, seizing my hand and 
squeezing it like a vice, `There is happiness in store for me 
yet—even in this life—she loves me!' 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed!' said I. `Has she told you so?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, but I can no longer doubt it. Do you not see how pointedly kind 
and affectionate she is? And she knows the utmost extent of my 
poverty, and cares nothing about it! She knows all the folly and all 
the wickedness of my former life, and is not afraid to trust me—and 
my rank and title are no allurements to her; for them, she utterly 
disregards. She is the most generous, high minded being that can be 
conceived of. She will save me, body and soul, from destruction. 
Already, she has ennobled me in my own estimation, and made me three 
times better, wiser, greater than I was, Oh! if I had but known her 
before, how much degradation and misery I should have been spared! 
But what have I done to deserve so magnificent a creature?' 
</p>
               <p>`And the cream of the jest,' continued Mr Huntingdon, laughing, `is 
that the artful minx loves nothing about him, but his title and 
pedigree, and `that delightful old family seat,' 
</p>
               <p>`How do you know?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`She told me so herself; she said, `As for the man himself, I 
thoroughly despise him; but then, I suppose, it is time to be making 
my choice, and if I waited for someone capable of eliciting my 
esteem and affection, I should have to pass my life in single 
blessedness, for I detest you all!' Ha, ha! I suspect she was wrong 
there;—but however, it is evident she has no love for <hi>him</hi>, 
poor fellow,' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you ought to tell him so.' 
</p>
               <p>`What, and spoil all her plans and prospects, poor girl? No, no; 
that would be a breach of confidence, wouldn't it, Helen? Ha, ha! 
Besides, it would break his heart.' And he laughed again. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Mr Huntingdon, I don't know what you see so amazingly 
diverting in the matter: I see nothing to laugh at.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm laughing at you, just now, Jove,' said he, redoubling his 
cachinnations, 
</p>
               <p>And leaving him to enjoy his merriment alone, I touched Ruby with 
the whip, and cantered on to rejoin our companions; for we had been 
walking our horses all this time, and were consequently along way 
behind. Arthur was soon at my side again; but not disposed to talk 
to him, I broke into a gallop. He did the same; and we did not 
slacken our pace till we came up with Miss Wilmot and Lord 
Lowborough, which was within half a mile of the park gates. I 
avoided all further conversation with him, till we came to the end 
of our ride, when I meant to jump off my horse and vanish into the 
house, before he could offer his assistance; but while I was 
disengaging my habit from the crutch, he lifted me off; and held me 
by both hands, asserting that he would not let me go till I had 
forgiven him. 
</p>
               <p>`I have nothing to forgive,' said I. You have not injured 
<hi>me</hi>.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, darling—God forbid that I should!—but you are angry, because 
it was to me that Annabella confessed her lack of esteem for her 
lover.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Arthur, it is not <hi>that</hi> that displeases me: it is the 
whole system of your conduct towards your friend; and if you wish me 
to forget it, go, now, and tell him what sort of woman it is, that 
he adores so madly, and on whom he has hung his hopes of future 
happiness.' 
</p>
               <p>`I tell you, Helen, it would break his heart—it would be the death 
of him,—besides being a scandalous trick to poor Annabella. There 
is no help for him now; he is past praying for. Besides, she may 
keep up the deception to the end of the chapter: and then he will be 
just as happy in the illusion as if it were reality; or perhaps he 
will only discover his mistake when he has ceased to love her;—and 
if not, it is much better that the truth should dawn gradually upon 
him, So now, my angel, I hope I have made out a clear case, and 
fully convinced you that I cannot make the atonement you require. 
What other requisition have you to make? Speak, and I will gladly 
obey.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have none but this,' said I, as gravely as before; `that, in 
future, you will never make a jest of the sufferings of others, and 
always use your influence with your friends for their own advantage 
against their evil propensities, instead of seconding their evil 
propensities against themselves.' 
</p>
               <p>`I will do my utmost,' said he, `to remember and perform the 
injunctions of my angel monitress,' and after kissing both my gloved 
hands, he let me go. 
</p>
               <p>When I entered my room, I was surprised to see Annabella Wilmot 
standing before my toilet-table, composedly surveying her features 
in the glass, with one hand flirting her gold-mounted whip, and the 
other holding up her long habit. 
</p>
               <p>`She certainly is a magnificent creature!' thought I, as I beheld 
that tall, finely-developed figure, and the reflection of the hand 
some face in the mirror before me, with the glossy dark hair, 
slightly and not ungracefully disordered by the breezy ride, the 
rich brown complexion glowing with exercise, and the black eyes 
sparkling with unwonted brilliance. On perceiving me, she turned 
round exclaiming, with a laugh that savoured more of malice than of 
mirth,— 
</p>
               <p>`Why Helen! what <hi>have</hi> you been doing so long?—I came to tell 
you my good fortune,' she continued, regardless of Rachel's 
presence. `Lord Lowborough has proposed, and I have been graciously 
pleased to accept him. Don't you envy me, dear?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, love,' said I—`or him either,' I mentally added. `And do you 
like him Annabella?' 
</p>
               <p>`Like him! yes, to be sure—over head and ears in love!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I hope you'll make him a good wife' 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you, my dear! And what besides do you hope?' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope you will both love each other, and both be happy.' 
</p>
               <p>`Thanks;—and I hope you will make a <hi>very</hi> good wife to Mr 
Huntingdon!' said she, with a queenly bow, and retired. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, miss! how could you say so to her?' cried Rachel. 
</p>
               <p>`Say what?' replied I. 
</p>
               <p>`Why, that you hoped she would make him a good wife—I never heard 
such a thing!' 
</p>
               <p>`Because I do hope it—or rather, I wish it—she's almost past 
hope.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well!' said she, `I'm sure I hope he'll make <hi>her</hi> a good 
husband. They tell queer things about him downstairs. They were 
saying— 
</p>
               <p>`I know, Rachel—I've heard all about him; but he's reformed now. 
And they have no business to tell tales about their masters.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, mum—or else, they <hi>have</hi> said some things about Mr 
Huntingdon too.' 
</p>
               <p>`I won't hear them, Rachel; they tell lies.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, mum,' said she, quietly, as she went on arranging my hair. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you believe them, Rachel?' I asked, after a short pause. 
</p>
               <p>`No, miss, not all, You know when a lot of servants gets together, 
they like to talk about their betters: and some, for a bit of 
swagger, likes to make it appear as though they knew more than they 
do, and to throw out hints and things, just to astonish the others. 
But I think, if I was you, Miss Helen, I'd look very well before I 
leaped. I do believe a young lady can't be too careful who she 
marries.' 
</p>
               <p>`Of course not,' said I—`but be quick, will you, Rachel? I want to 
be dressed.' 
</p>
               <p>And indeed, I was anxious to be rid of the good woman, for I was in 
such a melancholy frame I could hardly keep the tears out of my eyes 
while she dressed me. It was not for Lord Lowborough—it was not for 
Annabella—it was not for myself—it was for Arthur Huntingdon that 
they rose. 
</p>
               <p>*** 
</p>
               <p>13th. They are gone—and he is gone, We are to be parted for more 
than two months—above ten weeks! a long, long time to live and not 
to see him. But he has promised to write often, and made me promise 
to write still oftener, because he will be busy settling his 
affairs, and I shall have nothing better to do, Well, I think I 
shall always have plenty to say—But O! for the time when we shall 
be always together, and can exchange our thoughts without the 
intervention of these cold go-betweens, pen, ink, and paper! 
</p>
               <p>*** 
</p>
               <p>22nd. I have had several letters from Arthur, already. They are not 
long, but passing sweet, and just like himself—full of ardent 
affection, and playful, lively humour: but—there is always a but in 
this imperfect world—and I do wish he would sometimes be serious. I 
cannot get him to write or speak in real, solid earnest. I don't 
much mind it now; but if it be always so, what shall I do with the 
serious part of myself? 
</p>

            <div xml:id="c1.23" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
               <head>First Weeks of Matrimony</head>
               <p>Feb. 18th, 1822. Early this morning, Arthur mounted his hunter and 
set off in high glee to meet the—-hounds. He will be away all day; 
and so I will amuse myself with my neglected diary—if I can give 
that name to such an irregular composition. It is exactly four 
months since I opened it last. 
</p>
               <p>I am married now, and settled down as Mrs Huntingdon of Grass-dale 
Manor. I have had eight weeks experience of matrimony. And do I 
regret the step I have taken?—No—though I must confess, in my 
secret heart, that Arthur is not what I thought him at first, and if 
I had known him in the beginning as thoroughly as I do now, I 
probably never should have loved him, and if I had loved him first, 
and then made the discovery, I fear I should have thought it my duty 
not to have married him. To be sure, I might have known him, for 
everyone was willing enough to tell me about him, and he himself was 
do accomplished hypocrite, but I was wilfully blind, and now, 
instead of regretting that I did not discern his full character 
before I was indissolubly bound to him, I am <hi>glad</hi>; for it has 
saved me a great deal of battling with my conscience, and a great 
deal of consequent trouble and pain; and, whatever I <hi>ought</hi> to 
have done, my duty, now, is plainly to love him and to cleave to 
him; and this just tallies with my inclination. 
</p>
               <p>He is very fond of me—almost too fond. I could do with less 
caressing and more rationality: I should like to be less of a pet 
and more of a friend, if I might choose—but I won't complain of 
that: I am only afraid his affection loses in depth where it gains 
in ardour I sometimes liken it to a fire of dry twigs and branches 
compared with one of solid coal,—very bright and hot, but if it 
should burn itself out and leave nothing but ashes behind, what 
shall I do? But it won't—it <hi>shan't</hi>, I am determined—and 
surely I have power to keep it alive. So let me dismiss <hi>that</hi>
thought at once. But Arthur is selfish—I am constrained to 
acknowledge that; and, indeed, the admission gives me less pain than 
might be expected; for, since <hi>I</hi> love him so much, I can 
easily forgive him for loving himself: he likes to be pleased, and 
it is my delight to please him,—and when I regret this tendency of 
his, it is for his own sake, not for mine, 
</p>
               <p>The first instance he gave was on the occasion of our bridal tour. 
He wanted to hurry it over, for all the continental scenes were 
already familiar to him: many had lost their interest in his eyes, 
and others had never had anything to lose, The consequence was, 
that, after a flying transit through part of France and part of 
Italy, I came back nearly as ignorant as I went, having made no 
acquaintance with persons and manners, and very little with 
things,—my head swarming with a motley confusion of objects and 
scenes—some, it is true, leaving a deeper and more pleasing 
impression than others, but these embittered by the recollection 
that my emotions had not been shared by my companion, but that, on 
the contrary, when I had expressed a particular interest in anything 
that I saw or desired to see, it had been displeasing to him in as 
much as it proved that I could take delight in anything disconnected 
with himself. 
</p>
               <p>As for Paris, we only just touched at that, and he would not give me 
time to see one tenth of the beauties and interesting objects of 
Rome. He wanted to get me home, he said, to have me all to himself, 
and to see me safely installed as the mistress of Grass-dale Manor, 
just as single-minded, as naive, and piquante as I was; and, as if I 
had been some frail butterfly, he expressed himself fearful of 
rubbing the silver off my wings by bringing me into contact with 
society, especially that of Paris and Rome; and, moreover, he did 
not scruple to tell me that there were ladies in both places that 
would tear his eyes out if they happened to meet him with me. 
</p>
               <p>Of course I was vexed at all this; but still, it was less the 
disappointment to myself that annoyed me, than the disappointment 
<hi>in him</hi>, and the trouble I was at to frame excuses to my 
friends for having seen and observed so little, without imputing one 
particle of blame to my companion. But when we got home—to my new, 
delightful home—I was so happy and he was so kind that I freely 
forgave him all;—and I was beginning to think my lot too happy, and 
my husband actually too good for me, if not too good for this world, 
when, on the second Sunday after our arrival, be shocked and 
horrified me by another instance of his unreasonable exaction. We 
were walking home from the morning service—for it was a fine frosty 
day, and, as we are so near the church, I bad requested the carriage 
should not be used:— 
</p>
               <p>`Helen,' said be, with unusual gravity, `I am not quite satisfied 
with you.' 
</p>
               <p>I desired to know what was wrong. 
</p>
               <p>`But will you promise to reform, if I tell you?' 
</p>
               <p>Yes, if I can—and without offending a higher authority.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! there it is, you see—you don't love me with all your 
heart.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't understand you, Arthur (at least, I hope I don't): pray 
tell me what I have done or said amiss?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is nothing you have done or said; it is something that you 
<hi>are</hi>: you are too religious. Now I like a woman to be 
religious, and I think your piety one of your greatest charms, but 
then, like all other good things, it may be carried too far. To my 
thinking, a woman's religion ought not to lessen her devotion to her 
earthly lord. She should have enough to purify and etherialize her 
soul, but not enough to refine away her heart, and raise her above 
all human sympathies.' 
</p>
               <p>`And am I above all human sympathies?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`No, darling; but you are making more progress towards that saintly 
condition than I like; for, all these two hours, I have been 
thinking of you and wanting to catch your eye, and you were so 
absorbed in your devotions that you had not even a glance to spare 
for me—I declare, it is enough to make one jealous of one's 
Maker—which is very wrong, you know; so don't excite such wicked 
passions again, for my soul's sake.' 
</p>
               <p>`I will give my whole heart and soul to my Maker if I can,' I 
answered, `and not one atom more of it to you than he allows. What 
are <hi>you</hi>, sir, that you should set yourself up as a god, and 
presume to dispute con of my heart with Him to whom I owe all I have 
and all I am, every blessing I ever did or ever can enjoy yourself 
among the rest—if you <hi>are</hi> a blessing, which I am half 
included to doubt.' 
</p>
               <p>`Don't be so hard upon me, Helen; and don't pinch my arm so, you're 
squeezing your fingers into the bone.' 
</p>
               <p>`Arthur,' continued I, relaxing my hold of his arm, `you don't love 
me half as much as I do you; and yet, if you loved me far less than 
you do, I would not complain, provided you loved your Maker more. I 
should <hi>rejoice</hi> to see you, at any time, so deeply absorbed in 
your devotions that you had not a single thought to spare for me. 
But, indeed, I should lose nothing by the change, for the more you 
loved your God the more deep and pure and true would be your love to 
me.' 
</p>
               <p>At this he only laughed, and kissed my hand, calling me a sweet 
enthusiast. Then taking off his hat, he added— 
</p>
               <p>`But look here, Helen—what can a man do with such a head as 
this?' 
</p>
               <p>The head looked right enough, but when he placed my hand on the top 
of it, it sunk in a bed of curls, rather alarmingly low, especially 
in the middle. 
</p>
               <p>`You see I was not made to be a saint,' said he, laughing. `If God 
meant me to be religious, why didn't He give me a proper organ of 
veneration?' 
</p>
               <p>`You are like the servant,' I replied, `who instead of employing his 
one talent in his master's service, restored it to him unimproved, 
alleging, as an excuse, that he knew him “to be a hard man, reaping 
where he had not sown and gathering where he had not strawed.” Of 
him, to whom less is given, less will be required; but our utmost 
exertions are required of us all. You are not with out the capacity 
of veneration, and faith and hope, and con science and reason, and 
every other requisite to a Christian's character, if you choose to 
employ them; but all our talents in crease in the using, and every 
faculty, both good and bad, strengthens by exercise; therefore, if 
you choose to use the bad—or those which tend to evil till they 
become your masters—and neglect the good till they dwindle away, 
you have only yourself to blame. But you <hi>have</hi> talents, 
Arthur—natural endowments, both of heart and mind, and temper such 
as many a better Christian would be glad to possess—if you would 
only employ them in God's service, I should never expect to see you 
a devotee, but it is quite possible to be a good Christian without 
ceasing to be a happy, merry-hearted man.' 
</p>
               <p>`You speak like an oracle, Helen, and all you say is indisputably 
true; but listen here: I am hungry, and I see before me a good 
substantial dinner: I am told that, if I abstain from this today, I 
shall have a sumptuous feast to-morrow, consisting of all manner of 
dainties and delicacies Now in the first place, I should be loath to 
wait till to-morrow, when I have the means of appeasing my hunger 
already before me; in the second place, the solid viands of tray are 
more to my taste than the dainties that are promised me; in the 
third place, I don't <hi>see</hi> to-morrow's banquet, and how can I 
tell that it is not all a fable, got up by the greasy-faced fellow 
that is advising me to abstain, in order that he may have all the 
good victuals to himself? in the fourth place, this table must be 
spread for somebody, and, as Solomon says, “Who can eat, or who else 
can hasten hereunto more than I?” and finally, with your leave, I'll 
sit down and satisfy my cravings to-day, and leave to-morrow to 
shift for itself—who knows but what I may secure both this and 
that?' 
</p>
               <p>`But you are not required to abstain from the substantial dinner of 
to-day; you are only advised to partake of these coarser viands in 
such moderation as not to incapacitate you from enjoying the choicer 
banquet of to-morrow. If, regardless of that counsel, you choose to 
make a beast of yourself now, and overeat and overdrink yourself 
till you turn the good victuals into poison, who is to blame if, 
hereafter, while you are suffering the torments of yesterday's 
gluttony and drunkenness, you see more temperate men sitting down to 
enjoy themselves at that splendid entertainment which you are unable 
to taste?' 
</p>
               <p>`Most true, my patron saint; but again, our friend Solomon 
says,—“There is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink, 
and to be merry.”' 
</p>
               <p>`And again,' returned I, `he says, “Rejoice, O young man, in thy 
youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the right of thine 
eyes; but know thou that, for all these things, God will bring thee 
into judgment.”' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but Helen, I'm sure I've been very good these last few weeks. 
bat have you seen amiss in me? and what would you have me to do?' 
</p>
               <p>`Nothing—more than you do, Arthur: your actions are all right, so 
far; but I would have your thoughts changed; I would have you to 
fortify yourself against temptation, and not to call evil good, and 
good, evil; I should wish you to think more deeply, to look farther, 
and aim higher than you do.' 
</p>
               <p>We now stood before our own door, and I said no more; but, with an 
ardent and tearful embrace, I left him, and went into the house, and 
upstairs to take off my bonnet and mantle. I wished to say nothing 
more on that subject at the time, lest I should disgust him with 
both it and me.

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV</head>
               <head>First Quarrel</head>
               <p>March 25th.—Arthur is getting tired—not of me, I trust, but of the 
idle, quiet life he leads—and no wonder, for he has so few sources 
of amusement; he never reads anything but newspapers and sporting 
magazines; and when he sees me occupied with a book, he won't let me 
rest till I close it. In fine weather he generally manages to get 
through the time pretty well; but on rainy days, of which we have 
had a good many of late, it is quite painful to witness his ennui. I 
do all can to amuse him, but it is impossible to get him to feel 
interested what I most like to talk about; while, on the other hand, 
he likes to talk about things that cannot interest me—or even that 
annoy me—and these please him the most of all; for his favourite 
amusement is to sit or loll beside me on the sofa and tell me 
stories of his former amours, always turning upon the ruin of some 
confiding girl or the cozening of some unsuspecting husband; and 
when I express my horror and indignation, he lays it all to the 
charge of jealousy, and laughs till the tears run down his cheeks. I 
used to fly into passions or melt into tears at first, but seeing 
that his delight increased in proportion to my anger and agitation, 
I have since endeavoured to suppress my feelings and receive his 
revelations in the silence of calm contempt; but still, he reads the 
inward struggle in my face, and misconstrues my bitterness of soul 
for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded jealousy; and when he 
has sufficiently diverted himself with that, or fears my displeasure 
will become too serious for his comfort, be tries to kiss and soothe 
me into smiles again—never were his caresses so little welcome as 
then! <hi>This is double</hi> selfishness, displayed to me and to the 
victims of his former love. There are times when, with a momentary 
pang—a flash of wild dismay, I ask myself, `Helen, what have you 
done?' But I rebuke the inward questioner, and repel the obtrusive 
thoughts that crowd upon me; for, were he ten times as sensual and 
impenetrable to good and lofty thoughts, I well know I have Do right 
to complain. And I don't and won't complain. I do and will love him 
still; and I do not and will not regret that I have linked my fate 
with his. 
</p>
               <p>April 4th.—We have had a downright quarrel. `The particulars are as 
follows:—Arthur had told me, at different intervals, the whole 
story of his intrigue with Lady F—, which I would not believe 
before. It was some consolation, however, to find that, in this 
instance, the lady had been more to blame than he; for he was very 
young at the time, and she had decidedly made the first advances, if 
what he said was true. I hated her for it, for it seemed as if she 
had chiefly contributed to his corruption, and when he was beginning 
to talk about her the other day, I begged he would not mention her, 
for I detested the very sound of her name,— 
</p>
               <p>`Not because you loved her, Arthur, mind, but because she injured 
you, and deceived her husband, and was altogether a very abominable 
woman, whom you ought to be ashamed to mention.' 
</p>
               <p>But he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband, 
whom it was impossible to love. 
</p>
               <p>`Then why did she marry him?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`For his money,' was the reply. 
</p>
               <p>`Then that was another crime, and her solemn promise to love and 
honour him was another, that only increased the enormity of the 
last.' 
</p>
               <p>`You are too severe upon the poor lady,' laughed he. `But never 
mind, Helen, I don't care for her now; and I never loved any of them 
half as much as I do you; so you needn't fear to be forsaken like 
them.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you had told me these things before, Arthur, I never should have 
given you the chance.' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>Wouldn't</hi> you, my darling!' 
</p>
               <p>`Most certainly not!' 
</p>
               <p>He laughed incredulously. 
</p>
               <p>`I wish I could convince you of it now!' cried I, starting up from 
beside him; and for the first time in my life, and I hope the last, 
I wished I had not married him. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen,' said he, more gravely, `do you know that if I believed you 
now, I should be very angry?—but thank Heaven I don't. Though you 
stand there with your white face and flashing eyes, looking at me 
like a very tigress, I know the heart within you, perhaps a trifle 
better than you know it yourself.' 
</p>
               <p>Without another word, I left the room, and locked myself up in my 
own chamber. In about half an hour, he came to the door; and first 
he tried the handle, then he knocked. 
</p>
               <p>`Won't you let me in, Helen?' said he. 
</p>
               <p>`No; you have displeased me,' I replied, `and I don't want to see 
your face or hear your voice again till the morning.' 
</p>
               <p>He paused a moment, as if dumbfoundered or uncertain how to answer 
such a speech, and then turned and walked away. This was only an 
hour after dinner: I knew he would find it very dull to sit alone 
all the evening; and this considerably softened my resentment, 
though it did not make me relent. I was determined to show him that 
my heart was not his slave, and I could live without him if I chose; 
and I sat down and wrote a long letter to my aunt—of course telling 
her nothing of all this. Soon after ten o'clock, I heard him come up 
again; but he passed my door and went straight to his own 
dressing-room, where he shut himself in for the fight. 
</p>
               <p>I was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning, and 
not a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room 
with a careless smile. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you cross still, Helen?' said he, approaching as if to salute 
me. I coldly turned to the table, and began to pour out the coffee, 
observing that he was rather late. 
</p>
               <p>He uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window, where he 
stood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of 
sullen, grey clouds, streaming rain, soaking lawn, and dripping, 
leafless trees—and muttering execrations on the weather, and then 
sat down to breakfast. ~e taking his coffee, he muttered it was 
`d—d cold.' 
</p>
               <p>`You should not have left it so long,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>He made Do answer, and the meal was concluded in silence. It was a 
relief to both when the letter-bag was brought in. It contained, 
upon examination, a newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a 
couple of letters for me, which he tossed across the table without a 
remark. One was from my brother, the other from Milicent Hargrave, 
who is now in London with her mother. His, I think, were business 
letters, and apparently not much to his mind, for he crushed them 
into his pocket with some muttered expletives, that I should have 
reproved him for at any other time. The paper, he set before him, 
and pretended to be deeply absorbed in its contents during the 
remainder of breakfast, and a considerable time after. 
</p>
               <p>The reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of 
household concerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning; 
after lunch, I got my drawing, and from dinner till bedtime, I read. 
Meanwhile, poor Arthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse 
him or to occupy his time. He wanted to appear as busy and as 
unconcerned as I did: had the weather at all permitted, he would 
doubtless have ordered his horse and set off to some distant 
region—no matter where—immediately after breakfast, and not 
returned till night; had there been a lady anywhere within reach, of 
any age between fifteen and forty-five, he would have sought revenge 
and found employment in getting up—or trying to get up—a desperate 
flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction, entirely 
cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings were 
truly deplorable. Ben he had done yawning over his paper and 
scribbling short answers to his shorter letters, he spent the 
remainder of the morning and the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting 
about from room to room, watching the clouds, cursing the rain, 
alternately petting, and teasing, and abusing his dogs, sometimes 
lounging on the sofa with a book that he could not force himself to 
read, and very often fixedly gazing at me, when he thought I did not 
perceive it, with the vain hope of detecting some traces of tears, 
or some tokens of remorseful anguish in my face. But I managed to 
preserve an undisturbed, though grave serenity throughout the day. I 
was not really angry: I felt for him all the time, and longed to be 
reconciled; but I determined he should make the first advances, or 
at least show some signs of an humble and contrite spirit, first; 
for, if I began, it would only minister to his self-conceit, 
increase his arrogance, and quite destroy the lesson I wanted to 
give him. 
</p>
               <p>He made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear, 
took an unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his 
tongue; for when he came in and found me quietly occupied with my 
book, too busy to lift my head on his entrance, he merely murmured 
an expression of suppressed disapprobation, and, shutting the door 
with a bang, went and stretched himself at full length on the sofa, 
and composed himself to sleep. But his favourite cocker, Dash, that 
had been lying at my feet, took the liberty of jumping upon him and 
beginning to lick his face. He struck it off with a smart blow; and 
the poor dog squeaked, and ran cowering back to me. den he woke up, 
about half an hour after, he called it to him again; but Dash only 
looked sheepish and wagged the tip of his tail. He called again, 
more sharply, but Dash only clung the closer to me, and licked my 
hand as if imploring protection. Enraged at this, his master 
snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head. The poor dog set 
up a piteous outcry and ran to the door. I let him out, and then 
quietly took up the book. 
</p>
               <p>`Give that book to me,' said Arthur,in very courteous tone. I gave 
it to him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why did you let the dog out?' he asked. `You knew I wanted him.' 
</p>
               <p>`By what token?' I replied; `by your throwing the book at him? but 
perhaps it was intended for me?' 
</p>
               <p>`No—but I see you've got a taste of it,' said he, looking at my 
hand, that had also been struck, and was rather severely grazed. 
</p>
               <p>I returned to my reading; and he endeavoured to occupy himself in 
the same manner; but, in a little while, after several portentous 
yawns, he pronounced <hi>his</hi> book to be `cursed trash,' and threw 
it on to the table. Then followed eight or ten minutes of silence, 
during the greater part of which, I believe, he was staring at me. 
At last his patience was tired out. 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>is</hi> that book, Helen?' he exclaimed. 
</p>
               <p>I told him. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it interesting?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, very.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humph!' 
</p>
               <p>I went on reading—or pretending to read, at least—I cannot say 
there was much communication between my eyes and my brain; for, 
while the former ran over the pages, the latter was earnestly 
wondering when Arthur would speak next, and what he would say, and 
what I should answer. But he did not speak again till I rose to make 
the tea, and then it was only to say he should not take any. He 
continued lounging on the sofa. and alternately closing his eyes and 
looking at his watch and at me, till bedtime, when I rose, and took 
my candle and retired. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen!' cried he, the moment I had left the room. I turned back, 
and stood awaiting his commands. 
</p>
               <p>`What do you want, Arthur?' I said, at length. 
</p>
               <p>`Nothing,' replied he. `Go!' 
</p>
               <p>I went, but hearing him mutter something as I was closing the door, 
I turned again. It sounded very like `confounded slut,' but I was 
quite willing it should be something else. 
</p>
               <p>`Were you speaking, Arthur?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`No,' was the answer; and I shut the doom and departed. I saw 
nothing more of him till the following morning at breakfast, when he 
came down a full hour after the usual time. 
</p>
               <p>`You're very late,' was my morning's salutation. 
</p>
               <p>`You needn't have waited for me,' was his; and he walked up to the 
window again. It was just such weather as yesterday. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, this confounded rain!' he muttered. But after studiously 
regarding it for a minute or two, a bright idea seemed to strike 
him, for he suddenly exclaimed, `But I know what I'll do!' and then 
returned and took his seat at the table. The letter.bag was already 
there, waiting to be opened. He unlocked it and examined the 
contents, but said nothing about them. 
</p>
               <p>`Is,there anything for me?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`No.' He opened the newspaper and began to read. 
</p>
               <p>`You'd better take your coffee,' suggested I; `it will be cold 
again.' 
</p>
               <p>`You may go,' said he, `if you've done. I don't want you.' 
</p>
               <p>I rose, and withdrew to the next room, wondering if we were to have 
another such miserable day as yesterday, and wishing intensely for 
an end of these mutually inflicted torments. Shortly after, I heard 
him ring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that 
sounded as if he meditated a long journey. He then sent for the 
coachman, and I heard something about the carriage and the horses, 
and London, and seven o'clock to-morrow morning, that startled and 
disturbed me not a little. 
</p>
               <p>`I must not let him go to London, whatever comes of it,' said I to 
myself: `he will run into all kinds of mischief, and I shall be the 
cause of it. But the question is, how am I to alter his 
purpose?—Well, I will wait awhile, and see if he mentions it.' 
</p>
               <p>I waited most anxiously, from hour to hour; but not a word was 
spoken, on that or any other subject, to me. He whistled, and talked 
to his dogs, and wandered from room to room, much the same as on the 
previous day. At last I began to think I must introduce the subject 
myself, and was pondering how to bring it about, when John 
unwittingly came to my relief with the following message from the 
coachman:— 
</p>
               <p>`Please, sir, Richard save one of the horses has got a very bad 
cold, and he thinks, sir, if you could make it convenient to go the 
day after to-morrow, instead of to-morrow, he could physic it today 
so as—' 
</p>
               <p>`Confound his impudence!' interjected the master. 
</p>
               <p>`Please, sir, he says it would be a deal better if you could,' 
persisted John, `for he hopes there'll be a change in the weather 
shortly, and he says it's not <hi>likely</hi>, when a horse is so bad 
with a cold, and physicked and all—' 
</p>
               <p>`Devil take the horse!' cried the gentleman—`Well, tell him I'll 
think about it,' he added, after a moment's reflection. He cast a 
searching glance at me, as the servant withdrew, expecting to see e 
token of deep astonishment and alarm; but, being previously 
prepared, I preserved an aspect of stoical indifference. His 
countenance fell as he met my steady gaze, and he turned away in 
very obvious disappointment, and walked up to the fireplace, where 
he stood in an attitude of undisguised dejection, leaning against 
the chimney-piece with his forehead sunk upon his arm. 
</p>
               <p>`Where do you want to go, Arthur?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`To London,' replied he, gravely. 
</p>
               <p>`What for?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`Because I cannot be happy here.' 
</p>
               <p>`Why not?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because my wife doesn't love me.' 
</p>
               <p>`She would love you with all her heart, if you deserved it.' 
</p>
               <p>`What must I do to deserve it?' 
</p>
               <p>This seemed humble and earnest enough; and I was so much affected, 
between sorrow and joy, that I was obliged to pause a few seconds 
before I could steady my voice to reply. 
</p>
               <p>`if she gives you her heart,' said I, `you must take it thankfully, 
and use it well, and not pull it in pieces, and laugh in her face, 
because she cannot snatch it away.' 
</p>
               <p>He now turned round and stood faring me, with his back to the 
fire. 
</p>
               <p>`Come then, Helen, are you going to be a good girl?' said he. 
</p>
               <p>This sounded rather too arrogant, and the smile that accompanied it 
did not please me. I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former 
answer had implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might 
have seen me brush away a tear. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you going to forgive me, Helen?' he resumed, more humbly. 
</p>
               <p>`Are <hi>you</hi> penitent?' I replied, stepping up to him and smiling 
in his face. 
</p>
               <p>`Heart-broken!' he answered, with a rueful countenance—yet with a 
merry smile just lurking within his eyes and about the corners of 
his mouth; but this could not repulse me, and I flew into his arms. 
He fervently embraced me and though I shed a torrent of tears, I 
think I never was happier in my life than at that moment. 
</p>
               <p>`Then you won't go to London, Arthur?' I said, when the first 
transport of tears and kisses had subsided. 
</p>
               <p>`No, love,—unless you will go with me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I will, gladly,' I answered, `if you think the change will amuse 
you, and if you will put off the journey till next week.' 
</p>
               <p>He readily consented, but said there was no need of much 
preparation, as he should not be staying for long, for he did not 
wish me to be Londonized, and to lose my country freshness and 
originality by too much intercourse with the ladies of the world. I 
thought this folly; but I did not wish to contradict him now: I 
merely said that I was of very domestic habits, as he well knew, and 
had no particular wish to mingle with the world. 
</p>
               <p>So we are to go to London on Monday, the day after to-morrow. It is 
now four days since the termination of our quarrel, and I'm sure it 
has done us both good: it has made me like Arthur a great deal 
better and made him behave a great deal better to me. He has never 
once attempted to annoy me, since, by the most distant allusion to 
Lady F—or any of those disagreeable reminiscences of his former 
life—I wish I could blot them from my memory, or else get him to 
regard such matters in the same light as I do. Well! it is 
something, however, to have made him see that they are not fit 
subjects for a conjugal jest. He may see farther sometime—I will 
put no limits to my hopes; and, in spite of my aunt's forebodings 
and my own unspoken fears, I trust we shall be happy yet.

               <head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
               <head>First Absence</head>
               <p>ON the eighth of April, we went to London; on the eighth of May, I 
returned, in obedience to Arthur's wish: very much against my own, 
because I left him behind. If he had come with me, I should have 
been very glad to get home again, for he led me such a round of 
restless dissipation, while there, that, in that short space of 
time, I was quite tired out. He seemed bent upon displaying me to 
his friends and acquaintances in particular, and the public in 
general, on every possible occasion and to the greatest possible 
advantage. It was something to feel that he considered me a worthy 
object of pride; but I paid dear for the gratification, for in the 
first place, to please him, I had to violate my cherished 
predilections—my almost rooted principles in favour of a plain, 
dark, sober style of dress; I must sparkle in costly jewels and deck 
myself out like a painted butterfly, just as I had, long since, 
determined I would never do—and this was nothing sacrifice; in the 
second place, I was continually straining to satisfy his sanguine 
expectations and do honour to his choice, by my general conduct and 
deportment, and fearing to disappoint him by some awkward 
misdemeanour, or some trait of inexperienced ignorance about the 
customs of society, especially when I acted the part of hostess, 
which I was not unfrequently called upon to do; and in the third 
place, as I intimated before, I was wearied of the throng and 
bustle, the restless hurry and ceaseless change of life so alien to 
all my previous habits. At last, he suddenly discovered that the 
London air did not agree with me, and I was languishing for my 
country home and must immediately return to Grass-dale. 
</p>
               <p>I laughingly assured him that the case was not so urgent as he 
appeared to think it, but I was quite willing to go home if he was. 
He replied that he should be obliged to remain a week or two longer, 
as he had business that required his presence. 
</p>
               <p>`Then I will stay with you,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`But I can't do with you, Helen,' was his answer: `as long as you 
stay, I shall attend to you and neglect my business.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I won't let you,' I returned: `now that I know you have 
business to attend to, I shall insist upon your attending to it, and 
letting me alone—and, to tell you the truth, I shall be glad of a 
little rest. I can take my rides and walks in the parkas usual; and 
your business cannot occupy all your time; I shall see you at 
mealtimes and in the evenings, at least, and that will be better 
than being leagues away and never seeing you at all.' 
</p>
               <p>`But my love, I cannot let you stay. How can I settle my affairs 
when I know that you are here, neglected—' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall not feel myself neglected: while you are doing your duty, 
Arthur, I shall never complain of neglect. If you had told me, 
before, that you had anything to do, it would have been half done 
before this; and now you must make up for lost time by redoubled 
exertions. Tell me what it is; and I will be your task master, 
instead of being a hindrance.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no,' persisted the impracticable creature; `you must go home, 
Helen; I must have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe and 
well, though far away. Don't I see that you are looking quite 
rakish?—Your bright eyes are faded, and that tender, delicate bloom 
has quite deserted your cheek' 
</p>
               <p>`That is only with too much gaiety and fatigue.' 
</p>
               <p>`It is not, I tell you; it is the London air: you are pining for the 
fresh breezes of your country home—and you shall feel them, before 
you are two days older. And remember your situation, dear est Helen; 
on your health, you know, depends the health, if not the life, of 
our future hope.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you really wish to get rid of me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Positively, I do; and I will take you down myself to Grass-dale, 
and then return. I shall not be absent above a week—or fortnight at 
most.' 
</p>
               <p>`But if I must go, I will go alone: if you must stay, it is needless 
to waste your time in the journey there and back.' 
</p>
               <p>But he did not like the idea of sending me alone. 
</p>
               <p>`Why, what helpless creature do you take me for,' I replied, `that 
you cannot trust me to go a hundred miles in our own carriage with 
our own footman and maid to attend me? If you come with me I shall 
assuredly keep you. But tell me, Arthur, what is this tiresome 
business; and why did you never mention it before?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is only a little business with my lawyer,' said he; and he told 
me something about a piece of property he wanted to sell in order to 
pay off a part of the encumbrances on his estate; but either the 
account was a little confused or I was rather dull of comprehension, 
for I could not clearly understand how that should keep him in town 
a fortnight after me. Still less can I now comprehend how it should 
keep him a month—for it is nearly that time since I left him, and 
no signs of his return as yet, in every letter he promises to be 
with me in a few days, and every time deceives me—or deceives 
himself. His excuses are vague and insufficient. I cannot doubt that 
he is got among his former companions again—Oh, why did I leave 
him? I wish—I do intensely wish he would return! 
</p>
               <p>June 29th.—No Arthur yet; and for many days I have been looking and 
longing in vain for a letter. His letters, when they come, are 
kind—if fair words and endearing epithets can give them a claim to 
the title—but very short, and full of trivial excuses and promises 
that I cannot trust; and yet how anxiously I look forward to them! 
how eagerly I open and devour one of those little, hastily-scribbled 
returns for the three or four long letters, hitherto unanswered, he 
has had from me! 
</p>
               <p>Oh, it is cruel to leave me so long alone! He knows I have no one 
but Rachel to speak to, for we have no neighbours here, except the 
Hargraves, whose residence I can dimly descry from these upper 
windows embosomed among those low, woody hills beyond the dale. I 
was glad when I learnt that Milicent was so near us; and her company 
would be a soothing solace to me now, but she is still in town with 
her mother: there is no one at the Grove but little Esther and her 
French governess, for Walter is always away, I saw that paragon of 
manly perfections in London: he seemed scarcely to merit the 
eulogiums of his mother and sister, though he certainly appeared 
more conversable and agreeable than Lord Lowborough, more candid and 
high-minded than Mr Grimsby, and more polished and gentlemanly than 
Mr Hattersley, Arthur's only other friend whom he judged fit to 
introduce to me—Oh, Arthur, why won't you come! why won't you write 
to me at least! You talked about my health—how can you expect me to 
gather bloom and vigour here, pining in solitude and restless 
anxiety from day to day?—It would serve you right to come back and 
find my good looks entirely wasted away. I would beg my uncle and 
aunt, or my brother, to come and see me, but I do not like to 
complain of my loneliness to them,—and indeed, loneliness is the 
least of my sufferings; but what is he doing?—what is it that keeps 
him away? It is this ever-recurring question and the horrible 
suggestions it raises that distract me. 
</p>
               <p>July 3rd.—My last bitter letter has wrung from him an answer at 
last,—and a rather longer one than usual; but still, I don't know 
what to make of it, He playfully abuses me for the gall and vinegar 
of my latest effusion, tells me I can have no conception of the 
multitudinous engagements that keep him away, but avers that, in 
spite of them all, he will assuredly be with me before the close of 
next week; though it is impossible for a man, so circumstanced as he 
is, to fix the precise day of his return: meantime, he exhorts me to 
the exercise of patience, `that first of woman's virtues,' and 
desires me to remember the saying, `Absence makes the heart grow 
fonder,' and comfort myself with the assurance that the longer he 
stays away, the better he shall love me when he red and till he does 
return, he begs I will continue to write to him constantly, for, 
though he is sometimes too idle and often too busy to answer my 
letters as they come, he likes to receive them daily, and if I 
fulfil my threat of punishing his seeming neglect by ceasing to 
write, he shall be so angry that he will do his utmost to forget me. 
He adds this piece of intelligence respecting poor Milicent 
Hargrave:— 
</p>
               <p>`Your little friend Milicent is likely, before long, to follow your 
example, and take upon her the yoke of matrimony in con junction 
with a friend of mine. Hattersley, you know, has not yet fulfilled 
his direful threat of throwing his precious person away on the first 
old maid that chose to evince a tenderness for him; but he still 
preserves a resolute determination to see himself a married man 
before the year is out: “Only,” said he to me, “I must have somebody 
that will let me have my own way in everything—not like <hi>your</hi>
wife, Huntingdon; she is a charming creature, but she looks as if 
she had a will of her own, and could play the vixen upon occasion.” 
(I thought, “You're right there, man,” but I didn't say so.) “I must 
have some good, quiet soul that will let me just do what I like and 
go where I like, keep at home or stay away, with out a word of 
reproach or complaint; for I can't do with being bothered.” “Well,” 
said I, “I know somebody that will suit you to a tee, if you don't 
care for money, and that's Hargrave's sister, Milicent,” He desired 
to be introduced to her forthwith, for he said he had plenty of the 
needful himself—or should have, when his old governor chose to quit 
the stage. So you see, Helen, I have managed pretty well, both for 
your friend and mine.' 
</p>
               <p>Poor Milicent! But I cannot imagine she will ever be led to accept 
such a suitor—one so repugnant to all her ideas of a man to be 
honoured and loved. 
</p>
               <p>5th.—Alas! I was mistaken, I have got a long letter from her this 
mornIng, telling me she is already engaged, and expects to be 
married before the close of the month. 
</p>
               <p>`I hardly know what to say about it,' she writes, `or what to think. 
To tell you the truth, Helen, I don't like the thought of it at all. 
If I <hi>am</hi> to be Mr Hattersley's wife, I must try to love him; 
and I do try with all my might; but I have made very little progress 
yet; and the worst symptom of the case is, that the further he is 
from me the better like him: he frightens me with his abrupt manners 
and strange hectoring ways, and I dread the thought of marrying him. 
“Then why have you accepted him?” you will ask; and I didn't know I 
had accepted him; but mamma tells me I have, and he seems to think 
so too. I certainly didn't mean to do so; but I did not like to give 
him a flat refusal for fear mamma should be grieved and angry (for I 
knew she wished me to marry him), and I wanted to talk to her first 
about it, so I gave him what I thought was an evasive, half negative 
answer; but she says it was as good as an acceptance, and he would 
think me very capricious if I were to attempt to draw back—and 
indeed, I was so confused and frightened at the moment, I can hardly 
tell what I said. And next time I saw him, he accosted me in all 
confidence as his aced bride, and immediately began to settle 
matters with mamma. I had not courage to contradict them then, and 
how can I do it now? I cannot: they would think me mad, Besides, 
mamma is so delighted with the idea of the match; she thinks she has 
managed so well for me; and I cannot bear to disappoint her. I do 
object sometimes, and tell her what I feel, but you don't know how 
she talks. Mr Hattersley, you know, is the son of a rich banker, and 
as Esther and I have no fortunes and Walter very little, our dear 
mamma is very anxious to see us all well married, that is, united to 
rich partners—it is not <hi>my</hi> idea of being well married, but 
she means it all for the best. She says when I am safe off her hands 
it will be such a relief to her mind; and she assures me it will be 
a good thing for the family as well as for me. Even Walter is 
pleased at the prospect, and when I confessed my reluctance to him, 
he said it was all childish nonsense. Do <hi>you</hi> think it 
nonsense, Helen? I should not care if I could see any prospect of 
being able to love and admire him, but I can't. There is nothing 
about him to hang one's ester and affection upon: he is do 
diametrically opposite to what I imagined-my husband should be. Do 
write to me, and say all you can to encourage me. Don't attempt to 
dissuade me, for my fate is fixed: preparations for the important 
event are already going on around me; and don't say a word against 
Mr Hattersley, for I want to think well of him; and though I have 
spoken against him my self, it is for the last time: hereafter, I 
shall never permit myself to utter a word in his dispraise, however 
he may seem to deserve it; and whoever ventures to speak slightingly 
of the man I have promised to love, to honour, and obey  must expect 
my serious displeasure. After all, I think he is quite as good as Mr 
Huntingdon, if not better: and yet, you <hi>love</hi> him, and seem to 
be happy and contented; and perhaps I may manage as well. You must 
tell me, if you can, that Mr Hattersley is better than he 
seems—that he is upright, honourable, and open-hearted—in fact, a 
perfect diamond in the rough. He may be all this, but I don't know 
him—I know only the exterior and what I trust is the worst part of 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>She concludes with `Goodbye, dear Helen, I am waiting anxiously for 
your advice-but mind you let it be all on the right side.' 
</p>
               <p>Alas! poor Milicent, what encouragement can I give you?—or what 
advice—except that it is better to make a bold stand now, though at 
the expense of disappointing and angering both mother and brother, 
and lover, than to devote your whole life, hereafter, to misery and 
vain regret? 
</p>
               <p>Saturday, 13th. The week is over, and he is not come. All the sweet 
summer is passing away without one breath of pleasure to me or 
benefit to him. And I had all along been looking forward to this 
season with the fond, delusive hope that we should enjoy it so 
sweetly together; and that, with God's help and my exertions, it 
would be the means of elevating his mind, and refining his taste to 
a due appreciation of the salutary and pure delights of nature. and 
peace, and holy love. But now,— at evening, when I see the round, 
red sun sink quietly down behind those woody hills, leaving them 
sleeping in a warm, red, golden haze, I only think another lovely 
day is lost to him and me;—and at morning, when rouse' by the 
flutter and chirp of the sparrows, and the gleeful twitter of the 
swallows—all intent upon feeding their young, and full of life and 
joy in their own little frames—I open the window to inhale the 
balmy, soul-reviving air and look out upon the lovely landscape, 
laughing in dew and sunshine—I too often shame that glorious scene 
with tears of thankless misery, because <hi>he</hi> cannot feel its 
freshening influence;—and when I wander in the ancient woods, and 
meet the little wild flowers smiling in my path, or sit in the 
shadow of our noble ash-trees by the waterside with their branches 
gently swaying in the light summer breeze that murmurs through their 
feathery foliage—my ears full of that low music mingled with the 
dreamy hum of insects, my eyes abstractedly gazing on the glassy 
surface of the little lake before me, with the trees that crowd 
about its bank, some gracefully bending to kiss its waters, some 
rearing their stately heads high above, but stretching their wide 
arms over its margin, all faithfully mirrored far, far down in its 
glassy depth—though sometimes the images are partially broken by 
the sport of aquatic insects, and sometimes, for a moment, the whole 
is shivered into trembling fragments by a transient breeze that 
swept the surface too roughly,—still I have no pleasure; for the 
greater the happiness that nature sets before me, the more I lament 
that <hi>he</hi> is not here to taste it: the greater the bliss we 
might enjoy together, the more I feel our present `wretchedness 
apart (yes, ours; he must be wretched, though he may not know it); 
and the more my senses are pleased, the more my heart is oppressed; 
for he keeps it with him confined amid the dust and smoke of 
London,—perhaps shut up within the walls of his own abominable 
club. 
</p>
               <p>But most of all, at night, when I enter my lonely chamber. and look 
out upon the summer moon, `sweet regent of the sky,' floating above 
me in the `black blue vault of heaven,' shedding a flood of silver 
radiance over park, and wood, and water, so pure, so peaceful, so 
divine,—and think, `Where is he now?—what is he doing at this 
moment?—wholly unconscious of this heavenly scene,—perhaps 
revelling with his boon companions, perhaps—' God help me, it is 
too—too much! 
</p>
               <p>23rd. Thank Heaven, he is come at last! But how altered!—flushed 
and feverish, listless and languid, his beauty strangely diminished, 
his vigour and vivacity quite departed. I have not upbraided him by 
word or look; I have not even asked him what he has been doing. I 
have not the heart to do it, for I think he is ashamed of 
himself—he must be so indeed,—and such enquiries could not fail to 
be painful to both. My forbearance pleases him—touches him even, I 
am inclined to think. He says he is glad to be home again, and God 
knows how glad I am to get him back, even as he is. He lies on the 
sofa nearly all day long; and I play and sing to him for hours 
together. I write his letters for him, and get him everything he 
wants; and sometimes I read to him, and sometimes I talk, and 
sometimes only sit by him and soothe him with silent caresses. I 
know he does not deserve it; and I fear I am spoiling him; but this 
once, I will forgive him, freely and entirely—I will shame him into 
virtue if I can, and I will never let him leave me again. 
</p>
               <p>He is pleased with my attentions—it may be, grateful for them. He 
likes to have me near him; and though he is peevish and testy with 
his servants and his dogs, he is gentle and kind to me, What he 
would be, if I did not so watchfully anticipate his wants, and so 
carefully avoid, or immediately desist from, doing anything that has 
a tendency to irritate or disturb him, with however little reason, I 
cannot tell. How intensely I wish he were worthy of all this care! 
Last night as I sat beside him, with his head in my lap, passing my 
fingers through his beautiful curls, this thought made my eyes 
overflow with sorrowful tears—as it often does,—but this time, a 
tear fell on his face and made him look up. He smiled, but not 
insultingly. 
</p>
               <p>`Dear Helen!' he said—`why do you cry? you know that I love you 
(and he pressed my hand to his feverish lips), `and what more could 
you desire?' 
</p>
               <p>`Only, Arthur, that you would love <hi>yourself</hi>, as truly and as 
faithfully as you are loved by me.' 
</p>
               <p>`That would be hard indeed!' he replied, tenderly squeezing my 
hand, 
</p>
               <p>I don't know whether he fully understood my meaning, but he 
smiled—thoughtfully and even sadly—a most unusual thing with 
him;—and then he closed his eyes and fell asleep, looking as 
careless and sinless as a child. As I watched that placid slumber, 
my heart swelled fuller than ever, and my tears flowed 
unrestrained. 
</p>
               <p>August 24. Arthur is himself again, as lusty and reckless, as light 
of heart and head as ever, and as restless and hard to amuse as a 
spoilt child,—and almost as full of mischief too, especially when 
wet weather keeps him within doors. I wish he had some thing to do, 
some useful trade, or profession, or employment—anything to occupy 
his head or his hands for a few hours a day, and give him something 
besides his own pleasure to think about, If he would play the 
country gentleman, and attend to the farm—but that he knows nothing 
about, and won't give his mind to consider,—or if he would take up 
with some literary study, or learn to draw or to play—as he is so 
fond of music, I often try to persuade him to learn the piano, but 
he is far too idle for such an undertaking: he has no more idea of 
exerting himself to overcome obstacles than he has of restraining 
his natural appetites; and these two things are the ruin of him. I 
lay them both to the charge of his harsh yet careless father and his 
madly indulgent mother. If ever I am a mother I will zealously 
strive against this crime of over-indulgence—I can hardly give it a 
milder name when I think of the evils it brings. 
</p>
               <p>Happily, it will soon be the shooting season, and then, if the 
weather permit, he will find occupation enough in the pursuit and 
destruction of the partridges and pheasants: we have no grouse, or 
he might have been similarly occupied at this moment, instead of 
lying under the acacia tree pulling poor Dash's ears. But he says it 
is dull work shooting alone; he must have a friend or two to help 
him. 
</p>
               <p>`Let them be tolerably decent then, Arthur,' said I—The word 
`friend,' in his mouth, makes me shudder: I know it was some of his 
`friends' that induced him to stay behind me in London, and kept him 
away so long—indeed, from what he has unguardedly told me, or 
hinted from time to time, I cannot doubt that he frequently showed 
them my letters, to let them see how fondly his wife watched over 
his interests and how keenly she regretted his absence; and that 
they induced him to remain week after week, and to plunge into all 
manner of excesses to avoid being laughed at for a wife-ridden fool, 
and, perhaps, to show how far he could venture to go without danger 
of shaking the fond creature's devoted attachment. It is a hateful 
idea, but I cannot believe it is a false one. 
</p>
               <p>`Well,' replied he, `I thought of Lord Lowborough for one; but there 
is no possibility of getting him without his better half, our mutual 
friend Annabella; so we must ask them both. You're not afraid of 
her, are you, Helen?' he asked, with a mischievous twinkle in his 
eyes. 
</p>
               <p>`Of course not,' I answered: `why should I?—And who besides?' 
</p>
               <p>`Hargrave for one—he will be glad to come, though his own place is 
so near, for he has little enough land of his own to shoot over, and 
we can extend our depredations into it, if we like;—and he is 
thoroughly respectable, you know, Helen, quite a lady's man:—and I 
think, Grimsby for another: he's a decent, quiet fellow 
enough—you'll not object to Grimsby?' 
</p>
               <p>`I hate him; but however, if you wish it, I'll try to endure his 
presence for a while.' 
</p>
               <p>`All a prejudice, Helen—a mere woman's antipathy.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; I have solid grounds for my dislike. And is that all?' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, yes, I think so. Hattersley will be too busy billing and 
cooing with his bride to have much time to spare for guns and dogs, 
at present,' he replied.—And that reminds me that I have had 
several letters from Milicent since her marriage, and that she 
either is or pretends to be quite reconciled to her lot. She 
professes to have discovered numberless virtues and perfections in 
her husband, some of which, I fear, less partial eyes would fail to 
distinguish, though they sought them carefully with tears; and now 
that she is accustomed to his loud voice and abrupt, un courteous 
manners, she affirms she finds no difficulty in loving him as a wife 
should do, and begs I will burn that letter wherein she spoke so 
unadvisedly against him. So that I trust she may yet be happy; but 
if she is, it will he entirely the reward of her own goodness of 
heart; for had she chosen to consider herself the victim of fate, or 
of her mother's worldly wisdom, she might have been thoroughly 
miserable; and, if, for duty's sake, she had not made every effort 
to love her husband, she would doubtless have hated him to the end 
of her days.

            <div xml:id="c1.26" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI</head>
               <head>The Guests</head>
               <p>Sept. 23rd. Our guests arrived about three weeks ago. Lord and Lady 
Lowborough have now been married above eight months; and I will do 
the lady the credit to say that her husband is quite an altered man: 
his looks, his spirits, and his temper are all perceptibly changed 
for the better since I last saw him. But there is room for 
improvement still. He is not always cheerful nor always contented, 
and she often complains of his ill humour, which, how ever, of all 
persons, <hi>she</hi> ought to be the last to accuse him of, as he 
never displays it against her, except for such conduct as would 
provoke a saint He adores her still, and would go to the world's end 
to please her, She knows her power, and she uses it too; but well 
knowing that to wheedle and coax is safer than to command, she 
judiciously tempers her despotism with flattery and blandishments 
enough to make him deem himself a favoured and a happy man. And yet, 
at times, a sombre shadow overclouds his brow even In her presence, 
but evidently the result of despondency rather than of ill humour, 
and generally occasioned by some display of her ill-regulated temper 
or misguided mind—some wanton trampling upon his most cherished 
opinions—some seck less disregard of principle that makes him 
bitterly regret that she is not as good as she is charming and 
beloved. I pity him from my heart, for I know the misery of such 
regrets. 
</p>
               <p>But she has another way of tormenting him, In which I am a 
fellow-sufferer—or might be, if I chose to regard myself as such. 
This is by openly but not too glaringly coquetting with Mr 
Huntingdon, who is quite willing to be her partner in the game; but 
I don't care for it, because with him, I know there is nothing but 
personal vanity and a mischievous desire to excite my jealousy, and 
perhaps to torment his friend; and she, no doubt, is actuated by 
much the same motives; only there is more of malice and less of 
playfulness in <hi>her</hi> manoeuvres. It is obviously, therefore, my 
interest to disappoint them both, as far as I am concerned, by 
preserving a cheerful, undisturbed serenity throughout; and 
accordingly I endeavour to show the fullest confidence In my husband 
and the greatest indifference to the arts of my attractive guest. I 
have never reproached the former but once, and that was for laughing 
at Lord Lowborough's depressed and anxious countenance one evening, 
when they had both been particularly provoking; and then, indeed, I 
said a good deal on the subject, and rebuked him sternly enough; but 
he only laughed, and said— 
</p>
               <p>`You can feel for him, Helen—can't you?' 
</p>
               <p>`I can feel for anyone that is unjustly treated,' I replied, `and I 
can feel for those that injure them too,' 
</p>
               <p>`Why Helen, you are as jealous as he is!' cried he, laughing still 
more; and I found it impossible to convince him of his mistake. So 
from that time I have carefully refrained from any notice of the 
subject whatever, and left Lord Lowborough to take care of himself. 
He either has not the sense or the power to follow my example, 
though he does try to conceal his uneasiness as well as he can; but 
still, it will appear in his face, and his ill humour will peep out 
at intervals, though not in the expression of open resentment—they 
never go far enough for that. But I confess I do feel jealous at 
times—most painfully, bitterly so—when she sings and plays to him, 
and he hangs over the instrument and dwells upon her voice with no 
affected interest; for then, I know he is really delighted, and I 
have no power to awaken similar fervour. I can amuse and please him 
with my simple songs, but not delight him thus. 
</p>
               <p>I might retaliate if chose, for Mr Hargrave is disposed to be very 
polite and attentive to me as his hostess—especially so when Arthur 
is the most neglectful, whether in mistaken compassion for me, or 
ambitious to show off his own good breeding by comparison with his 
friend's remissness, I cannot tell; but in either case, his 
civilities are highly distasteful to me. If Arthur is a little 
careless, of course it is unpleasant to have the fault exaggerated 
by contrast; and to be pitied as a neglected wife when I am not 
such, is an insult I can ill endure. But for hospitality's sake, I 
endeavour to suppress my impulse of scarcely reasonable resentment, 
and behave with decent civility to our guest, who, to give him his 
due, is by no means a disagreeable companion: he has good 
conversational powers and considerable Information and taste, and 
talks about things that Arthur never could be brought to discuss, or 
to feel any interest in. But Arthur dislikes me to talk to him, and 
is visibly annoyed by his commonest acts of politeness: not that my 
husband has any unworthy suspicions of me—or of his friend either, 
as I believe—but he dislikes me to have any pleasure but in 
himself, any shadow of homage or kindness but such as he chooses to 
vouchsafe: he knows he is my sun, but when he chooses to withhold 
his light, he would have my sky to be all darkness; he cannot bear 
that I should have a moon to mitigate the deprivation. This is 
unjust; and I am sometimes tempted to tease him accordingly; but I 
won't yield to the temptation: if he should carry his trifling with 
my feelings too far, I shall find some other means of checking 
him. 
</p>
               <p>28th.—Yesterday we all went to the Grove, Mr Hargrave's much 
neglected home. His mother frequently asks us over that she may have 
the pleasure of her dear Walter's company; and this time she had 
invited us to a dinner-party, and got together as many of the 
country gentry as were within reach to meet us. The entertainment 
was very well got up; but I could not help thinking about the cost 
of it all the time. I don't like Mrs Hargrave; she is a hard, 
pretentious, worldly-minded woman. She has money enough to live very 
comfortably, if she only knew how to use it judiciously, and had 
taught her son to do the same; but she is ever straining to keep up 
appearances, with that despicable pride that shuns the semblance of 
poverty as of a shameful crime. She grinds her dependants, pinches 
her servants, and deprives even her daughters and herself of the 
real comforts of life, because she will not con sent to yield the 
palm in outward show to those who have three times her wealth, and, 
above all, because she is determined her cherished son shall be 
enabled to `hold up his head with the high est gentleman in the 
land.' This same son, I imagine, is a man of expensive habits—no 
reckless spendthrift, and no abandoned sensualist, but one who likes 
to have `everything handsome about him,' and to go to a certain 
length in youthful indulgences—not so much gratify his own tastes 
as to maintain his reputation as a man of fashion In the world, and 
a respectable fellow among his own lawless companions; while he is 
too selfish to consider how many comforts might be obtained for his 
fond mother and sisters with the money he thus wastes upon himself: 
as long as they can contrive to make a respectable appearance once a 
year when they come to town, he gives himself little concern about 
their private stintings and struggles at home. This is a harsh 
judgment to form of `dear, noble-minded, generous-hearted Walter,' 
but I fear it is too just. 
</p>
               <p>Mrs Hargrave's anxiety to make good matches for her daughters is 
partly the cause and partly the result of these errors: by making a 
figure in the world and showing them off to advantage, she hopes to 
obtain better chances for them; and by thus living beyond her 
legitimate means and lavishing so much on their brother, she renders 
them portionless, and makes them burdens on her hands. Poor 
Milicent, I fear, has already fallen a sacrifice to the manoeuvrings 
of this mistaken mother, who congratulates herself on having so 
satisfactorily discharged her maternal duty, and hopes to do as well 
for Esther. But Esther is a child as yet—a little merry romp of 
fourteen: as honest-hearted, and as guileless and simple as her 
sister, but with a fearless spirit of her own, that, I fancy, her 
mother will find some difficulty in bending to her purposes.

               <head>A Misdemeanour</head>
               <p>OCTOBER 9th.—While the gentlemen are ranging the woods and Lady 
Lowborough is busy writing her letters, I will return to my 
chronicle for the purpose of recording sayings and doings, the last 
of the kind I hope I shall ever have cause to describe. 
</p>
               <p>It was on the night of the 4th, a little after tea, that Annabella 
had been singing and playing, with Arthur as usual at her side: she 
had ended her song, but still she sat at the instrument; and he 
stood leaning on the back of her chair, conversing in scarcely 
audible tones, with his face in very close proximity with hers. I 
looked at Lord Lowborough. He was at the other end of the room, 
talking with Messrs Hargrave and Grimsby; but I saw him dart, 
towards his lady and his host, a quick, impatient glance, expressive 
of intense disquietude, at which Grimsby smiled. Determined to 
interrupt the tête-à-tête, I rose, and selecting a 
piece of music from the music stand, stepped up to the piano, 
intending to ask the lady to play it; but I stood transfixed and 
speechless in seeing her seated there, listening with what seemed an 
exultant smile on her flushed face, to his soft murmurings, with her 
hand quietly surrendered to his clasp. The blood rushed first to my 
heart and then to my head—for there was more than this; almost at 
the moment of my approach, he cast a hurried glance over his 
shoulder towards the other occupants of the room, and then ardently 
pressed the unresisting hand to his lips. On raising his eyes he 
beheld me and dropped them again, confounded and dismayed. She saw 
me too, and confronted me with a look of hard defiance I laid the 
music on the piano, and retired. I felt ill; but I did not leave the 
room: happily, it was getting late and could not be long before the 
company dispersed. I went to the fire and leant my head against the 
chimney-piece. in a minute or two, someone asked me if I felt 
unwell. I did not answer—indeed, at the time I knew not what was 
said—but I mechanically looked up, and saw Mr Hargrave standing 
beside me on the rug. 
</p>
               <p>`Shall I get you a glass of wine?' said he. 
</p>
               <p>`No, thank you,' I replied; and turning from him, I looked round. 
Lady Lowborough was beside her husband, bending over him as he sat, 
with her hand on his shoulder, softly talking and smiling in his 
face; and Arthur was at the table turning over a book of engravings. 
I seated myself in the nearest chair; and Mr Hargrave, finding his 
services were not desired, judiciously with drew. Shortly after, the 
company broke up, and as the guests were retiring to their rooms, 
Arthur approached me, smiling with the utmost assurance. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you <hi>very</hi> angry, Helen?' murmured he. 
</p>
               <p>`This is no jest, Arthur,' said I, seriously, but as calmly as I 
could—`unless you think it a jest to lose my affection forever.' 
</p>
               <p>`What! so bitter?' he exclaimed, laughingly clasping my hand between 
both his; but I snatched it away, in indignation—almost in disgust, 
for he was obviously affected with wine. 
</p>
               <p>`Then I must go down on my knees,' said he; and kneeling before me 
with clasped hands uplifted in mock humiliation, he continued 
imploringly—`Forgive me, Helen!—dear Helen, forgive me, and I'll 
<hi>never</hi> do it again!' and burying his face in his handkerchief, 
he affected to sob aloud. 
</p>
               <p>Leaving him thus employed, I took my candle, and slipping quietly 
from the room, hastened upstairs as fast as I could. But he soon 
discovered that I had left him, and rushing up after me, caught me 
in his arms, just as I had entered the chamber, and was about to 
shut the door in his face. 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, by Heaven, you shan't escape me so!' he cried. Then, 
alarmed at my agitation, he begged me not to put myself in such a 
passion, telling me I was white in the face, and should kill myself 
if I did so. 
</p>
               <p>`Let me go then,' I murmured; and immediately he released me—and it 
was well he did, for I was really in a passion. I sunk into the 
easy-hair and endeavoured to compose myself, for I wanted to speak 
to him calmly. He stood beside me, but did not venture to touch me 
or to speak, for a few seconds; then approaching a little nearer, he 
dropped on one knee—not in mock humility, but to bring himself 
nearer my level, and leaning his hand on the arm of the chair, he 
began in a low voice— 
</p>
               <p>`It is all nonsense, Helen—a jest, a mere nothing—not worth a 
thought. Will you <hi>never</hi> learn?' he continued, more boldly, 
`that you have nothing to fear from me? that I love you wholly and 
entirely?—or if,' he added, with a lurking smile, `I ever give a 
thought to another, you may well spare it, for those fancies are 
here and gone like a flash of lightning, while my love for you burns 
on steadily, and for ever like the sun. You little exorbitant 
tyrant, will not <hi>that</hi>—' 
</p>
               <p>`Be quiet a moment, will you, Arthur,' said I, `and listen to 
me—and don't think I'm in a jealous fury: I am perfectly calm. Feel 
my hand.' And I gravely extended it towards him—but closed it upon 
his with an energy that seemed to disprove the assertion, and made 
him smile. `You needn't smile, sir,' said I, still tightening my 
grasp, and looking steadfastly on him till he almost quailed before 
me. `You may think it all very fine, Mr Huntingdon, to amuse 
yourself with rousing my jealousy; but take care you don't rouse my 
hate instead. And when you have once extinguished my love, you will 
find it no easy matter to kindle it again.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Helen, I won't repeat the offence. But I meant nothing by it, 
I assure you. I had taken too much wine, and I was scarcely myself, 
at the time.' 
</p>
               <p>`You often take too much;—and that is another practice I detest.' 
He looked up astonished at my warmth. `Yes,' I continued. `I never 
mentioned it before, because I was ashamed to do so; but now I'll 
tell you that it distresses me, and may disgust me, if you go on and 
suffer the habit to grow upon you, as it will, if you don't check it 
in time. But the whole system of your conduct to Lady Lowborough is 
not referable to wine; and this night you knew perfectly well what 
you were doing.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I'm sorry for it,' replied he, with more of sulkiness than 
contrition: `what more would you have?' 
</p>
               <p>`You are sorry that I saw you, no doubt,' I answered, coldly. 
</p>
               <p>`If you had not seen me,' he muttered, fixing his eyes on the 
carpet, `it would have done no harm.' 
</p>
               <p>My heart felt ready to burst; but I resolutely swallowed back my 
emotion, and answered calmly, `You think not?' 
</p>
               <p>`No,' replied he, boldly. `After all, what have I done? It's 
nothing—except as you choose to make it a subject of accusation and 
distress.' 
</p>
               <p>`What would Lord Lowborough, your <hi>friend</hi>, think, if he knew 
all? or what would you yourself think, if he or any other bad acted 
the same part to me, throughout, as you have to Annabella?' 
</p>
               <p>`I would blow his brains out.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well then, Arthur, how can you call it nothing—an offence for 
which you would think yourself justified in blowing another man's 
brains out? Is it nothing to trifle with your friend's feelings and 
mine—to endeavour to steal a woman's affections from her 
husband—what he values more than his gold, and therefore what it is 
more dishonest to take? Are the marriage vows a jest; and is it 
nothing to make it your sport to break them, and to tempt another to 
do the same? Can I love a man that does such things, and coolly 
maintains it is nothing?' 
</p>
               <p>`You are breaking your marriage vows yourself,' said he, indignantly 
rising and pacing to and fro. `You promised to honour and obey me, 
and now you attempt to hector over me, and threaten and accuse me 
and call me worse than a highwayman, If it were not for your 
situation, Helen, I would not submit to it so tamely. I won't be 
dictated to by a woman, though she be my wife.' 
</p>
               <p>`What will you do then? Will you go on till I hate you; and then 
accuse me of breaking my vows?' 
</p>
               <p>He was silent a moment, and then replied,—`You never will hate me.' 
Returning and resuming his former position at my feet, he repeated 
more vehemently—`You cannot hate me, as long as I love you.' 
</p>
               <p>`But how can I believe that you love me, if you continue to act in 
this way? Just imagine yourself in my place: would you think I loved 
<hi>you</hi>, if I did so? Would you believe my protestations, and 
honour and trust me under such circumstances?' 
</p>
               <p>`The cases are different,' he replied. `It is a woman's nature to be 
constant—to love one and one only, blindly, tenderly, and for 
ever—bless them, dear creatures! and you above them all—but you 
must have some commiseration for us, Helen; you must give us a 
little more licence, for as Shakespeare has it— 
<q>
                     <l>“However we do praise ourselves, </l>
                     <l>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, </l>
                     <l>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won </l>
                     <l>Than women's are.” </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>`Do you mean by that, that your fancies are lost to me, and won by 
Lady Lowborough?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; Heaven is my witness that I think her mere dust and ashes in 
comparison with you,—and shall continue to think so, unless you 
drive me from you by too much severity. She is a daughter of earth; 
you are an angel of heaven; only be not too austere in your 
divinity, and remember that I am a poor, fallible mortal. Come now, 
Helen; won't you forgive me?' he said, gently taking my hand, and 
looking up with an innocent smile. 
</p>
               <p>`If I do, you will repeat the offence.' 
</p>
               <p>`I swear by—' 
</p>
               <p>`Don't swear; I'll believe your word as well as your oath. I wish I 
could have confidence in either.' 
</p>
               <p>`Try me then, Helen: only trust and pardon me this once, and you 
shall see! Come, I am in hell's torments till you speak the 
word.' 
</p>
               <p>I did not speak it, but I put my hand on his shoulder and kissed his 
forehead, and then burst into tears. He embraced me tenderly; and we 
have been good friends ever since. He has been decently temperate at 
table, and well-conducted towards Lady Lowborough. The first day, he 
held himself aloof from her, as far as he could without any flagrant 
breach of hospitality: since that, he has been friendly and civil 
but nothing more—in my presence, at least, nor, I think, at any 
other time; for she seems haughty and displeased, and Lord 
Lowborough is manifestly more cheerful, and more cordial towards his 
host, than before. But I shall be glad when they are gone, for I 
have so little love for Annabella that it is quite a task to be 
civil to her, and as she is the only woman here besides myself, we 
are necessarily thrown so much together. Next time Mrs Hargrave 
calls, I shall hail her advent as quite a relief. I have a good mind 
to ask Arthur's leave to invite the old lady to stay with us till 
our guests depart. I think I will. She will take it as a kind 
attention, and, though I have little relish for her society, she 
will be truly welcome as a third to stand between Lady Low borough 
and me. 
</p>
               <p>The first time the latter and I were alone together, after that 
unhappy evening, was an hour or two after breakfast on the following 
day, when the gentlemen were gone out after the usual time spent in 
the writing of letters, the reading of newspapers, and desultory 
conversation, We sat silent for two or three minutes. She was busy 
with her work and I was running over the columns of a paper from 
which I had extracted all the pith some twenty minutes before. It 
was a moment of painful embarrassment to me, and I thought it must 
be infinitely more so to her; but it seems I was mistaken. She was 
the first to speak; and, smiling with the coolest assurance, she 
began,— 
</p>
               <p>`Your husband was merry last night, Helen: is he often so?' 
</p>
               <p>My blood boiled in my face; but it was better she should seem to 
attribute his conduct to this than to anything else. 
</p>
               <p>`No,' replied I, `and never will be so again, I trust.' 
</p>
               <p>`You gave him a curtain lecture, did you?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; but I told him I disliked such conduct, and he promised me not 
to repeat it.' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>thought</hi> he looked rather subdued this morning,' she 
continued; `and you, Helen; you've been weeping, I see—that's our 
grand resource, you know—but doesn't it make your eyes smart?—and 
do you always find it to answer?' 
</p>
               <p>`I never cry for effect; nor can I conceive how anyone can.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I don't know: I never had occasion to try it;—but I think if 
Lowborough were to commit such improprieties, I'd make him cry. I 
don't wonder at your being angry, for I'm sure I'd give my husband a 
lesson he would not soon forget for a lighter offence than that. But 
then he never <hi>will</hi> do anything of the kind; for I keep him in 
too good order for that.' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you sure you don't arrogate too much of the credit to yourself? 
Lord Lowborough was quite as remarkable for his abstemiousness for 
some time before you married him, as he is now, I have heard.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, about the <hi>wine</hi> you mean—yes, he's safe enough for that, 
And as to looking askance to another woman—he's safe enough for 
that too, while I live, for he worships the very ground I tread 
on.' 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed! and are you sure you deserve it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, as to that, I can't say: you know we're all fallible 
creatures, Helen; we none of us deserve to be worshipped. But are 
you sure your darling Huntingdon deserves all the love you give to 
<hi>him</hi>?' 
</p>
               <p>I knew not what to answer to this. I was burning with anger; but I 
suppressed all outward manifestations of it, and only bit my lip and 
pretended to arrange my work. 
</p>
               <p>`At any rate,' resumed she, pursuing her advantage, `you can console 
yourself with the assurance that you are worthy of all the love he 
gives to you.' 
</p>
               <p>`You flatter me,' said I; `but at least, I can try to be worthy of 
it.' And then I turned the conversation.

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
               <head>Parental Feelings</head>
               <p>DECEMBER 25th.—Last Christmas I was a bride, with a heart 
overflowing with present bliss, and full of ardent hopes for the 
future—though not unmingled with foreboding fears. Now I am a wife: 
my bliss is sobered, but not destroyed; my hopes diminished, but not 
departed; my fears increased, but not yet thoroughly 
confirmed;—and, thank Heaven, I am a mother too. God has sent me a 
soul to educate for heaven, and given me a new and calmer bliss, and 
stronger hopes to comfort me. But where hope rises fear must lurk 
behind, and when I clasp my little darling to my breast, or hang 
over his slumbers with unutterable delight, and a world of hope 
within my heart, one of two thoughts is ever at hand to check my 
swelling bliss; the one: `He may be taken from me'; the other: `He 
may live to curse his own existence.' in the first, I have this 
consolation: that the bud, though plucked, would not be withered, 
only transplanted to a fitter soil to ripen and blow be neath a 
brighter sun; and though I might not cherish and watch my child's 
unfolding intellect, he would be snatched away from all the 
suffering and sins of earth; and my understanding tells me this 
would be no great evil; but my heart shrinks from the contemplation 
of such a possibility, and whispers I could not bear to see him die, 
and relinquish to the cold and cruel grave this cherished form, now 
warm with tender life, flesh of my flesh and shrine of that pure 
spark which it should be my life's sweet labour to keep unsullied 
from the world,—and ardently implores that Heaven would spare him 
still, to be my comfort and my joy, and me to be his shield, 
instructor, friend—to guide him along the perilous path of youth, 
and train him to be God's servant while on earth, a blessed and 
honoured saint in heaven. But in the other case, if he should live 
to disappoint my hopes, and frustrate all my efforts—to be a slave 
of sin, the victim of vice and misery, a curse to others and 
himself—Eternal Father, if Thou beholdest such a life before him, 
tear him from me now in spite of all my anguish, and take him from 
my bosom to thine own, while he is yet a guileless, unpolluted 
lamb! 
</p>
               <p>My little Arthur! there you lie in sweet, unconscious slumber, the 
tiny epitome of your father, but stainless yet as that pure snow, 
new-fallen from heaven—God shield thee from his errors! How will I 
watch and toil to guard thee from them! He wakes; his tiny arms are 
stretched towards me; his eyes unclose; they meet my gaze, but will 
not answer it. Little angel! you do not know me; you cannot think of 
me or love me yet; and yet how fervently my heart is knit to yours; 
how grateful I am for all the joy you give me! Would that your 
father could share it with me—that he could feel my love, my hope, 
and take an equal part in my resolves and projects for the 
future—nay, if he could but sympathize in half my views, and share 
one half my feelings, it would be indeed a blessing to both himself 
and me: it would elevate and purity his mind, and bind him closer to 
his home and me. 
</p>
               <p>Perhaps he will feel awakening interest and affection for his child 
as it grows older. At present, he is pleased with the acquisition, 
and hopes it will become a fine boy and a worthy heir; and that is 
nearly all I can say. At first, it was a thing to wonder and laugh 
at, not to touch: now, it is an object almost of indifference, 
except when his impatience is roused by its `utter helplessness' and 
`imperturbable stupidity' (as he calls it), or my too close 
attention to its wants. He frequently comes and sits beside me while 
I am busied with my maternal cares. I hoped at first it was for the 
pleasure of contemplating our priceless treasure; but I soon found 
it was only to enjoy my company, or escape the pains of solitude. He 
is kindly welcome of course, but the best compliment to a mother is 
to appreciate her little one. He shocked me very much on one 
occasion: it was about a fortnight after the birth of our son, and 
he was with me in the nursery. We had neither of us spoken for some 
time: I was lost in the contemplation of my nursling, and I thought 
he was similarly occupied—as far, at least, as I thought about him 
at all. But suddenly he startled me from my reverie by impatiently 
exclaiming,— 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, I shall positively hate that little wretch, if you worship 
it so madly! You are absolutely infatuated about it.' 
</p>
               <p>I looked up in astonishment, to see if he could be in earnest. 
</p>
               <p>`You have not a thought to spare for anything else,' he continued, 
in the same strain: `I may go or come, be present or absent, 
cheerful or sad; it's all the same to you. As long as you have that 
ugly little creature to dote upon, you care not a farthing what 
becomes of me.' 
</p>
               <p>`It is false, Arthur; when you enter the room, it always doubles my 
happiness; when you are near me, the sense of your presence delights 
me, though I don't look at you; and when I think about our child, I 
please myself with the idea that you share my thoughts and feelings, 
though I don't speak them.' 
</p>
               <p>`How the devil can I waste my thoughts and feelings on a little 
worthless idiot like that?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is your own son, Arthur,—or, If that consideration has no 
weight with you, it is mine; and you ought to respect my 
feelings.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, don't be cross; it was only a slip of the tongue,' pleaded 
he. `The little fellow is well enough, only I can't worship him as 
you do.' 
</p>
               <p>`You shall nurse him for me, as a punishment,' said I, rising to put 
my baby in its father's arms. 
</p>
               <p>`No, don't, Helen—don't!' cried he, in real disquietude. 
</p>
               <p>`I will: you'll love him better, when you feel the little creature 
in your arms.' 
</p>
               <p>I deposited the precious burden in his hands, and retreated to the 
other side of the room, laughing at the ludicrous, half-embarrassed 
air with which he sat, holding it at arm's length, and looking upon 
it as if it were some curious being of quite a different species to 
himself. 
</p>
               <p>`Come, take it, Helen; take it,' he cried, at length. `I shall drop 
it, If you don't.' 
</p>
               <p>Compassionating his distress—or rather the child's unsafe position, 
I relieved him of the charge. 
</p>
               <p>`Kiss it, Arthur; do—you've never kissed it yet!' said I, kneeling 
and presenting it before him. 
</p>
               <p>`I would rather kiss its mother,' replied he, embracIng me. `There 
now; won't that do as well?' 
</p>
               <p>I resumed my seat in the easy chair, and gave my little one a shower 
of gentle kisses to make up for its other parent's refusal. 
</p>
               <p>`There goes!' cried the jealous father, `That's more, in one minute, 
lavished on that little senseless, thankless, oyster, than you have 
given me these three weeks past.' 
</p>
               <p>`Come here then, you insatiable monopolist, and you shall have as 
many as you like, incorrigible and undeserving as you are.—There 
now, won't that suffice? I have a good mind never to give you 
another till you have learned to love my baby as a father 
should.' 
</p>
               <p>`I like the little devil—' 
</p>
               <p>`Arthur!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, the little angel—well enough,' and he pinched its delicate 
little nose to prove his affection, `only I can't love it—what is 
there to love? It can't love me—or you either; it can't understand 
a single word you say to it, or feel one spark of gratitude for all 
your kindness. Wait till it can show some little affection for me, 
and then I'll see about loving it. At present it is nothing more 
than a little selfish, senseless, sensualist, and if you see 
anything adorable in it, it's all very well—I only wonder how you 
can.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you were less selfish yourself, Arthur, you would not regard it 
in that light.' 
</p>
               <p>`Possibly not, my love; but so it is: there's no help for it.' 
</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX</head>
               <head>The Neighbour</head>
               <p>DEC. 25th, 1823. Another year is gone. My little Arthur lives and 
thrives. He is healthy but not robust, full of gentle playfulness 
and vivacity, already affectionate, and susceptible of passions and 
emotions it will be long ere he can find words to express. He has 
won his father's heart at last; and now my constant terror is, lest 
he should be ruined by that father's thoughtless indulgence. But I 
must beware of my own weakness too, for I never knew till now how 
strong are a parent's temptations to spoil an only child. 
</p>
               <p>I have need of consolation in my son, for (to this silent paper I 
may confess it) I have but little in my husband. I love him still; 
and he loves me, in his own way—but oh, how different from the love 
I could have given, and once had hoped to receive! how little real 
sympathy there exists between us; how many of my thoughts and 
feelings are gloomily cloistered within my own mind; how much of my 
higher and better self is indeed unmarried—doomed either to harden 
and sour in the sunless shade of solitude, or to quite degenerate 
and fall away for lack of nutriment in this unwholesome soil!—But, 
I repeat, I have no right to com plain: only let me state the 
truth—some of the truth at least,—and see, hereafter, if any 
darker truths will blot these pages. We have now been full two years 
united—the `romance' of our attachment must be worn away. Surely I 
have now got down to the lowest gradation in Arthur's affection, and 
discovered all the evils of his nature: if there be any further 
change, it must be for the better, as we become still more 
accustomed to each other: surely we shall find no lower depth than 
this. And, If so' I can bear it well—as well, at least, as I have 
borne it hitherto. 
</p>
               <p>Arthur is not what is commonly called a <hi>bad</hi> man: he has many 
good qualities; but he is a man without self-restraint or lofty 
aspirations—a lover of pleasure, given up to animal enjoyments: he 
is not a bad husband, but his notions of matrimonial duties and 
comforts are not my notions. Judging from appearances, his idea of a 
wife is a thing to love one devotedly and to stay at home—to wait 
upon her husband, and amuse him and minister to his comfort in every 
possible way, while he chooses to stay with her; and, when he is 
absent, to attend to his interests, domestic or otherwise, and 
patiently wait his return; no matter how be may be occupied in the 
meantime. 
</p>
               <p>Early in spring, be announced his intention of going to London: his 
affairs there demanded his attendance, he said, and he could refuse 
it no longer. He expressed his regret at having to leave me, but 
hoped I would amuse myself with the baby till he returned. 
</p>
               <p>`But why leave me?' I said. `I can go with you: I can be beady at 
any time.' 
</p>
               <p>`You would not take that child to town?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes—why not?' 
</p>
               <p>The thing was absurd: the air of the town would be certain to 
disagree with him, and with me as a nurse: the late hours and London 
habits would not suit me under such circumstances; and altogether he 
assured me that it would be excessively trouble some, injurious, and 
unsafe. I overruled his objections as well as I could, for I 
trembled at the thought of his going alone, and would sacrifice 
almost anything for myself, much even for my child, to prevent it; 
but at length he told me, plainly, and some what testily, that he 
could not do with me: he was worn out with the baby's restless 
nights, and must have some repose. I proposed separate apartments; 
but it would not do. 
</p>
               <p>`The truth is, Arthur,' I said, at last, `you are weary of my 
company, and determined not to have me with you. You might as well 
have said so at once.' 
</p>
               <p>He denied it; but I immediately left the room, and flew to the 
nursery to hide my feelings, if I could not sooth them, there. 
</p>
               <p>I was too much hurt to express any further dissatisfaction with his 
plans, or at all to refer to the subject again, except for the 
necessary arrangements concerning his departure and the conduct of 
affairs during his absence,—till the day before he went, when I 
earnestly exhorted him to take care of himself and keep out of the 
way of temptation. He laughed at my anxiety, but assured me there 
was no cause for it, and promised to attend to my advice, 
</p>
               <p>`I suppose it is no use asking you to fix a day for your return?' 
said I. 
</p>
               <p>`Why, no: I hardly can, under the circumstances; but be assured, 
love, I shall not be long away.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't wish to keep you a prisoner at home,' I replied: `I should 
not grumble at your staying whole months away—if you can be happy 
so long without me—provided I knew you were safe; but I don't like 
the idea of your being there, among your friends, as you call 
them.' 
</p>
               <p>`Pooh, pooh, you silly girl! Do you think I can't take care of 
myself?' 
</p>
               <p>`You didn't last time.—But THIS time, Arthur,' I added, earnestly, 
`show me that you can, and teach me that I need not fear to trust 
you!' 
</p>
               <p>He promised fair, but in such a manner as we seek to soothe a child. 
And did he keep his promise? No;—and, henceforth, I <hi>can 
never</hi> trust <hi>his word</hi>. Bitter, bitter confession! Tears 
blind me while I write. It was early in March that he went, and he 
did not return till July. This time, he did not trouble himself to 
make excuses as before, and his letters were less frequent, and 
shorter and less affectionate, especially after the first few weeks: 
they came slower and slower, and more terse and careless every time. 
But still, when <hi>I</hi> omitted writing he complained of my 
neglect. When I wrote sternly and coldly, as I confess I frequently 
did at the last, he blamed my harshness, and said it was enough to 
scare hung from his home: when I tried mild persuasion, he was a 
little more gentle in his replies, and promised to return; but I had 
learned, at last, to disregard his promises. 
</p>
               <p>Those were four miserable months, alternating between intense 
anxiety, despair, and indignation; pity for him, and pity for 
myself. And yet, through all, I was not wholly comfortless; I had my 
darling, sinless, inoffensive little one to console me, but even 
this consolation was embittered by the constantly recurring thought, 
`How shall I teach him, hereafter, to respect his father, and yet to 
avoid his example?' 
</p>
               <p>But I remembered that I had brought all these afflictions, in a 
manner wilfully, upon myself; and I determined to bear them without 
a murmur. At the same time I resolved not to give myself up to 
misery for the transgressions of another, and endeavoured to divert 
myself as much as I could; and besides the companionship of my child 
and my dear, faithful Rachel, who evidently guessed my sorrows and 
felt for them, though she was too discreet to allude to them,—I had 
my books and pencil, my domestic affairs, and the welfare and 
comfort of Arthur's poor tenants and labourers to attend to; and I 
sometimes sought and obtained amusement in the company of my young 
friend Esther Hargrave: occasionally, I rode over to see her, and 
once or twice I had her to spend the day with me at the manor. Mrs 
Hargrave did not visit London that season: having no daughter to 
marry, she thought it as well to stay at home and economize; and, 
for a wonder, Walter came down to join her in the beginning of June 
and stayed till near the close of August. 
</p>
               <p>The first time I saw him was on a sweet, warm evening, when I was 
sauntering in the park with little Arthur and Rachel, who is 
head-nurse and lady's-maid in one—for, with my secluded life and 
tolerably active habits, I require but little attendance, and as she 
had nursed me and coveted to nurse my child, and was moreover so 
very trustworthy, I preferred committing the important charge to 
her, with a young nurserymaid under her directions, to engaging 
anyone else:—besides it saves money; and since I have made 
acquaintance with Arthur's affairs, I have learned to regard that as 
no trifling recommendation; for, by my own desire, nearly the whole 
of the income of my fortune is devoted, for years to come, to the 
paying off of his debts, and the money he contrives to squander away 
in London is incomprehensible.—But to return to Mr Hargrave:—I was 
standing with Rachel beside the water, amusing the laughing baby in 
her arms with a twig of willow laden with golden catkins, when 
greatly to my surprise, he entered the park, mounted on his costly 
black hunter, and crossed over the grass to meet me. He saluted me 
with a very fine compliment, delicately worded, and modestly 
delivered withal, which he had doubtless concocted as he rode along. 
He told me he had brought a message from his mother, who, as he was 
riding that way, had desired him to call at the manor and beg the 
pleasure of my company to a friendly, family dinner to-morrow. 
</p>
               <p>`There is no one to meet but ourselves,' said he; `but Esther is 
very anxious to see you; and my mother fears you will feel solitary 
in this great house so much alone, and wishes she could persuade you 
to give her the pleasure of your company more frequently, and make 
yourself at home in our more humble dwelling, till Mr Huntingdon's 
return shall render this a little more conducive to your 
comfort.' 
</p>
               <p>`She is very kind,' I answered, `but I am not alone, you see;—and 
those whose time is fully occupied seldom complain of solitude.' 
</p>
               <p>`Will you not come tomorrow, then? She will be sadly disappointed if 
you refuse,' 
</p>
               <p>I did not relish being thus compassionated for my loneliness; but 
however, I promised to come. 
</p>
               <p>`What a sweet evening this is!' observed he, looking round upon the 
sunny park, with its imposing swell and slope, its placid water, and 
majestic clumps of trees. `And what a paradise you live in!' 
</p>
               <p>`It is a lovely evening,' answered I; and I sighed to think how 
little I had felt its loveliness, and how little of a paradise sweet 
Grass-dale was to me—how still less to the voluntary exile from its 
scenes. Whether Mr Hargrave divined my thoughts, I cannot tell, but, 
with a half-hesitating, sympathizing seriousness of tone and manner, 
he asked if I had lately heard from Mr Huntingdon. 
</p>
               <p>`Not lately,' I replied. 
</p>
               <p>`I thought not,' he muttered, as if to himself, looking thoughtfully 
on the ground. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you not lately returned from London?' I asked. 
</p>
               <p>`Only yesterday.' 
</p>
               <p>`And did you see him there?' 
</p>
               <p>`Was he well?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes—that is,' said he, with increasing hesitation and an 
appearance of suppressed indignation, `he was as well as—as he 
deserved to be, but under circumstances I should have deemed 
incredible for a man so favoured as he is.' He here looked up and 
pointed the sentence with a serious bow to me, I suppose my face was 
crimson. 
</p>
               <p>`Pardon me, Mrs Huntingdon,' he continued, `but I cannot sup press 
my indignation when I behold such infatuated blindness and 
perversion of taste;—but, perhaps you are not aware—`'He 
paused, 
</p>
               <p>`I am aware of nothing, sir—except that he delays his coming longer 
than I expected; and if at present, he prefers the society of his 
friends to that of his wife, and the dissipations of the town to the 
quiet of country life, I suppose I have those friends to thank for 
it. <hi>Their</hi> tastes and occupations are similar to his, and I 
don't see why his conduct should awaken either their indignation or 
surprise.' 
</p>
               <p>`You wrong me cruelly,' answered he: `I have shared but little of Mr 
Huntingdon's society, for the last few weeks; and as for his tastes 
and occupations, they are quite beyond me—lonely wanderer as I am. 
Where I have but sipped and tasted, he drains the cup to the dregs; 
and if ever for a moment I have sought to drown the voice of 
reflection in madness and folly, or if I have wasted too much of my 
time and talents among reckless and dissipated companions, God knows 
I would gladly renounce the entirely and for ever, if I had but 
<hi>half</hi> the blessings that man so thanklessly casts behind his 
back—but <hi>half</hi> the inducements to virtue and domestic, 
orderly habits that he despises—but <hi>such</hi> a home, and such a 
partner to share it!—It is infamous!' he muttered, between his 
teeth. `And don't think, Mrs Huntingdon,' he added, aloud, `that I 
could be guilty of inciting him to persevere in his present 
pursuits: on the contrary, I have remonstrated with him again and 
again; I have frequently expressed my surprise at his conduct and 
reminded him of his duties and his privileges—but to no purpose; he 
only—`' 
</p>
               <p>`Enough, Mr Hargrave; you ought to be aware that whatever my 
husband's faults may be, it can only aggravate the evil for me to 
hear them from a stranger's lips.' 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>Am</hi> I then a stranger?' said he, in a sorrowful tone. `I am 
your nearest neighbour, your son's godfather, and your husband's 
friend: may I not be your's also?' 
</p>
               <p>`Intimate acquaintance must precede real friendship: I know but 
little of you, Mr Hargrave, except from report.' 
</p>
               <p>`Have you then forgotten the six or seven weeks I spent under your 
roof last autumn? I have not forgotten them. And I know enough of 
<hi>you</hi>, Mrs Huntingdon, to think that your husband is the most 
enviable man in the world, and I should be the next if you would 
deem me worthy of your friendship.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you knew more of me, you would not think it-or if you did, you 
would not say it, and expect me to be flattered by the 
compliment.' 
</p>
               <p>I stepped backward as I spoke. He saw that I wished the conversation 
to end; and immediately taking the hint, he gravely bowed, wished me 
good evening, and turned his horse towards the road. He appeared 
grieved and hurt at my unkind reception of his sympathizing 
overtures. I was not sure that I had done right in speaking so 
harshly to him; but at the time, I had felt irritated—almost 
insulted—by his conduct; it seemed as if he was prig upon the 
absence and neglect of my husband, and insinuating even more than 
the truth against him. 
</p>
               <p>Rachel had moved on, during our conversation, to some yards' 
distance, He rode up to her, and asked to see the child, He took it 
carefully into his arms, looked upon it with an almost paternal 
smile, and I heard him say, as I approached— 
</p>
               <p>`And this, too, he has forsaken!' 
</p>
               <p>He then tenderly kissed it, and restored it to the gratified 
nurse. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you fond of children, Mr Hargrave?' said I, a little softened 
towards him. 
</p>
               <p>`Not in general,' he replied; `but that is such a <hi>sweet</hi>
child—and so like its mother,' he added, in a lower tone. 
</p>
               <p>`You are mistaken there; it is its father it resembles.' 
</p>
               <p>`Am I not right, nurse?' said he, appealing to Rachel. 
</p>
               <p>`I think, sir, there's a bit of both,' she replied, 
</p>
               <p>He departed; and Rachel pronounced him a very nice gentle man. I had 
still my doubts on the subject. 
</p>
               <p>When I met him on the morrow, under his own roof, he did not offend 
me with any more of his virtuous indignation against Arthur or 
unwelcome sympathy for me; and, indeed, when his mother began, in 
guarded terms, to intimate her sorrow and surprise at my husband's 
conduct, he, perceiving my annoyance, instantly came to the rescue, 
and delicately turned the conversation, at the same time warning 
her, by a sidelong glance, not to recur to the subject again. He 
seemed bent upon doing the honours of his house in the most 
unexceptionable manner, and exerting all his powers for the 
entertainment of his guest, and the display of his own 
qualifications as a host, a gentleman, and a companion; and actually 
succeeded in making himself very agreeable—only that he was too 
polite.—And yet, Mr Hargrave, I don't much like you; there is a 
certain want of openness about you that does not take my fancy, and 
a lurking selfishness, at the bottom of all your fine qualities, 
that I do not intend to lose sight of. No; for, instead of combating 
my slight prejudice against you as uncharitable, I mean to cherish 
it, until I am convinced that I have no reason to distrust this 
kind, insinuating friendship you are so anxious to push upon me. 
</p>
               <p>In the course of the following six weeks, I met him several times, 
but always, save once, in company with his mother or his sister, or 
both. When I called upon them, he always happened to be at home, and 
when they called on me, it was always he that drove them over in the 
phaeton. His mother, evidently, was quite delighted with his dutiful 
attentions and newly-acquired domestic habits. 
</p>
               <p>The time that I met him alone was on a bright but not oppressively 
hot day in the beginning of July: I had taken little Arthur into the 
wood that skirts the park, and there seated him on the 
moss-cushioned roots of an old oak; and, having gathered a hand full 
of bluebells and wild roses, I was kneeling before him, and 
presenting them, one by one, to the grasp of his tiny fingers; 
enjoying the heavenly beauty of the flowers, through the medium of 
his smiling eyes; forgetting, for the moment, all my cares, laughing 
at his gleeful laughter, and delighting myself with his 
delight,—when a shadow suddenly eclipsed the little space of 
sunshine on the grass before us; and, looking up, I beheld Walter 
Hargrave standing and gazing upon us. 
</p>
               <p>`Excuse me, Mrs Huntingdon,' said he, `but I was spellbound; I had 
neither the power to come forward and interrupt you, nor to withdraw 
from the contemplation of such a scene.—How vigorous my little 
godson grows! and how merry he is this morning.' He approached the 
child and stooped to take his hand; but, on seeing that his caresses 
were likely to produce tears and lamentations instead of a 
reciprocation of friendly demonstrations, he prudently drew back. 
</p>
               <p>`What a pleasure and comfort that little creature must be to you, 
Mrs Huntingdon!' he observed, with a touch of sadness in his 
intonation, as he admiringly contemplated the infant. 
</p>
               <p>`It is,' replied I; and then I asked after his mother and sister. 
</p>
               <p>He politely answered my enquiries, and then returned again to the 
subject I wished to avoid; though with a degree of timidity that 
witnessed his fear to offend. 
</p>
               <p>`You have not heard from Huntingdon lately?' he said. 
</p>
               <p>`Not this week,' I replied,—Not these three weeks, I might have 
said. 
</p>
               <p>`I had a letter from him this morning. I wish it were such a one as 
I could show to his lady.' He half drew from his waistcoat pocket a 
letter with Arthur's still beloved hand on the address, scowled at 
it, and put it back again, adding—`But he tells me he is about to 
return next week.' 
</p>
               <p>`He tells <hi>me</hi> so every time he writes.' 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed!—Well it is like him.—But to <hi>me</hi> he always avowed it 
his intention to stay till the present month.' 
</p>
               <p>It struck me like a blow, this proof of premeditated transgression 
and systematic disregard of truth. 
</p>
               <p>`It is only of a piece with the rest of his conduct,' observed Mr 
Hargrave, thoughtfully regarding me, and reading, I suppose, my 
feelings in my face. 
</p>
               <p>`Then he is really coming next week?' said I, after a pause. 
</p>
               <p>`You may rely upon it—if the assurance can give you any 
pleasure.—And is it <hi>possible</hi>, Mrs Huntingdon, that you can 
rejoice at his return?' he exclaimed, attentively perusing my 
features again. 
</p>
               <p>`Of course, Mr Hargrave; is he not my husband?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Huntingdon, you know not <hi>what</hi> you slight!' he 
passionately murmured. 
</p>
               <p>I took up my baby and, wishing him good morning, departed, to 
indulge my thoughts unscrutinized, within the sanctum of my home. 
</p>
               <p>And <hi>was</hi> I glad?—Yes, delighted;—though I was angered by 
Arthur's conduct, and though I felt that he had wronged me, and was 
determined he should feel it too.

               <head>Domestic Scenes</head>
               <p>ON the following morning, I received a few lines from him my self, 
confirming Hargrave's intimations respecting his approaching return. 
And he did come next week, but in a condition of body and mind even 
worse than before. I did not, however, intend to pass over his 
derelictions this time without a remark;—I found it would not do. 
But the first day, he was weary with his journey, and I was glad to 
get him back: I would not upbraid him then; I would wait till 
tomorrow. Next morning, he was weary still: I would wait a little 
longer. But at dinner, when, after break fasting at twelve o'clock 
on a bottle of soda-water and a cup of strong coffee, and lunching 
at two on another bottle of soda water mingled with brandy, he was 
finding fault with everything on the table and declaring we must 
change our cook—I thought the time was come. 
</p>
               <p>`It is the same cook as we had before you went, Arthur,' said I. You 
were generally pretty well satisfied with her then.' 
</p>
               <p>`You must have been letting her get into slovenly habits then, while 
I was away. It is enough to poison one—eating such a disgusting 
mess!' And he pettishly pushed away his plate, and leant back 
despairingly in his chair. 
</p>
               <p>`I think it is you that are changed, not she,' said I, but with the 
utmost gentleness, for I did not wish to irritate him. 
</p>
               <p>`It may be so,' he replied, carelessly, as he seized a tumbler of 
wine and water, adding, when he had tossed it off—`for I have an 
infernal fire in my veins, that all the waters of the ocean cannot 
quench!' 
</p>
               <p>`What kindled it?' I was about to ask, but at that moment the butler 
entered and began to take away the things. 
</p>
               <p>`Be quick, Benson—do have done with that infernal clatter!' cried 
his master—`And don't bring the cheese!—unless you want to make me 
sick outright.' 
</p>
               <p>Benson in some surprise, removed the cheese, and did his best to 
effect a quiet and speedy clearance of the rest, but, unfortunately, 
there was a rumple in the carpet, caused by the hasty pushing back 
of his master's chair, at which he tripped and stumbled, causing a 
rather alarming concussion with the trayful of crockery in his 
hands, but no positive damage, save the fall and breaking of a 
sauce-tureen;—but, to my unspeakable shame and dismay, Arthur 
turned furiously around upon him, and swore at him with savage 
coarseness. The poor man turned pale, and visibly trembled as he 
stooped to pick up the fragments. 
</p>
               <p>`He couldn't help it, Arthur,' said I; `the carpet caught his 
foot—and there's no great harm done. Never mind the pieces now, 
Benson, you can clear them away afterwards.' 
</p>
               <p>Glad to be released, Benson expeditiously set out the dessert and 
withdrew. 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>could</hi> you mean, Helen, by `taking the servant's part 
against me,' said Arthur, as soon as the door was closed, `when you 
knew I was distracted?' 
</p>
               <p>`I did not know you were distracted, Arthur, and the poor man was 
quite frightened and hurt at your sudden explosion.' 
</p>
               <p>`Poor man indeed! and do you think I could stop to consider the 
feelings of an insensate brute like that, when my own nerves were 
racked and torn to pieces by his confounded blunders?' 
</p>
               <p> `I never heard you complain of your nerves before.' 
</p>
               <p>`And why shouldn't I have nerves as well as you?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I don't dispute your claim to their possession, but I never 
complain of mine.' 
</p>
               <p>`No—how should you, when you never do anything to try them?' 
</p>
               <p>`Then why do you try yours, Arthur?' 
</p>
               <p>`Do you think I have nothing to do but to stay at home and take care 
of myself like a woman?' 
</p>
               <p>`Is it impossible then, to take care of yourself like a man when you 
go abroad? You told me that you could—and would too; and you 
promised—` 
</p>
               <p>`Come, come, Helen, don't begin with that nonsense now; I can't bear 
it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Can't bear what?—to be reminded of the promises you have 
broken?' 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, you are cruel. If you knew how my heart throbbed, and how 
every nerve thrilled through me while you spoke, you would spare me. 
You can pity a dolt of a servant for breaking a dish; but you have 
no compassion for me, when my head is split in two and all on fire 
with this consuming fever.' 
</p>
               <p>He leant his head on his hand, and sighed. I went to him and put my 
hand on his forehead. It was burning indeed. 
</p>
               <p>`Then come with me into the drawing-room, Arthur; and don't take any 
more wine; you have taken several glasses since dinner, and eaten 
next to nothing all the day. How can that make you better?' 
</p>
               <p>With some coaxing and persuasion, I got him to leave the table. When 
the baby was brought I tried to amuse him with that; but poor little 
Arthur was cutting his teeth, and his father could not bear his 
complaints; sentence of immediate banishment was passed upon him on 
the first indication of fretfulness; and, because, in the course of 
the evening, I went to share his exile for a little while, I was 
reproached, on my return, for preferring my child to my husband. I 
found the latter reclining on the sofa just as I had left him. 
</p>
               <p>`Well!' exclaimed the injured man, in a tone of pseudo resignation. 
`I thought I wouldn't send for you; I thought I'd just see—how long 
it would please you to leave me alone.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`I have not been very long, have I, Arthur? I have not been an hour, 
I'm sure.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, of course, an hour is nothing to you, so pleasantly employed; 
but to <hi>me</hi>—` 
</p>
               <p>`It has not been pleasantly employed,' interrupted I. `I have been 
nursing our poor little baby, who is very far from well, and I could 
not leave him till I got him to sleep.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh to be sure, you're overflowing with kindness and pity for 
everything but me.' 
</p>
               <p>`And why should I pity you? what is the matter with you?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well! that passes everything! After all the wear and tear that I've 
had, when I come home sick and weary, longing for comfort, and 
expecting to find attention and kindness, at least, from my 
wife,—she calmly asks what is the matter with me!' 
</p>
               <p>`There is nothing the matter with you,' returned I, `except what you 
have wilfully brought upon yourself against my earnest exhortation 
and entreaty.' 
</p>
               <p>`Now, Helen,' said he, emphatically, half rising from his recumbent 
posture, `if you bother me with another word, I'll ring the bell and 
order six bottles of wine—and, by Heaven, I'll drink them dry 
before I stir from this place!' 
</p>
               <p>I said no more but sat down before the table and drew a book towards 
me, 
</p>
               <p>`Do let me have quietness at least!' continued he, `if you deny me 
every other comfort,' and sinking back into his former position, 
with an impatient expiration between a sigh and a groan, he 
languidly closed his eyes as if to sleep. 
</p>
               <p>What the book was, that lay open on the table before me, I cannot 
tell, for I never looked at it. With an elbow on each side of it, 
and my hands clasped before my eyes, I delivered myself up to silent 
weeping. But Arthur was not asleep: at the first slight sob, he 
raised his head and looked round, impatiently exclaiming— 
</p>
               <p>`What are you crying for, Helen? What the deuce is the matter 
now?' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm crying for you, Arthur,' I replied, speedily drying my tears; 
and starting up, I threw myself on my knees before him, and, 
clasping his nerveless hand between my own, continued: `Don't you 
know that you are a part of myself? And do you think you can injure 
and degrade yourself, and I not feel it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Degrade myself, Helen?' 
</p>
               <p>Yes, degrade! What have you been doing all this time?' 
</p>
               <p>`You'd better not ask,' said he, with a faint smile. 
</p>
               <p>`And you had better not tell—but you cannot deny that you have 
degraded yourself miserably. You have shamefully wronged yourself, 
body and soul—and me too; and I can't endure it quietly—and I 
won't!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, don't squeeze my hand so frantically and don't agitate me so, 
for Heaven's sake! Oh, Hattersley! you were right; this woman will 
be the death of me, with her keen feelings and her interesting force 
of character—There, there, do spare me a little.' 
</p>
               <p>`Arthur, you must repent!' cried I, in a frenzy of desperation, 
throwing my arms around him and burying my face in his bosom. You 
shall say you are sorry for what you have done!' 
</p>
               <p> `Well, well, I am.' 
</p>
               <p>`You are not! you'll do it again.' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall never live to do it again, if you treat me so savagely,' 
replied he, pushing me from him. `You've nearly squeezed the breath 
out of my body.' He pressed his hand to his heart, and looked really 
agitated and ill. 
</p>
               <p>`Now get me a glass of wine,' said he, `to remedy what you've done, 
you she-tiger! I'm almost ready to faint.' 
</p>
               <p>I flew to get the required remedy It seemed to revive him 
considerably. 
</p>
               <p>`What a shame it is,' said I, as I took the empty glass from his 
hand, `for a strong young man like you to reduce yourself to such a 
state!' 
</p>
               <p>`If you knew all, my girl, you'd say rather, “What a wonder it is 
you can bear it so well as you do!” I've lived more in these four 
months, Helen, than you have in the whole course of your existence, 
or will to the end of your days, if they numbered a hundred 
years;—so I must expect to pay for it in some shape.' 
</p>
               <p>`You will have to pay a higher price than you anticipate, if you 
don't take care—there will be the total loss of your own health, 
and of my affection too—if that is of any value to you.' 
</p>
               <p>`What, you're at that game of threatening me with the loss of your 
affection again, are you? I think it couldn't have been very genuine 
stuff to begin with, if it's so easily demolished. If you don't 
mind, my pretty tyrant, you'll make me regret my choice in good 
earnest, and envy my friend Hattersley his meek little wife—she's 
quite a pattern to her sex, Helen; he had her with him in London all 
the season, and she was no trouble at all. He might amuse himself 
just as he pleased, in regular bachelor style, and she never 
complained of neglect; he might come home at any hour of the night 
or morning, or not come home at all; be sullen sober, or glorious 
drunk; and play the fool or the madman to his own heart's desire 
without any fear or botheration. She never gives him a word of 
reproach or complaint, do what he will. He says there's not such a 
jewel in all England, and swears he wouldn't take a kingdom for 
her,' 
</p>
               <p>`But he makes her life a curse to her.' 
</p>
               <p>`Not he! She has no will but his, and is always contented and happy 
as long as he is enjoying himself,' 
</p>
               <p>`In that case, she is as great a fool as he is; but it is not so. I 
have several letters from her, expressing the greatest anxiety about 
his proceedings, and complaining that you incite him to commit those 
extravagances—one especially, in which she implores me to use my 
influence with you to get you away from London, and affirms that her 
husband never did such things before you came, and would certainly 
discontinue them as soon as you departed and left him to the 
guidance of his own good sense.' 
</p>
               <p>`The detestable little traitor! Give me the letter, and he shall see 
it as sure as I'm a living man.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, he shall not see it without her consent; but if he did, there 
is nothing there to anger him—nor in any of the others. She never 
speaks a word against him; it is only anxiety for him that she 
expresses. She only alludes to his conduct in the most delicate 
terms, and makes every excuse for him that she can possibly think 
of—and as for her own misery, I rather feel it than see it 
expressed in her letters.' 
</p>
               <p>`But she abuses me; and no doubt you helped her.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; I told her she overrated my influence with you, that I would 
gladly draw you away from the temptations of the town if I could, 
but had little hope of success, and that I thought she was wrong in 
supposing that you enticed Mr Hattersley or anyone else into error. 
I had, myself, held the contrary opinion at one time, but I now 
believed that you mutually corrupted each other; and, perhaps, if 
she used a little gentle, but serious remonstrance with her husband, 
it might be of some service, as though he was more roughhewn than 
mine, I believed he was of a less impenetrable material.' 
</p>
               <p>`And so that is the way you go on—heartening each other up to 
mutiny, and abusing each other's partners, and throwing out 
implications against your own, to the mutual gratification of 
both!' 
</p>
               <p>`According to your own account,' said I, `my evil counsel has had 
but little effect upon her, And as to abuse and aspersions, we are 
both of us far too deeply ashamed of the errors and vices of our 
other halves, to make them the common subject of our correspondence. 
Friends as we are, we would willingly keep your failings to 
ourselves—even from ourselves if we could, unless by knowing them 
we could deliver you from them.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, well! don't worry me about them: you'll never effect any good 
by that. Have patience with me, and bear with my languor and 
crossness a little while, till I get this cursed low fever out of my 
veins, and then you'll find me cheerful and kind as ever. Why can't 
you be gentle and good as you were last time?—I'm sure I was very 
grateful for it.' 
</p>
               <p>`And what good did your gratitude do? I deluded myself with the idea 
that you were ashamed of your transgressions, and hoped you would 
never repeat them again; but now, you have left me nothing to 
hope!' 
</p>
               <p>`My case is quite desperate, is it? A very blessed consideration, if 
it will only secure me from the pain and worry of my dear, anxious 
wife's efforts to convert me, and her from the toil and trouble of 
such exertions, and her sweet face and silver accents from the 
ruinous effects of the same. A burst of passion is a fine, rousing 
thing upon occasion, Helen, and a flood of tears is marvellously 
affecting, but, when indulged too often, they are both deuced plaguy 
things for spoiling one's beauty and tiring out one's friends.' 
</p>
               <p>Thenceforth, I restrained my tears and passions as much as I could. 
I spared him my exhortations and fruitless efforts at con version 
too, for I saw it was all in vain: God might awaken that heart 
supine and stupified with self-indulgence, and remove the film of 
sensual darkness from his eyes, but I could not. His in justice and 
ill humour towards his inferiors, who could not defend themselves, I 
still resented and withstood; but when I alone was their object, as 
was frequently the case, I endured it with calm forbearance, except 
at times when my temper, worn out by repeated annoyances, or stung 
to distraction by some new instance of irrationality, gave way in 
spite of myself, and exposed me to the imputations of fierceness, 
cruelty, and impatience. I attended care fully to his wants and 
amusements, but not, I own, with the same devoted fondness as 
before, because I could not feel it: besides, I had now another 
claimant on my time and care—my ailing infant, for whose sake I 
frequently braved and suffered the reproaches and complaInts of his 
unreasonably exacting father. 
</p>
               <p>But Arthur is not naturally a peevish or irritable man—so far from 
it that there was something almost ludicrous in the incongruity of 
this adventitious fretfulness and nervous irritability, rather 
calculated to excite laughter than anger, if it were not for the 
intensely painful considerations attendant upon those symptoms of a 
disordered frame,—and his temper gradually improved as his bodily 
health was restored, which was much sooner than would have been the 
case, but for my strenuous exertions; for there was still one thing 
about him that I did not give up in des pair, and one effort for his 
preservation that I would not remit. His appetite for the stimulus 
of wine had increased upon him, as I had too well foreseen. It was 
now something more to him than an accessary to social enjoyment: it 
was an important source of enjoyment in itself. In this time of 
weakness and depression he would have made it his medicine and 
support, his comforter, his recreation, and his friend,—and thereby 
sunk deeper and deeper—and bound himself down for ever in the 
bathos whereinto he had fallen. But I determined this should never 
be, as long as I had any influence left; and though I could not 
prevent him from taking more than was good for him, still, by 
incessant perseverance, by kindness and firmness and vigilance, by 
coaxing and daring and determination,—I succeeded in preserving him 
from absolute bondage to that detestable propensity, so insidious in 
its advances, so inexorable in its tyranny, so disastrous in its 
effects. 
</p>
               <p>And here, I must not forget that I am not a little indebted to his 
friend Mr Hargrave. About that time he frequently called at 
Grass-dale, and often dined with us, on which occasions, I fear, 
Arthur would willingly have cast prudence and decorum to the winds 
and made `a night of it,' as often as his friend would have 
consented to join him in that exalted pastime; and if the latter had 
chosen to comply, he might, in a night or two, have ruined the 
labour of weeks, and overthrown, with a touch, the frail bulwark it 
had cost me such trouble and toil to construct. I was so fearful of 
this at first, that I humbled myself to intimate to him in private 
my apprehensions of Arthur's proneness to these excesses, and to 
express a hope that he would not encourage it. He was pleased with 
this mark of confidence, and certainly did not betray it. On that 
and every subsequent occasion, his presence served rather as a check 
upon his host, than an incitement to further acts of in temperance; 
and he always succeeded in bringing him from the dining-room in good 
time and in tolerably good condition; for if Arthur disregarded such 
intimations, as `Well, I must not detain you from your lady,' or `We 
must not forget that Mrs Huntingdon is alone,' he would insist upon 
leaving the table himself, to join me, and his host, however 
unwillingly, was obliged to follow. 
</p>
               <p>Hence, I learned to welcome Mr Hargrave, as a real friend to the 
family, a harmless companion for Arthur, to cheer his spirits and 
preserve him from the tedium of absolute idleness and a total 
isolation from all society but mine, and a useful ally to me. I 
could not but feel grateful to him under such circumstances; and I 
did not scruple to acknowledge my obligation on the first convenient 
opportunity; yet, as I did so, my heart whispered all was not right, 
and brought a glow to my face, which he heightened by his steady, 
serious gaze, while, by his manner of receiving those 
acknowledgments, he more than doubled my misgivings. His high 
delight at being able to serve me was chastened by sympathy for me 
and commiseration for himself—about I know not what, for I would 
not stay to enquire or suffer him to unburden his sorrows to me. His 
sighs and intimations of suppressed affliction seemed to come from a 
full heart; but either he must contrive to retain them within it, or 
breathe them forth in other ears than mine: there was enough of 
confidence between us already. It seemed wrong that there should 
exist a secret understanding between my husband's friend and me, 
unknown to him, of which he was the object. But my afterthought was, 
`If it is wrong, surely Arthur's is the fault, not mine.' 
</p>
               <p>And indeed, I know not whether at the time, it was not for 
<hi>him</hi> rather than myself that I blushed; for, since he and I 
are one, I so identify myself with him, that I feel his degradation, 
his failings, and transgressions as my own; I blush for him, I fear 
for him; I repent for him, weep, pray, and feel for him as for 
myself; but I cannot act for him; and hence, I must be and I am 
debased, contaminated by the union, both in my own eyes, and in the 
actual truth, I am so determined to love him—so intensely anxious 
to excuse his errors, that I am continually dwellIng upon them, and 
labouring to extenuate the loosest of his principles and the worst 
of his practices, till I am familiarized with vice and almost a par 
taker in his sins. Things that formerly shocked and disgusted me, 
now seem only natural. I know them to be wrong, because reason and 
God's word declare them to be so; but I am gradually losing that 
instinctive horror and repulsion which was given me by nature, or 
instilled into me by the precepts and example of my aunt. Perhaps, 
then, I was too severe in my judgments, for I abhorred the sinner as 
well as the sin; now, I flatter myself I am more charitable and 
considerate; but am I not becoming more indifferent and insensate 
too? Fool that I was to dream that I had strength and purity enough 
to save myself and him! Such vain presumption would be rightly 
served, if I should perish with him in the gulf from which I sought 
to save him! Yet, God preserve me from it!—and him too. Yes, poor 
Arthur, I will still hope and pray for you; and though I write as if 
you were some abandoned wretch, past hope and past reprieve, it is 
only my anxious fears—my strong desires—that make me do so; one 
who loved you less would be less bitter—less dissatisfied. 
</p>
               <p>His conduct has, of late, been what the world calls irreproachable; 
but then I know Iris heart is still unchanged;—and I know that 
spring is approaching, and deeply dread the consequences. 
</p>
               <p>As he began to recover the tone and vigour of his exhausted frame, 
and with it something of his former impatience of retirement and 
repose, I suggested a short residence by the seaside, for his 
recreation and further restoration, and for the benefit of our 
little one as well. But no; watering-places were so intolerably 
dull—besides, he had been invited by one of his friends to spend a 
month or two in Scotland for the better recreation of grouse 
shooting and deer-stalking, and had promised to go. 
</p>
               <p>`Then you will leave me again, Arthur?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, dearest, but only to love you the better when I come back, and 
make up for all past offences and shortcomings; and you needn't fear 
me this time; there are no temptations on the mountains. And during 
my absence you may pay a visit to Staningley, if you like: your 
uncle and aunt have long been wanting us to go there, you know; but 
somehow, there's such a repulsion between the good lady and me, that 
I could never bring myself up to the scratch.' 
</p>
               <p>I was perfectly willing to avail myself of this permission, though 
not a little apprehensive of my aunt's questions and comments 
concerning my matrimonial experience, regarding which I had been 
very reserved in my letters, for I had not much that was pleasant to 
communicate. 
</p>
               <p>About the third week in August, Arthur set out for Scotland, and Mr 
Hargrave accompanied him thither, to my private satisfaction. 
Shortly after, I, with little Arthur and Rachel, went to Staningley, 
my dear old home, which, as well as my dear old friends its 
inhabitants, I saw again with mingled feelings of pleasure and pain 
so intimately blended that I could scarcely distinguish the one from 
the other, or tell to which to attribute the various tears, and 
smiles, and sighs awakened by those old familiar scenes, and tones, 
and faces. Not quite two years had passed since I had seen and heard 
them last; but it seemed a far, far longer time; and well it might, 
for how immeasurably changed was I! how many things had I not seen, 
and felt, and learned since then! My uncle, too, appeared 
perceptibly more aged and infirm, my aunt more sad and grave. I 
believe she thought I had repented of my rashness; though she did 
not openly express her conviction, or triumphantly remind me of her 
slighted counsels, as I had partly feared she would; but she 
observed me narrowly—more narrowly than I liked to be observed—and 
seemed to mistrust my cheerfulness and unduly mark each little 
indication of sadness or serious thought, to notice all my casual 
observations, and silently draw her own inferences from them; while, 
by a system of quiet cross-questioning renewed from time to time, 
she drew from me many things I should not otherwise have told her, 
and laying this and that together, obtained, I fear, a pretty clear 
conception of my husband's faults and my afflictions, though not of 
my remaining sources of comfort and hope, for though I endeavoured 
to impress her strongly with the notion of Arthur's redeeming 
qualities, of our mutual affection, and the many causes I had for 
thankfulness and self-congratulation, she received all such 
intimations coldly and calmly, as if mentally making her own 
deductions—which deductions, I am persuaded, were generally far 
beyond the truth; though I certainly did exaggerate a little in 
attempting to picture the bright side of my position. Was it pride 
that made me so extremely anxious to appear satisfied with my 
lot,—or merely a just determination to bear my sell-imposed burden 
alone, and preserve my best friend from the slightest participation 
in those sorrows from which she had striven so hard to save me? It 
might have been some thing of each, but I am sure the latter motive 
was predominant. 
</p>
               <p>I did not much prolong my visit, for, not only did I feel my aunt's 
relentless watchfulness and incredulity to be a restraint upon me, 
and a silent reproach that oppressed me more than she could well 
imagine, but I was sensible that my little Arthur was an annoyance 
to his uncle, though the latter wished him well, and no great 
amusement to his aunt, though an object of her earnest affection and 
anxious solicitude. 
</p>
               <p>Dear aunt! have you so tenderly reared me from infancy, so carefully 
guided and instructed me in childhood and youth? and could I give 
you no return but this—to disappoint your hopes, oppose your 
wishes, scorn your warnings and advice, and darken your latter years 
with anxious fears and sorrow for the sufferings you cannot 
relieve?—It almost broke my heart to think of it; and again and 
again I endeavoured to convince her that I was happy and contented 
with my lot; but her last words, as she embraced me and kissed the 
child in my arms, before I entered the carriage, were,— 
</p>
               <p>`Take care of your son, Helen, and there may be happy days in store 
for you, yet. How great a comfort and treasure he is to you now, I 
can well imagine; but if you spoil him to gratify your present 
feelings, it will be too late to repent it when your heart is 
broken.' 
</p>
               <p>Arthur did not come home till several weeks after my return to 
Grass-dale: but I did not feel so anxious about him now: to think of 
him engaged in active sports among the wild hills of Scotland was 
very different from knowing him to be immersed amid the corruptions 
and temptations of London. His letters, now, though neither long nor 
lover-like, were more regular than ever they had been before; and 
when he did return, to my great joy, instead of being worse than 
when he went, he was more cheerful and vigorous, and better in every 
respect. Since that time, I have had little cause to complain. He 
still has an unfortunate predilection for the pleasures of the 
table, against which I have to struggle and watch; but he has begun 
to notice his boy, and that is an increasing source of amusement to 
him within doors; while his fox-hunting and coursing are a 
sufficient occupation for him without, when the ground is not 
hardened by frost; so that he is not wholly dependant on me for 
entertainment. But it is now January: spring is approaching; and, I 
repeat, I dread the consequences of its arrival. That sweet season, 
I once so joyously welcomed as the time of hope and gladness, 
awakens, now, far other anticipations by its return.

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI</head>
               <head>SOCIAL VIRTUES</head>
               <p>March 20th, 1824. The dreaded time is come, and Arthur is gone, as I 
expected. This time he announced it his intention to make but a short 
stay in London, and pass over to the continent, where he should 
probably stay a few weeks; but I shall not expect him till after the 
lapse of many weeks: I now know that, with him, days signify weeks, and 
weeks months. 
</p>
               <p>I was to have accompanied him, but, a little before the time arranged 
for our departure, he allowed—and even urged me, with an appearance 
of wonderful self-sacrifice, to go and see my unfortunate father, who 
is very ill, and my brother, who is very unhappy in consequence of both 
the illness and its cause, and whom I had not seen since the day our 
child was christened, when he stood sponsor along with Mr. Hargrave and 
my aunt. Not willing to impose upon my husband's good-nature in thus 
allowing me to leave him, I made but a very short stay; but when I 
returned to Grassdale—he was gone. 
</p>
               <p>He left a note to explain his so hasty departure, pretending that some 
sudden emergency had demanded his immediate presence in London, and 
rendered it impossible to await my return; adding that I had better not 
trouble myself to follow him, as he intended to make such a short stay, 
that it would hardly be worth while; and as, of course, he could travel 
alone at less than half the expense than if I accompanied him, it would 
perhaps be better to defer the excursion to another year, when he 
should have got our affairs into a rather more settled state, as he was 
now endeavouring to do. 
</p>
               <p>Was it really so?—or was the whole a contrivance to ensure his going 
forth upon his pleasure-seeking excursion, without my presence to 
restrain him? It is painful to doubt the sincerity of those we love, 
but after so many proofs of falsity and utter disregard to principle 
how can I believe so improbable a story? 
</p>
               <p>I have this one source of consolation left:—he had told me some time 
previously, that if ever he went to London or Paris again, he should 
observe more moderation in his indulgences than before, lest he should 
destroy his capacity for enjoyment altogether: he had no ambition to 
live to a prodigious old age, but he should like to have his share of 
life, and above all, to relish its pleasures to the last—to which end, 
he found it necessary to economize, for already, he feared, he was not 
so handsome a fellow as he had been, and young as he was, he had lately 
detected some grey hairs among his beloved chestnut locks; he suspected 
he was getting a trifle fatter too, than was quite desirable—but that 
was with good living and idleness; and for the rest, he trusted he was 
as strong and hearty as ever: only there was no saying what 
<hi>another</hi> such a season of unlimited madness and devilment, as the 
last, might not do towards bringing him down. Yes; he said this to 
me—with unblushing effrontery, and that same blythe, roguish twinkle 
of the eyes I once so loved to see, and that low, joyous laugh it used 
to warm my heart to hear. 
</p>
               <p>Well! such considerations will doubtless have more weight with him than 
any that I could urge. We shall see what <hi>they</hi> can do towards his 
preservation, since no better hope remains. 
</p>
               <p>July 30th.—He returned about three weeks ago, rather better in health, 
certainly, than before, but still worse in temper. And yet, perhaps, 
I am wrong: it is <hi>I</hi> that am less patient and forbearing. I am 
tired out with his injustice, his selfishness and hopeless 
<hi>depravity</hi>—I wish a milder word would do—; I am no angel and 
my corruption rises against it. My poor father died last week: Arthur 
was vexed to hear of it, because he saw that I was shocked and grieved, 
and he feared the circumstance would mar his comfort. When I spoke of 
ordering my mourning, he exclaimed— 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I hate black! But however, I suppose you must wear it awhile, for 
form's sake; but I hope, Helen, you won't think it your bounden duty 
to compose your face and manners into conformity with your funereal 
garb. Why should you sigh and groan, and I be made uncomfortable 
because an old gentleman in —-hire, a perfect stranger to us both, has 
thought proper to drink himself to death?—There now, I declare you're 
crying! Well, it must be affectation.' 
</p>
               <p>He would not hear of my attending the funeral, or going for a day or 
two, to cheer poor Frederick's solitude. It was quite unnecessary, he 
said, and I was unreasonable to wish it. What was my father to me? I 
had never seen him, but once since I was a baby, and I well knew he had 
never cared a stiver about me;—and my brother too, was little better 
than a stranger. `Besides, dear Helen,' said he, embracing me with 
flattering fondness, `I cannot spare you for a single day.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then how have you managed without me, these <hi>many</hi> days?' said 
I. 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! then I was knocking about the world, now I am at home; and home 
without you, my household deity, would be intolerable.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, as long as I am necessary to your comfort; but you did not say 
so before, when you urged me to leave you, in order that you might get 
away from your home without me,' retorted I; but before the words were 
well out of my mouth, I regretted having uttered them. It seemed so 
heavy a charge: if false, too gross an insult; if true, too humiliating 
a fact to be thus openly cast in his teeth. But I might have spared 
myself that momentary pang of self-reproach. The accusation awoke 
neither shame nor indignation in him: he attempted neither denial nor 
excuse, but only answered with a long, low, chuckling laugh as if he 
viewed the whole transaction as a clever, merry jest from beginning to 
end. Surely that man will make me dislike him at last! 
</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <l>“Sine as ye brew, my maiden fair, </l>
                     <l>Keep mind that ye maun drink the yill.” </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yes; and I <hi>will</hi> drink it to the very dregs: and none but myself 
shall know how bitter I find it! 
</p>
               <p>August 20th.—We are shaken down again to about our usual position. 
Arthur has returned to nearly his former condition and habits; and I 
have found it my wisest plan to shut my eyes against the past and 
future, as far as <hi>he</hi> at least is concerned, and live only for 
the present; to love him when I can; to smile (if possible) when he 
smiles, be cheerful when he is cheerful, and pleased when he is 
agreeable; and when he is not, to try to make him so—and if that won't 
answer, to bear with him, to excuse him, and forgive him, as well as 
I can, and restrain my own evil passions from aggravating his; and yet, 
while I thus yield and minister to his more harmless propensities to 
self-indulgence, to do all in my power to save him from the worse. 
</p>
               <p>But we shall not be long alone together. I shall shortly be called upon 
to entertain the same select body of friends as we had the autumn 
before last, with the addition of Mr. Hattersley and, at my special 
request, his wife and child. I long to see Milicent—and her little 
girl too. The latter is now above a year old; she will be a charming 
playmate for my little Arthur. 
</p>
               <p>September 30th.—Our guests have been here a week or two; but I have 
had no leisure to pass any comments upon them till now. I cannot get 
over my dislike to Lady Lowborough. It is not founded on mere personal 
pique; it is the woman herself that I dislike, because I so thoroughly 
disapprove of her. I always avoid her company as much as I can without 
violating the laws of hospitality; but when we do speak or converse 
together, it is with the utmost civility—even apparent cordiality on 
her part; but preserve me from such cordiality! It is like handling 
briar-roses and may-blossoms—bright enough to the eye, and outwardly 
soft to the touch, but you know there are thorns beneath, and every now 
and then you feel them too; and perhaps resent the injury by crushing 
them in till you have destroyed their power, though somewhat to the 
detriment of your own fingers. 
</p>
               <p>Of late, however, I have seen nothing in her conduct towards Arthur to 
anger or alarm me. During the first few days I thought she seemed very 
solicitous to win his admiration. Her efforts were not unnoticed by 
him: I frequently saw him smiling to himself at her artful manoeuvres: 
but, to his praise be it spoken, her shafts fell powerless by his side. 
Her most bewitching smiles, her haughtiest frowns were ever received 
with the same immutable, careless good-humour; till, finding he was 
indeed impenetrable, she suddenly remitted her efforts, and became, to 
all appearance, as perfectly indifferent as himself. Nor have I since 
witnessed any symptom of pique on his part, or renewed attempts at 
conquest upon hers. 
</p>
               <p>This is as it should be; but Arthur never will let me be satisfied with 
him. I have never, for a single hour since I married him, known what 
it is to realize that sweet idea, `In quietness and confidence shall 
be your rest.' Those two detestable men Grimsby and Hattersley have 
destroyed all my labour against his love of wine. They encourage him 
daily to overstep the bounds of moderation, and, not unfrequently, to 
disgrace himself by positive excess. I shall not soon forget the second 
night after their arrival. Just as I had retired from the dining-room, 
with the ladies, before the door was closed upon us, Arthur 
exclaimed— 
</p>
               <p>`Now then, my lads, what say you to a regular jollification?' 
</p>
               <p>Milicent glanced at me with a half reproachful look, as if <hi>I</hi>
could hinder it; but her countenance changed when she heard 
Hattersley's voice shouting through door and wall: 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>I'm</hi> your man! Send for more wine: here isn't <hi>half</hi>
enough!' 
</p>
               <p>We had scarcely entered the drawing-room before we were joined by Lord 
Lowborough. 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>can</hi> induce you to come so soon?' exclaimed his lady, with 
a most ungracious air of dissatisfaction. 
</p>
               <p>`You know I never drink, Annabella,' replied he, seriously. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but you might stay with them a little: it looks so silly to be 
always dangling after the women—I wonder you can!' 
</p>
               <p>He reproached her with a look of mingled bitterness and surprise, and 
sinking into a chair, suppressed a heavy sigh, bit his pale lips, and 
fixed his eyes upon the floor. 
</p>
               <p>`You did right to leave them, Lord Lowborough,' said I. `I trust you 
will always continue to honour us so early with your company. And if 
Annabella knew the value of true wisdom, and the misery of folly 
and—and intemperance, she would not talk such nonsense—even in 
jest.' 
</p>
               <p>He raised his eyes while I spoke, and gravely turned them upon me with 
a half surprised, half abstracted look, and then bent them on his 
wife. 
</p>
               <p>`At least,' said she, `I know the value of a warm heart and a bold, 
manly spirit!' 
</p>
               <p>And she pointed her words with a glance of triumph at me, which seemed 
to say, `And that is more than <hi>you</hi> do,' and a look of scorn at 
her husband, that entered into his soul. I was intensely exasperated; 
but it was not for me to reprove her, or, as it seemed, to express my 
sympathy with her husband without insulting his feelings. All I could 
do, to obey my inward impulse, was to hand him a cup of coffee, 
bringing it to him myself, and before I served either of the ladies, 
by way of balancing her contempt by my exceeding deference. He took it 
mechanically from my hand, with a slight inclination, and, next minute, 
rose and placed it untasted on the table, looking, not at it, but at 
her. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Annabella,' said he, in a deep and hollow tone, `since my 
presence is disagreeable to you, I will relieve you of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you going back to them, then?' said she, carelessly. 
</p>
               <p>`No,' exclaimed he, with harsh and startling emphasis; `I will NOT go 
back to them! And I will never stay with them one moment longer than 
I think right, for you or any other tempter! But you needn't mind that 
I shall never trouble you again, by intruding my company upon you so 
unseasonably.' 
</p>
               <p>He left the room, I heard the hall door open and shut, and immediately 
after, on putting aside the curtain, I saw him pacing down the park, 
in the comfortless gloom of the damp, cloudy twilight. 
</p>
               <p>Such scenes as this are always disagreeable to witness. Our little 
party was completely silenced for a moment. Milicent played with her 
teaspoon, and looked confounded and uncomfortable. If Annabella felt 
any shame or uneasiness, she attempted to hide it by a short, reckless 
laugh, and calmly betook herself to her coffee. 
</p>
               <p>`It would serve you right, Annabella,' said I at length, `if Lord 
Lowborough were to return to his old habits, which had so nearly 
effected his ruin, and which it cost him such an effort to break. You 
would then see cause to repent such conduct as this.' 
</p>
               <p>`Not at all, my dear! I should not mind if his Lordship were to see fit 
to intoxicate himself every day: I should only the sooner be rid of 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Annabella!' cried Milicent. `How <hi>can</hi> you say such wicked 
things! It would indeed be a just punishment, as far as you are 
concerned, if Providence should take you at your word, and make you 
feel what others feel that—' She paused as a sudden burst of loud 
talking and laughter reached us from the dining room, in which the 
voice of Hattersley was pre-eminently conspicuous, even to my 
unpractised ear. 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>you</hi> feel at this moment, I suppose?' said Lady Lowborough, 
with a malicious smile, fixing her eyes upon her cousin's distressed 
countenance. 
</p>
               <p>The latter offered no reply, but averted her face and brushed away a 
tear. At that moment the door opened and admitted Mr. Hargrave; just 
a little flushed, his dark eyes sparkling with unwonted vivacity. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I'm glad you're come, Walter!' cried his sister— `But I wish you 
could have got Ralph to come too.' 
</p>
               <p>`Utterly impossible, dear Milicent,' replied he, gaily. `I had much ado 
to get away myself. Ralph attempted to keep me by violence; Huntingdon 
threatened me with the eternal loss of his friendship; and Grimsby, 
worse than all, endeavoured to make me ashamed of my virtue, by such 
galling sarcasms and innuendos as he knew would wound me the most. So 
you see, ladies, you ought to make me welcome when I have braved and 
suffered so much for the favour of your sweet society.' He smilingly 
turned to me and bowed as he finished the sentence. 
</p>
               <p>`Isn't he <hi>handsome</hi> now Helen?' whispered Milicent, her sisterly 
pride overcoming, for the moment, all other considerations. 
</p>
               <p>`He would be,' I returned, `if that brilliance of eye, and lip, and 
cheek were natural to him; but look again, a few hours hence.' 
</p>
               <p>Here the gentleman took a seat near me at the table, and petitioned for 
a cup of coffee. 
</p>
               <p>`I consider this an apt illustration of Heaven taken by storm,' said 
he, as I handed one to him. `I am in paradise now; but I have fought 
my way through flood and fire to win it. Ralph Hattersley's last 
resource was to set his back against the door, and swear I should find 
no passage but through his body (a pretty substantial one too). 
Happily, however, that was not the only door, and I effected my escape 
by the side entrance, through the butler's pantry, to the infinite 
amazement of Benson, who was cleaning the plate.' 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Hargrave laughed, and so did his cousin; but his sister and I 
remained silent and grave. 
</p>
               <p>`Pardon my levity, Mrs. Huntingdon,' murmured he, more seriously, as 
he raised his eyes to my face. `You are not used to these things: you 
suffer them to affect your delicate mind too sensibly. But I thought 
of you in the midst of those lawless roisterers; and I endeavoured to 
persuade Mr. Huntingdon to think of you too; but to no purpose: I fear 
he is fully determined to enjoy himself this night; and it will be no 
use keeping the coffee waiting for him or his companions: it will be 
much if they join us at tea. Meantime, I earnestly wish I could banish 
the thoughts of them from your mind—and my own too, for I hate to 
think of them—yes—even of my dear friend Huntingdon, when I consider 
the power he possesses over the happiness of one so immeasurably 
superior to himself, and the use he makes of it—I positively 
<hi>detest</hi> the man!' 
</p>
               <p>`You had better not say so to me, then,' said I; `for, bad as he is, 
he is part of myself,' and you cannot abuse him without offending 
me.' 
</p>
               <p>`Pardon me, then, for I would sooner die than offend you.—But let us 
say no more of him for the present if you please.' 
</p>
               <p>He then entirely changed the subject of discourse, and exerting all his 
powers to entertain our little circle, conversed on different topics 
with more than his usual brilliance and fluency, addressing himself, 
sometimes, exclusively to me, sometimes to the whole trio of ladies. 
Annabella cheerfully bore her part in the conversation; but I was sick 
at heart,—especially when loud bursts of laughter and incoherent 
songs, pealing through the triple doors of hall and ante-room, startled 
my ear and pierced my aching temples;—and Milicent partly shared my 
feelings; so that, to us, the evening appeared a very long one, in 
spite of Hargrave's apparently good-natured exertions to give it a 
contrary effect. 
</p>
               <p>At last, they came; but not till after ten, when tea, which had been 
delayed for more than half an hour, was nearly over. Much as I had 
longed for their coming, my heart failed me at the riotous uproar of 
their approach; and Milicent turned pale and almost started from her 
seat as Mr. Hattersley burst into the room with a clamorous volley of 
oaths in his mouth, which Hargrave endeavoured to check by entreating 
him to remember the ladies. 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! you do well to remind me of the ladies, you dastardly deserter,' 
cried he, shaking his formidable fist at his brother-in-law; `if it 
were not for them, you well know, I'd demolish you in the twinkling of 
an eye, and give your body to the fowls of Heaven and the lilies of the 
field!” Then, planting a chair by Lady Lowborough's side, he stationed 
himself in it, and began to talk to her, with a mixture of absurdity 
and rascally impudence that seemed rather to amuse than to offend her; 
though she affected to resent his insolence, and to keep him at bay 
with sallies of smart and spirited repartee. 
</p>
               <p>Meantime, Mr. Grimsby seated himself by me, in the chair vacated by 
Hargrave as they entered, and gravely stated that he would thank me for 
a cup of tea: and Arthur placed himself beside poor Milicent, 
confidentially pushing his head into her face, and drawing in closer 
to her as she shrunk away from him. He was not so noisy as Hattersley, 
but his face was exceedingly flushed, he laughed incessantly, and while 
I blushed for all I saw and heard of him, I was glad that he chose to 
talk to his companion in so low a tone that no one could hear what he 
said but herself. It must have been intolerable nonsense at best, for 
she looked excessively annoyed, and first went red in the face, then 
indignantly pushed back her chair, and finally took refuge behind me 
on the sofa. Arthur's sole intention seemed to have been to produce 
some such disagreeable effects: he laughed immoderately on finding he 
had driven her away—drawing in his chair to the table, he leant his 
folded arms upon it, and delivered himself up to a paroxysm of weak, 
low, foolish laughter. When he was tired of this exercise he lifted his 
head and called aloud to Hattersley, and there ensued a clamorous 
contest between them about I know not what. 
</p>
               <p>`What fools they are!' drawled Mr. Grimsby, who had been talking away, 
at my elbow, with sententious gravity all the time; but I had been too 
much absorbed in contemplating the deplorable state of the other 
two—specially Arthur—to attend to him. 
</p>
               <p>`Did you ever hear such nonsense as they talk, Mrs. Huntingdon?' he 
continued. `I'm quite ashamed of them for my part: they can't take so 
much as a bottle between them without its getting into their 
heads—' 
</p>
               <p>`You are pouring the cream into your saucer, Mr. Grimsby.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! yes, I see, but we're almost in darkness here. Hargrave, snuff 
those candles, will you?' 
</p>
               <p>`They're wax; they don't require snuffing,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`”The light of the body is the eye,”' observed Hargrave, with a 
sarcastic smile. `”If thine eye be <hi>single</hi> thy whole body shall 
be full of light.”' 
</p>
               <p>Grimsby repulsed him with a solemn wave of the hand, and then, turning 
to me, continued, with the same drawling tones, and strange uncertainty 
of utterance and heavy gravity of aspect as before, `But as I was 
saying, Mrs. Huntingdon,—they have no head at all: they can't take 
half a bottle without being affected some way; whereas I—well, I've 
taken three times as much as they have to-night, and you see I'm 
perfectly steady. Now that may strike you as very singular, but I think 
I can explain it:—you see <hi>their</hi> brains—I mention no names, but 
you'll understand to whom I allude—their brains are light to begin 
with, and the fumes of the fermented liquor render them lighter still, 
and produce an entire light-headedness, or giddiness, resulting in 
intoxication; whereas <hi>my</hi> brains being composed of more solid 
materials will absorb a considerable quantity of this alcoholic vapour 
without the production of any sensible result—' 
</p>
               <p>`I think you will find a sensible result produced on that tea,' 
interrupted Mr. Hargrave, `by the quantity of sugar you have put into 
it. Instead of your usual complement of one lump you have put in 
six.' 
</p>
               <p>`Have I so?' replied the philosopher, diving with his spoon into the 
cup and bringing up several half-dissolved pieces in confirmation of 
the assertion. `Um! I perceive. Thus, Madam, you see the evil of 
absence of mind—of thinking too much while engaged in the common 
concerns of life. Now if I had my wits about me, like ordinary men, 
instead of within me like a philosopher, I should not have spoiled this 
cup of tea, and been constrained to trouble you for another.—With your 
permission, I'll turn this into the slop-basin.' 
</p>
               <p>`That is the sugar-basin, Mr. Grimsby. Now you have spoiled the sugar 
too; and I'll thank you to ring for some more—for here is Lord 
Lowborough, at last; and I hope his lordship will condescend to sit 
down with us, such as we are, and allow me to give him some tea. 
</p>
               <p>His lordship gravely bowed in answer to my appeal, but said nothing. 
Meantime, Hargrave volunteered to ring for the sugar, while Grimsby 
lamented his mistake, and attempted to prove that it was owing to the 
shadow of the urn and the badness of the lights. 
</p>
               <p>Lord Lowborough had entered a minute or two before, unobserved by any 
one but me, and been standing before the door, grimly surveying the 
company. He now stepped up to Annabella, who sat with her back towards 
him, with Hattersley still beside her, though not now attending to her, 
being occupied in vociferously abusing and bullying his host. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, Annabella,' said her husband, as he leant over the back of her 
chair, `which of these three “bold, manly spirits” would you have me 
to resemble?' 
</p>
               <p>`By Heaven and earth, you shall resemble us all!' cried Hattersley, 
starting up and rudely seizing him by the arm. `Hallo Huntingdon!' he 
shouted— `I've got him! Come, man, and help me! And d—n me body and 
soul if I don't make him blind drunk before I let him go! He shall make 
up for all past delinquencies as sure as I'm a living soul!' 
</p>
               <p>There followed a disgraceful contest; Lord Lowborough, in desperate 
earnest, and pale with anger, silently struggling to release himself 
from the powerful madman that was striving to drag him from the room. 
I attempted to urge Arthur to interfere in behalf of his outraged 
guest, but he could do nothing but laugh. 
</p>
               <p>`Huntingdon, you fool, come and help me, can't you!' cried Hattersley, 
himself somewhat weakened by his excesses. 
</p>
               <p>`I'm wishing you God-speed, Hattersley,' cried Arthur, `and aiding you 
with my prayers: I can't do anything else if my life depended on it! 
I'm quite used up. Oh, ho!' and leaning back in his seat, he clapped 
his hands on his sides and groaned aloud. 
</p>
               <p>`Annabella, give me a candle!' said Lowborough whose antagonist had now 
got him round the waist and was endeavouring to root him from the 
door-post to which he madly clung with all the energy of 
desperation. 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>I</hi> shall take no part in your rude sports!' replied the lady, 
coldly drawing back, `I wonder you can expect it.' 
</p>
               <p>But I snatched up a candle and brought it to him. He took it and held 
the flame to Hattersley's hands till, roaring like a wild beast, the 
latter unclasped them and let him go. He vanished, I suppose to his own 
apartment, for nothing more was seen of him till the morning. Swearing 
and cursing like a maniac, Hattersley threw himself on to the ottoman 
beside the window. The door being now free, Milicent attempted to make 
her escape from the scene of her husband's disgrace; but he called her 
back, and insisted upon her coming to him. 
</p>
               <p>`What do you want Ralph?' murmured she, reluctantly approaching him. 
</p>
               <p>`I want to know what's the matter with you,' said he, pulling her on 
to his knee like a child. `What are you crying for Milicent?—Tell 
me!' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm not crying.' 
</p>
               <p>`You are,' persisted he, rudely pulling her hands from her face. `How 
dare you tell such a lie?' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm not crying now,' pleaded she. 
</p>
               <p>`But you have been—and just this minute too; and I <hi>will</hi> know 
what for. Come now, you <hi>shall</hi> tell me!' 
</p>
               <p>`Do let me alone Ralph! remember we are not at home.' 
</p>
               <p>`No matter: you <hi>shall</hi> answer my question!' exclaimed her 
tormentor; and he attempted to extort the confession by shaking her and 
remorselessly crushing her slight arms in the gripe of his powerful 
fingers. 
</p>
               <p>`Don't let him treat your sister in that way,' said I to Mr. 
Hargrave. 
</p>
               <p>`Come now, Hattersley, I can't allow that,' said that gentleman, 
stepping up to the ill-assorted couple. `You let my sister alone, if 
you please.' And he made an effort to unclasp the ruffian's fingers 
from her arm, but was suddenly driven backward and nearly laid upon the 
floor by a violent blow in the chest accompanied with the 
admonition, 
</p>
               <p>`Take that for your insolence!—and learn not to interfere between me 
and mine again.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you were not beastly drunk, I'd have satisfaction for that!' gasped 
Hargrave, white and breathless as much from passion as from the 
immediate effects of the blow. 
</p>
               <p>`Go to the devil!' responded his brother-in-law. `Now Milicent, tell 
me what you were crying for.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'll tell you some other time,' murmured she, `when we are alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`Tell me now!' said he with another shake and a squeeze that made her 
draw in her breath and bite her lip to suppress a cry of pain. 
</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>`I'll</hi> tell you, Mr. Hattersley,' said I. `She was crying from 
pure shame and humiliation for you; because she could not bear to see 
you conduct yourself so disgracefully.' 
</p>
               <p>`Confound you, Madam!' muttered he, with a stare of stupid amazement 
at my `impudence.' `It was <hi>not</hi> that—was it Milicent?' 
</p>
               <p>She was silent. 
</p>
               <p>`Come, speak up child!' 
</p>
               <p>`I can't tell now,' sobbed she. 
</p>
               <p>`But you can say “yes” or “no” as well as “I can't tell—come!' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes,' she whispered, hanging her head and blushing at the awful 
acknowledgement. 
</p>
               <p>`Curse you for an impertinent huzzy then!' cried he, throwing her from 
him with such violence that she fell on her side; but she was up again 
before either I or her brother could come to her assistance, and made 
the best of her way out of the room and, I suppose, up stairs, without 
loss of time. 
</p>
               <p>The next object of assault was Arthur, who sat opposite, and had no 
doubt richly enjoyed the whole scene. 
</p>
               <p>`Now Huntingdon,' exclaimed his irascible friend, `I WILL NOT have you 
sitting there and laughing like an idiot!' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, Hattersley!' cried he, wiping his swimming eyes—`you'll be the 
death of me.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes I will, but not as you suppose: I'll have the heart out of your 
body, man, if you irritate me with any more of that imbecile laughter! 
What! are you at it yet?—There! see if that'll settle you!' cried 
Hattersley, snatching up a footstool and hurling it at the head of his 
host; but he missed his aim and the latter still sat collapsed and 
quaking with feeble laughter, with the tears running down his face; a 
deplorable spectacle indeed. Hattersley tried cursing and swearing, but 
it would not do; he then took a number of books from the table beside 
him and threw them, one by one, at the object of his wrath, but Arthur 
only laughed the more; and, finally, Hattersley rushed upon him in a 
phrensy, and, seizing him by the shoulders, gave him a violent shaking, 
under which he laughed and shrieked alarmingly. But I saw no more: I 
thought I had witnessed enough of my husband's degradation; and, 
leaving Annabella and the rest to follow when they pleased, I 
withdrew—but not to bed. Dismissing Rachel to her rest, I walked up 
and down my room, in an agony of misery, for what had been done, and 
suspense, not knowing what might further happen or how or when that 
unhappy creature would come up to bed. 
</p>
               <p>At last he came, slowly and stumblingly, ascending the stairs, 
supported by Grimsby and Hattersley, who neither of them walked quite 
steadily themselves, but were both laughing and joking at him, and 
making noise enough for all the servants to hear. He himself was no 
longer laughing now, but sick and stupid—I will write no more about 
<hi>that</hi>. 
</p>
               <p>Such disgraceful scenes (or nearly such) have been repeated more than 
once. I don't say much to Arthur about it, for if I did, it would do 
more harm than good; but I let him know that I intensely dislike such 
exhibitions; and each time he has promised they should never again be 
repeated; but I fear he is losing the little self-command and 
self-respect he once possessed: formerly, he would have been ashamed 
to act thus—at least, before any other witnesses than his boon 
companions, or such as they. His friend Hargrave, with a prudence and 
self-government that I envy for <hi>him</hi>, never disgraces himself by 
taking more than sufficient to render him a little `elevated,' and is 
always the first to leave the table, after Lord Lowborough, who, wiser 
still, perseveres in vacating the dining-room immediately after us; but 
never once, since Annabella offended him so deeply, has he entered the 
drawing-room before the rest; always spending the interim in the 
library, which I take care to have lighted for his accommodation—or, 
on fine moonlight nights, in roaming about the grounds. But I think she 
regrets her misconduct, for she has never repeated it since, and of 
late she has comported herself with wonderful propriety towards him, 
treating him with more uniform kindness and consideration than ever I 
have observed her to do before. I date the time of this improvement 
from the period when she ceased to hope and strive for Arthur's 
admiration.

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
               <head>COMPARISONS: INFORMATION REJECTED</head>
               <p>October 5th.—Esther Hargrave is getting a fine girl. She is not out of the 
school-room yet, but 
her mother frequently brings her over to call in the mornings when the 
gentlemen are out, and 
sometimes she spends an hour or two in company with her sister, and me, and 
the children; 
and when we go to the Grove, I always contrive to see her, and talk more to 
her than to any 
one else, for I am very much attached to my little friend, and so is she to 
me. I wonder what 
she can see to like in me though, for I am no longer the happy, lively girl I 
used to be; but 
she has no other society—save that of her uncongenial mother, and her 
governess (as artificial 
and conventional a person as that prudent mother could procure to rectify the 
pupil's natural 
qualities), and, now and then, her subdued, quiet sister. I often wonder what 
will be 
<hi>her</hi> lot in life—and so does she; but <hi>her</hi> speculations on the 
future are full of 
buoyant hope—so were mine once. I shudder to think of her being awakened 
like me to a 
sense of their delusive vanity. It seems as if I should feel her 
disappointment even more 
deeply than my own: I feel, almost, as if I were born for such a fate, but 
<hi>she</hi> is so 
joyous and fresh, so light of heart and free of spirit, and so guileless and 
unsuspecting 
too—oh, it would be cruel to make her feel as I feel now, and know what I 
have known! 
</p>
               <p>Her sister trembles for her too. Yesterday morning, one of October's 
brightest, loveliest days, 
Milicent and I were in the garden enjoying a brief half hour together with 
our children, while 
Annabella was lying on the drawing-room sofa, deep in the last new novel. We 
had been 
romping with the little creatures, almost as merry and wild as themselves, 
and now paused 
in the shade of the tall copper beech, to recover breath and rectify our 
hair, disordered by the 
rough play and the frolicsome breeze—while they toddled together along the 
broad, sunny 
walk; my Arthur supporting the feebler steps of her little Helen, and 
sagaciously pointing out 
to her the brightest beauties of the border as they passed, with 
semi-articulate prattle that did 
as well for her as any other mode of discourse. From laughing at the pretty 
sight, we began 
to talk of the children's future life; and that made us thoughtful. We both 
relapsed into silent 
musing as we slowly proceeded up the walk; and I suppose Milicent by a train 
of associations 
was led to think of her sister. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen,' said she, `you often see Esther, don't you?' 
</p>
               <p>`Not very often.' 
</p>
               <p>`But you have more frequent opportunities of meeting her than I have: and she 
loves you I 
know, and reverences you too: there is nobody's opinion she thinks so much 
of, and she says 
you have more sense than mamma.' 
</p>
               <p>`That is because she is self-willed, and my opinions more generally coincide 
with her own 
than your mamma's. But what then, Milicent?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, since you have so much influence with her, I wish you would seriously 
impress it upon 
her, never, on any account, or for any body's persuasion, to marry for the 
sake of money, or 
rank, or establishment, or any earthly thing, but true affection and 
well-grounded esteem.' 
</p>
               <p>`There is no necessity for that,' said I: `for we have had some discourse on 
that subject 
already, and I assure you her ideas of love and matrimony are as romantic as 
any one could 
desire.' 
</p>
               <p>`But romantic notions will not do: I want her to have true notions.' 
</p>
               <p>`Very right, but in my judgment, what the world stigmatizes as romantic, is 
often more nearly 
allied to the truth than is commonly supposed; for, if the generous ideas of 
youth are too 
often overclouded by the sordid views of after-life, that scarcely proves 
them to be false.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but if you think her ideas are what they ought to be, strengthen them, 
will you? and 
confirm them, as far as you can; for <hi>I</hi> had romantic notions once, 
and—I don't mean 
to say that I regret my lot, for I am quite sure I don't—but—' 
</p>
               <p>`I understand you,' said I; `you are contented for yourself, but you would 
not have your sister 
to suffer the same as you. 
</p>
               <p>`No—or worse. She might have far worse to suffer than I—for I <hi>am 
really</hi> contented, 
Helen, though you mayn't think it: I speak the solemn truth in saying that I 
would not 
exchange my husband for any man on earth, if I might do it by the plucking of 
this leaf.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I believe you: now that you have him, you would not exchange 
<hi>him</hi> for 
another; but then you would gladly exchange some of his qualities for those 
of better 
men. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; just as I would gladly exchange some of my own qualities for those of 
better women; 
for neither he nor I are perfect, and I desire his improvement as earnestly 
as my own. And 
he will improve—don't you think so Helen?—he's only six and twenty yet. 
</p>
               <p>`He may,' I answered. 
</p>
               <p>`He will—he WILL!' repeated she. 
</p>
               <p>`Excuse the faintness of my acquiescence, Milicent; I would not discourage 
your hopes for 
the world, but mine have been so often disappointed, that I am become as cold 
and doubtful 
in my expectations as the flattest of octogenarians.' 
</p>
               <p>`And yet you do hope, still—even for Mr. Huntingdon?' 
</p>
               <p>`I do, I confess—“even” for <hi>him;</hi> for it seems as if life and hope 
must cease together. 
And is he so <hi>much</hi> worse, Milicent, than Mr. Hattersley?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, to give you my candid opinion, I think there is no comparison between 
them. But you 
mustn't be offended, Helen, for you know I always speak my mind; and you may 
speak yours 
too; I shan't care.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am not offended, love; and <hi>my</hi> opinion is that if there <hi>be</hi> a 
comparison made 
between the two, the difference, for the most part, is certainly in 
Hattersley's favour.' 
</p>
               <p>Milicent's own heart told her how much it cost me to make this 
acknowledgement; and, with 
a childlike impulse, she expressed her sympathy by suddenly kissing my cheek, 
without a 
word of reply, and then turning quickly away caught up her baby, and hid her 
face in its 
frock. How odd it is that we so often weep for each other's distresses, when 
we shed not a 
tear for our own! Her heart had been full enough of her own sorrows, but it 
overflowed at 
the idea of mine;—and I too, shed tears at the sight of her sympathetic 
emotion, though I had 
not wept for myself for many a week. 
</p>
               <p>But Milicent's satisfaction in her choice, is not entirely feigned: she 
really loves her husband; 
and it is too true that he loses nothing by comparison with mine. Either he 
is less unbridled 
in his excesses, or owing to his stronger, hardier frame, they produce a much 
less deleterious 
effect upon him; for he never reduces himself to a state in any degree 
bordering on imbecility, 
and with him the worst effect of a night's debauch is a slight increase of 
irascibility, or it 
may be a season of sullen ferocity on the following morning: there is nothing 
of that lost, 
depressing appearance—that peevish, ignoble fretfulness, that wears one out 
with very shame 
for the transgressor. But then, it was not formerly so with Arthur: he can 
bear less now than 
he could at Hattersley's age; and if the latter does not reform, his powers 
of endurance may 
be equally impaired when he has tried them as long. He has five years the 
advantage of his 
friend, and his vices have not mastered him yet: he has not folded them to 
him and made 
them a part of himself. They seem to sit loose upon him, like a cloak that he 
could throw 
aside at any moment if he would—but how long will that option be left 
him?—Though a 
creature of passion and sense, regardless of the duties and the higher 
privileges of intelligent 
beings, he is no voluptuary: he prefers the more active and invigorating 
animal enjoyments, 
to those of a more relaxing, enervating kind. He does not make a 
<hi>science</hi> of the 
gratification of his appetites either in the pleasures of the table or 
anything else; he eats 
heartily what is set before him, without demeaning himself by any of that 
abandonment to 
the palate and the eye—that unbecoming particularity in approval or 
disapproval which it is 
so hateful to witness in those we would esteem. Arthur, I fear, would give 
himself up to 
luxury as the chief good, and might ultimately plunge into the grossest 
excesses, but for the 
fear of irremediably blunting his appetites, and destroying his powers of 
further enjoyment. 
For Hattersley, graceless ruffian as he is, I believe there is more 
reasonable ground of hope; 
and—far be it from me to blame poor Milicent for his delinquencies—but I do 
think that if she 
had the courage or the will to speak her mind about them, and maintain her 
point 
unflinchingly, there would be more chance of his reclamation, and he would be 
likely to treat 
her better, and love her more, in the end. I am partly led to think so by 
what he said to me 
himself, not many days ago—I purpose to give her a little advice on the 
subject some time; 
but still, I hesitate from the consciousness that her ideas and disposition 
are both against it, 
and if my counsels failed to do good, they would do harm by making her more 
unhappy. 
</p>
               <p>It was one rainy day last week: most of the company were killing time in the 
billiard-room, 
but Milicent and I were with little Arthur and Helen in the library, and 
between our books, 
our children, and each other, we expected to make out a very agreeable 
morning. We had not 
been thus secluded above two hours, however, when Mr. Hattersley came in 
attracted, I 
suppose, by the voice of his child as he was crossing the hall, for he is 
prodigiously fond of 
her, and she of him. 
</p>
               <p>He was redolent of the stables, where he had been regaling himself with the 
company of his 
fellow-creatures, the horses, ever since breakfast. But that was no matter to 
my little 
namesake: as soon as the colossal person of her father darkened the door, she 
uttered a shrill 
scream of delight, and, quitting her mother's side, ran crowing towards 
him—balancing her 
course with out-stretched arms,—and, embracing his knee, threw back her head 
and laughed 
in his face. He might well look smilingly down upon those small, fair 
features radiant with 
innocent mirth, those clear, blue, shining eyes, and that soft flaxen hair 
cast back upon the 
little ivory neck and shoulders. Did he not think how unworthy he was of such 
a possession? 
I fear no such idea crossed his mind. He caught her up, and there followed 
some minutes of 
very rough play, during which it is difficult to say whether the father or 
the daughter laughed 
and shouted the loudest. At length, however, the boisterous pastime 
terminated—suddenly, as 
might be expected: the little one was hurt and began to cry; and its ungentle 
playfellow tossed 
it into its mother's lap, bidding her `make all straight.' As happy to return 
to that gentle 
comforter as it had been to leave her, the child nestled in her arms and 
hushed its cries in a 
moment; and, sinking its little weary head on her bosom, soon dropped 
asleep. 
</p>
               <p>Meantime, Mr. Hattersley strode up to the fire, and, interposing his height 
and breadth 
between us and it, stood, with arms akimbo, expanding his chest, and gazing 
round him as 
if the house and all its appurtenances and contents were his own undisputed 
possessions. 
</p>
               <p>`Deuced bad weather this!' he began. `There'll be no shooting to-day, I 
guess.' Then, 
suddenly lifting up his voice, he regaled us with a few bars of a rollicking 
song, which 
abruptly ceasing, he finished the tune with a whistle, and then continued,— 
`I say Mrs. 
Huntingdon, what a fine stud your husband has!—not large but good.—I've 
been looking at 
them a bit this morning; and upon my word, Black Bess, and Grey Tom, and that 
young 
Nimrod are the finest animals I've seen for many a day!' Then followed a 
particular 
discussion of their various merits, succeeded by a sketch of the great things 
<hi>he</hi>
intended to do in the horse-jockey line when his old governor thought proper 
to quit the 
stage.— `Not that I wish him to close his accounts, added he; `the old 
Trojan is welcome to 
keep his books open as long as he pleases for me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope so, <hi>indeed</hi>, Mr. Hattersley!' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh yes! It's only my way of talking. The event must come, sometime, and so I 
look to the 
bright side of it—that's the right plan, isn't it, Mrs. H.?—What are you 
two doing here, by the 
by—where's Lady Lowborough?' 
</p>
               <p>`In the billiard room. 
</p>
               <p>`What a splendid creature she <hi>is</hi>!' continued he, fixing his eyes on 
his wife, who 
changed colour, and looked more and more disconcerted as he proceeded. `What 
a noble 
figure she has! and what magnificent black eyes; and what a fine spirit of 
her own;—and what 
a tongue of her own, too, when she likes to use it—I perfectly adore 
her!—But never mind, 
Milicent; I wouldn't have her for my wife—not if she'd a kingdom for her 
dowry! I'm better 
satisfied with the one I have.—Now, <hi>then</hi>! what do you look so sulky 
for? don't you 
believe me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, I believe you,' murmured she, in a tone of half sad, half sullen 
resignation, as she 
turned away to stroke the hair of her sleeping infant, that she had laid on 
the sofa beside 
her. 
</p>
               <p>`Well <hi>then,</hi> what makes you so cross? Come here Milly, and tell me why 
you can't 
be satisfied with my assurance.' 
</p>
               <p>She went, and, putting her little hand within his arm, looked up in his face, 
and said 
softly,— 
</p>
               <p>`What does it amount to Ralph? Only to this, that though you admire Annabella 
so much, and 
for qualities that I don't possess, you would still rather have me than her 
for your wife, which 
merely proves that you don't think it necessary to love your wife: you are 
satisfied if she can 
keep your house and take care of your child. But I'm not cross; I'm only 
sorry; for,' added 
she in a low, tremulous accent, withdrawing her hand from his arm, and 
bending her looks 
on the rug, `if you don't love me, you don't, and it can't be helped.' 
</p>
               <p>`Very true: but who told you I didn't? Did I say I loved Annabella?' 
</p>
               <p>`You said you adored her.' 
</p>
               <p>`True, but adoration isn't love. I adore Annabella, but I don't love her; and 
I love thee 
Milicent, but I don't adore thee.' In proof of his affection, he clutched a 
handful of her light 
brown ringlets and appeared to twist them unmercifully. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you really, Ralph?' murmured she with a faint smile beaming through her 
tears, just 
putting up her hand to his, in token that he pulled <hi>rather</hi> too 
hard. 
</p>
               <p>`To be sure I do,' responded he: `only you bother me rather, sometimes.' 
</p>
               <p>`I bother you!' cried she in very natural surprise. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, <hi>you</hi>—but only by your exceeding goodness—when a boy has been 
cramming 
raisins and sugar-plums all day, he longs for a squeeze of sour orange by way 
of a change. 
And did you never, Milly, observe the sands on the sea-shore; how nice and 
smooth they 
look, and how soft and easy they feel to the foot? But if you plod along, for 
half an hour, 
over this soft, easy carpet—giving way at every step, yielding the more the 
harder you 
press,—you'll find it rather wearisome work, and be glad enough to come to a 
bit of good, 
firm rock, that won't budge an inch whether you stand, walk, or stamp upon 
it; and, though 
it be hard as the nether millstone, you'll find it the easier footing after 
all.' 
</p>
               <p>`I know what you mean, Ralph,' said she, nervously playing with her 
watch-guard and tracing 
the figure on the rug with the point of her tiny foot, `I know what you mean, 
but I thought 
you always liked to be yielded to; and I can't alter now. 
</p>
               <p>`I do like it,' replied he, bringing her to him by another tug at her hair. 
`You mustn't mind 
my talk Milly. A man must have something to grumble about; and if he can't 
complain that 
his wife harries him to death with her perversity and ill-humour, he must 
complain that she 
wears him out with her kindness and gentleness.' 
</p>
               <p>`But why complain at all, unless, because you are tired and dissatisfied?' 
</p>
               <p>`To excuse my own failings, to be sure. Do you think I'll bear all the burden 
of my sins on 
my own shoulders, as long as there's another ready to help me, with none of 
her own to 
carry?' 
</p>
               <p>`There is no such one on earth,' said she seriously; and then, taking his 
hand from her head, 
she kissed it with an air of genuine devotion, and tripped away to the 
door. 
</p>
               <p>`What now?' said he. `Where are you going?' 
</p>
               <p>`To tidy my hair,' she answered, smiling through her disordered locks: 
`you've made it all 
come down.' 
</p>
               <p>`Off with you then!—An excellent little woman,' he remarked when she was 
gone, `but a 
thought too soft—she almost melts in one's hands. I positively think I 
ill-use her sometimes, 
when I've taken too much—but I can't help it, for she never complains, 
either at the time or 
after. I suppose she doesn't mind it.' 
</p>
               <p>`I can enlighten you on that subject, Mr. Hattersley,' said I: `she 
<hi>does</hi> mind it; and 
some other things she minds still more, which, yet, you may never hear her 
complain of.' 
</p>
               <p>`How do you know?—does she complain to you?' demanded he, with a sudden 
spark of fury 
ready to burst into a flame if I should answer `Yes.' 
</p>
               <p>`No,' I replied; `but I have known her longer and studied her more closely 
than you have 
done.—And I can tell you, Mr. Hattersley, that Milicent loves you more than 
you deserve, and 
that you have it in your power to make her very happy, instead of which you 
are her evil 
genius, and, I will venture to say, there is not a single day passes in which 
you do not inflict 
upon her some pang that you might spare her if you would.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well—it's not <hi>my</hi> fault,' said he, gazing carelessly up at the 
ceiling and plunging his 
hands into his pockets: `if my ongoings don't suit her, she should tell me 
so.' 
</p>
               <p>`Is she not exactly the wife you wanted? Did you not tell Mr. Huntingdon you 
must have one 
that would submit to anything without a murmur, and never blame you, whatever 
you 
did?' 
</p>
               <p>`True, but we shouldn't always have what we want: it spoils the best of us, 
doesn't it? How 
can I help playing the deuce when I see it's all one to her whether I behave 
like a Christian 
or like a scoundrel such as nature made me?—and how can I help teazing her 
when she's so 
invitingly meek and mim—when she lies down like a spaniel at my feet and 
never so much 
as squeaks to tell me that's enough?' 
</p>
               <p>`If you are a tyrant by nature, the temptation is strong, I allow; but no 
generous mind delights 
to oppress the weak, but rather to cherish and protect.' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>don't</hi> oppress her; but it's so confounded flat to be always 
cherishing and 
protecting;—and then how can I tell that I <hi>am </hi>oppressing her when she 
“melts away 
and makes no sign?”' I sometimes think she has no feeling at all; and then I 
go on till she 
cries—and that satisfies me. 
</p>
               <p>`Then you <hi>do</hi> delight to oppress her.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't, I tell you!—only when I'm in a bad humour—or a particularly good 
one, and want 
to afflict for the pleasure of comforting; or when she looks flat and wants 
shaking up a bit. 
And sometimes, she provokes me by crying for nothing, and won't tell me what 
it's for; and 
then, I allow, it enrages me past bearing—especially, when I'm not my own 
man.' 
</p>
               <p>`As is no doubt generally the case on such occasions,' said I. `But in 
future, Mr. Hattersley, 
when you see her looking flat or crying for “nothing” (as you call it), 
ascribe it all to 
yourself: be assured it is something you have done amiss, or your general 
misconduct that 
distresses her.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't believe it. If it were, she should tell me so: I don't like that way 
of moping and 
fretting in silence, and saying nothing—it's not honest. How can she expect 
me to mend my 
ways at that rate?' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps she gives you credit for having more sense than you possess, and 
deludes herself 
with the hope that you will one day see your own errors and repair them, if 
left to your own 
reflection.' 
</p>
               <p>`None of your sneers, Mrs. Huntingdon! I <hi>have</hi> the sense to see that 
I'm not always 
quite correct—but sometimes I think that's no great matter, as long as I 
injure nobody but 
myself—' 
</p>
               <p>`It <hi>is</hi> a great matter,' interrupted I, `both to yourself (as you will 
hereafter find to your 
cost) and to all connected with you—most especially your wife—but indeed, 
it is nonsense to 
talk about injuring no one but yourself, it is impossible to injure 
yourself—especially by such 
acts as we allude to—without injuring hundreds, if not thousands, besides, 
in a greater or less 
degree, either by the evil you do or the good you leave undone.' 
</p>
               <p>`And as I was saying,' continued he— `or would have said if you hadn't taken 
me up so 
short—I sometimes think I should do better if I were joined to one that 
would always remind 
me when I was wrong, and give me a motive for doing good and eschewing evil 
by decidedly 
showing her approval of the one, and disapproval of the other.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you had no higher motive than the approval of your fellow mortal, it 
would do you little 
good.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, but if I had a mate that would not always be yielding, and always 
equally kind, but 
that would have the spirit to stand at bay now and then, and honestly tell me 
her mind at all 
times—such a one as yourself for instance—now if I went on with you as I do 
with her when 
I'm in London, you'd make the house too hot to hold me at times, I'll be 
sworn. 
</p>
               <p>`You mistake me: I'm no termagant.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, all the better for that, for I can't stand contradiction—in a general 
way—and I'm as fond 
of my own will as another: only I think too much of it doesn't answer for any 
man. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I would never contradict you without a cause, but certainly I would 
always let you 
know what I thought of your conduct; and if you oppressed me, in body, mind, 
or estate, you 
should at least have no reason to suppose “I didn't mind it. 
</p>
               <p>`I know that my lady; and I think if my little wife were to follow the same 
plan it would be 
better for us both.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'll tell her.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, let her be; there's much to be said on both sides—and, now I think 
upon it, 
Huntingdon often regrets that you are not more like her—scoundrelly dog that 
he is—and you 
see, after all, you can't reform <hi>him:</hi> he's <hi>ten</hi> times worse than 
I.—He's afraid 
of you, to be sure—that is, he's always on his best behaviour in your 
presence—but—' 
</p>
               <p>`I wonder what his worst behaviour is like, then?' I could not forbear 
observing. 
</p>
               <p>`Why, to tell you the truth, it's very bad indeed isn't it, Hargrave?' said 
he, addressing that 
gentleman, who had entered the room unperceived by me, for I was now standing 
near the 
fire with my back to the door. `Isn't Huntingdon,' he continued, `as great a 
reprobate as ever 
was d—d?' 
</p>
               <p>`His lady will not hear him censured with impunity,' replied Mr. Hargrave, 
coming forward, 
`but I must say, I thank God I am not such another.' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps it would become you better,' said I, `to look at what you are, and 
say, “God be 
merciful to me a sinner.”' 
</p>
               <p>`You are severe,' returned he, bowing slightly and drawing himself up with a 
proud yet 
injured air. Hattersley laughed, and clapped him on the shoulder. Moving from 
under his hand 
with a gesture of insulted dignity, Mr. Hargrave took himself away to the 
other end of the 
rug. 
</p>
               <p>`Isn't it a shame, Mrs. Huntingdon?' cried his brother-in-law— `I struck 
Walter Hargrave 
when I was drunk, the second night after we came, and he's turned a cold 
shoulder on me 
ever since; though I asked his pardon the very morning after it was done!' 
</p>
               <p>`Your manner of asking it,' returned the other, `and the clearness with which 
you remembered 
the whole transaction, showed you were not too drunk to be fully conscious of 
what you were 
about, and quite responsible for the deed.' 
</p>
               <p>`You wanted to interfere between me and my wife,' grumbled Hattersley, `and 
that is enough 
to provoke any man. 
</p>
               <p>`You justify it then?' said his opponent, darting upon him a most vindictive 
glance. 
</p>
               <p>`No, I tell you I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been under excitement; 
and if you choose 
to bear malice for it, after all the handsome things I've said—do so and be 
damned!' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>would</hi> refrain from such language in a <hi>lady's</hi> presence, at 
least,' said Mr. 
Hargrave, hiding his anger under a mask of disgust. 
</p>
               <p>`What have I said?' returned Hattersley. `Nothing but Heaven's truth—he will 
be damned, 
won't he, Mrs. Huntingdon, if he doesn't forgive his brother's 
trespasses?' 
</p>
               <p>`You ought to forgive him, Mr. Hargrave, since he asks you,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you say so? Then I will!' And, smiling almost frankly, he stepped forward 
and offered 
his hand. It was immediately clasped in that of his relative, and the 
reconciliation was 
apparently cordial on both sides. 
</p>
               <p>`The affront,' continued Hargrave, turning to me, `owed half its bitterness 
to the fact of its 
being offered in your presence; and since you bid me forgive it, I will—and 
forget it too.' 
</p>
               <p>`I guess the best return I can make, will be to take myself off,' muttered 
Hattersley, with a 
broad grin. His companion smiled; and he left the room. This put me on my 
guard. Mr. 
Hargrave turned seriously to me, and earnestly began— 
</p>
               <p>`Dear Mrs. Huntingdon, how I have longed for, yet dreaded this hour! Do not 
be alarmed,' 
he added, for my face was crimson with anger; `I am not about to offend you 
with any 
useless entreaties or complaints. I am not going to presume to trouble you 
with the mention 
of my own feelings or your perfections, but I have something to reveal to you 
which you 
ought to know, and which, yet, it pains me inexpressibly—' 
</p>
               <p>`Then don't trouble yourself to reveal it!' 
</p>
               <p>`But it is of importance— 
</p>
               <p>`If so, I shall hear it soon enough—specially if it is bad news, as you seem 
to consider it. At 
present, I am going to take the children to the nursery. 
</p>
               <p>`But can't you ring, and send them?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; I want the exercise of a run to the top of the house.—Come Arthur.' 
</p>
               <p>`But you will return?' 
</p>
               <p>`Not yet; don't wait.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then, when may I see you again?' 
</p>
               <p>`At lunch,' said I, departing with little Helen in one arm, and leading 
Arthur by the hand. 
</p>
               <p>He turned away, muttering some sentence of impatient censure or complaint, in 
which 
`heartless' was the only distinguishable word. 
</p>
               <p>`What nonsense is this Mr. Hargrave?' said I, pausing in the doorway. `What 
do you 
mean?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, nothing—I did not intend you should hear my soliloquy. But the fact is, 
Mrs. 
Huntingdon, I have a disclosure to make—painful for me to offer as for you 
to hear—and I 
want you to give me a few minutes of your attention in private, at any time 
and place you 
like to appoint. It is from no selfish motive that I ask it, and not for any 
cause that could 
alarm your super-human purity; therefore, you need not kill me with that look 
of cold and 
pitiless disdain. I know too well the feelings with which the bearers of bad 
tidings are 
commonly regarded, not to—' 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>is</hi> this wonderful piece of intelligence?' said I, impatiently 
interrupting him. `If 
it is anything of real importance, speak it in three words before I go.' 
</p>
               <p>`In three words I cannot. Send those children away, and stay with me. 
</p>
               <p>`No; keep your bad tidings to yourself. I know it is some thing I don't want 
to hear, and 
something you would displease me by telling.' 
</p>
               <p>`You have divined too truly I fear; but still since I know it, I feel it my 
duty to disclose it to 
you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, spare us both the infliction—and I will exonerate you from the duty. 
You have offered 
to tell; I have refused to hear: my ignorance will not be charged on you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Be it so—you shall not hear it from me. But if the blow fall too suddenly 
upon you when it 
comes, remember—I wished to soften it!' 
</p>
               <p>I left him. I was determined his words should not alarm me. What could 
<hi>he</hi> of all 
men, have to reveal that was of importance for <hi>me</hi> to hear? It was no 
doubt some 
exaggerated tale about my unfortunate husband, that he wished to make the 
most of to serve 
his own bad purposes. 
</p>
               <p>6th. He has not alluded to this momentous mystery since; and I have seen no 
reason to repent 
of my unwillingness to hear it. The threatened blow has not been struck yet; 
and I do not 
greatly fear it. At present I am pleased with Arthur: he has not positively 
disgraced himself 
for upwards of a fortnight, and all this last week, has been so very moderate 
in his indulgence 
at table, that I can perceive a marked difference in his general temper and 
appearance. Dare 
I hope this will continue?

               <head>TWO EVENINGS</head>
               <p>Seventh. Yes, I <hi>will</hi> hope! To-night, I heard Grimsby and 
Hattersley grumbling together, about the inhospitality of their host. 
They did not know I was near, for I happened to be standing behind the 
curtain, in the bow of the window, watching the moon rising over the 
clump of tall, dark elm-trees below the lawn and wondering why Arthur 
was so sentimental as to stand without, leaning against the outer 
pillar of the portico, apparently watching it too. 
</p>
               <p>`So, I suppose we've seen the last of our merry carousals in this 
house,' said Mr. Hattersley, `I <hi>thought</hi> his good-fellowship 
wouldn't last long.—But,' added he, laughing, `I didn't expect it 
would meet its end this way. I rather thought our pretty hostess would 
be setting up her porcupine quills, and threatening to turn us out of 
the house, if we didn't mind our manners.' 
</p>
               <p>`You didn't foresee <hi>this,</hi> then?' answered Grimsby with a 
guttural chuckle. `But he'll change again when he's sick of her. If we 
come here a year or two hence, we shall have all our own way, you'll 
see.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't know,' replied the other: `she's not the style of woman 
you soon tire of—but be that as it may, it's devilish provoking now, 
that we can't be jolly, because he chooses to be on his good 
behaviour.' 
</p>
               <p>`It's all these cursed women!' muttered Grimsby. `They're the 
very bane of the world! They bring trouble and discomfort wherever they 
come, with their false, fair faces and their d—d deceitful tongues.' 
</p>
               <p>At this juncture, I issued from my retreat, and smiling on Mr. 
Grimsby as I passed, left the room and went out in search of Arthur. 
Having seen him bend his course towards the shrubbery, I followed him 
thither, and found him just entering the shadowy walk. I was so light 
of heart, so overflowing with affection, that I sprang upon him and 
clasped him in my arms. This startling conduct had a singular effect 
upon him: first, he murmured, `Bless you darling!' and returned my 
close embrace with a fervour like old times, and <hi>then</hi> he started, and 
in a tone of absolute terror, exclaimed 
</p>
               <p>`Helen!—What the devil is this!' and I saw, by the faint light 
gleaming through the overshadowing tree, that he was positively pale 
with the shock. 
</p>
               <p>How strange that the instinctive impulse of affection should come 
first, and then the shock of the surprise! It shows at least that the 
affection is genuine: he is not sick of me yet. 
</p>
               <p>`I startled you, Arthur,' said I, laughing in my glee. `How 
nervous you are!' 
</p>
               <p>`What the deuce did you do it for?' cried he, quite testily, 
extricating himself from my arms, and wiping his forehead with his 
handkerchief. `Go back, Helen—go back directly! You'll get your death 
of cold!' 
</p>
               <p>`I won't—till I've told you what I came for. They are blaming 
you, Arthur, for your temperance and sobriety, and I'm come to thank 
you for it. They say it is all “these cursed women,” and that we are 
the bane of the world; but don't let them laugh, or grumble you out of 
your good resolutions, or your affection for me.' 
</p>
               <p>He laughed. I squeezed him in my arms again, and cried in tearful 
earnest— 
</p>
               <p>`Duo persevere!—and I'll love you better than ever I did 
before!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, well, I will!' said he, hastily kissing me. `There now, 
go.—You mad creature, how <hi>could</hi> you come out in your light 
evening dress, this chill autumn night?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is a glorious night,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`It is a night that will give you your death, in another minute. 
Run away, do!' 
</p>
               <p>`Do you see my death among those trees, Arthur?' said I, for he 
was gazing intently at the shrubs, as if he saw it coming, and I was 
reluctant to leave him, in my new-found happiness and revival of hope 
and love. But he grew angry at my delay, so I kissed him and ran back 
to the house. 
</p>
               <p>I was in such a good humour that night: Milicent told me I was 
the life of the party, and whispered she had never seen me so 
brilliant. Certainly, I talked enough for twenty, and smiled upon them 
all. Grimsby, Hattersley, Hargrave, Lady Lowborough—all shared my sisterly 
kindness. 
Grimsby stared and 
wondered; Hattersley laughed and jested (in spite of the little wine 
he had been suffered to imbibe), but still, behaved as well as he knew 
how; Hargrave and Annabella, from different motives and in different 
ways emulated me, and doubtless both surpassed me, the former in his 
discursive versatility and eloquence, the latter in boldness and 
animation at least. Milicent, delighted to see her husband, her brother 
and her over-estimated friend acquitting themselves so well, was lively 
and gay too, in her quiet way. Even Lord Lowborough caught the general 
contagion: his dark, greenish eyes were lighted up beneath their moody 
brows; his sombre countenance was beautified by smiles; all traces of 
gloom, and proud or cold reserve had vanished for the time; and he 
astonished us all, not only by his general cheerfulness and animation, 
but by the positive flashes of true force and brilliance he emitted 
from time to time. Arthur did not talk much, but he laughed, and 
listened to the rest, and was in perfect good-humour, though not 
excited by wine. So that, altogether we made a very merry, innocent and 
entertaining party. 
</p>
               <p>9th. Yesterday, when Rachel came to dress me for dinner, I saw 
that she had been crying. I wanted to know the cause of it, but she 
seemed reluctant to tell. Was she unwell? No. Had she heard bad news 
from her friends? No. Had any of the servants vexed her? 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no Ma'am!' she answered.—'It's not for myself.' 
</p>
               <p>`What then, Rachel? Have you been reading novels?' 
</p>
               <p>`Bless you, no!' said she with a sorrowful shake of the head; and 
then she sighed and continued, `But to tell you the truth, Ma'am, I 
don't like master's ways of going on.' 
</p>
               <p>`What do you mean Rachel?—He's going on very properly— at 
present. 
</p>
               <p>`Well ma'am, if you think so, it's right.' 
</p>
               <p>And she went on dressing my hair, in a hurried way, quite unlike 
her usual calm, collected manner,—murmuring, half to herself, she was 
sure it was beautiful hair, she `could like to see em match it.' When 
it was done, she fondly stroked it and gently patted my head. 
</p>
               <p>`Is that affectionate ebullition intended for my hair, or myself, 
nurse?' said I, laughingly turning round upon her;—but a tear was even 
now in her eye. 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>do</hi> you mean, Rachel?' I exclaimed. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, ma'am, I don't know,—but if—' 
</p>
               <p>`If what?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, if I was you, I wouldn't have that Lady Lowborough in the 
house another minute—not another <hi>minute</hi> I wouldn't!' 
</p>
               <p>I was thunderstruck; but before I could recover from the shock 
sufficiently to demand an explanation, Milicent entered my rooms she 
frequently does, when she is dressed before me; and she stayed with me 
till it was time to go down. She must have found me a very unsociable 
companion this time, for Rachel's last words rung in my ears. But 
still, I hoped—I trusted they had no foundation but in some idle 
rumour of the servants from what they had seen in Lady Lowborough's 
manner last month; or, perhaps, from something that had passed between 
their master and her during her former visit. At dinner, I narrowly 
observed both her and Arthur, and saw nothing extraordinary in the 
conduct of either—nothing calculated to excite suspicion, except in 
distrustful minds—which mine was not, and therefore I would not 
suspect. 
</p>
               <p>Almost immediately after dinner, Annabella went out with her 
husband to share his moonlight ramble, for it was a splendid evening 
like the last. Mr. Hargrave entered the drawing-room a little before 
the others, and challenged me to a game of chess. He did it without any 
of that sad, but proud humility he usually assumes in addressing me, 
unless he is excited with wine. I looked at his face to see if that was 
the case now. His eye met mine keenly, but steadily: there was 
something about him I did not understand, but he seemed sober enough. 
Not choosing to engage with him, I referred him to Milicent. 
</p>
               <p>`She plays badly,' said he: `I want to match my skill with yours. 
Come now!—you can't pretend you are reluctant to lay down your work—I 
know you never take it up except to pass an idle hour, when there is 
nothing better you can do.' 
</p>
               <p>`But chess players are so unsociable,' I objected; `they are no 
company for any but themselves. 
</p>
               <p>`There is no one here—but Milicent, and she—' 
</p>
               <p> `Oh, I shall be delighted to watch you!' cried our mutual 
friend.— `Two <hi>such</hi> players—it will be quite a treat! I wonder 
which will conquer.' 
</p>
               <p>I consented. 
</p>
               <p>`Now Mrs. Huntingdon,' said Hargrave, as he arranged the men on 
the board, speaking distinctly, and with a peculiar emphasis as if he 
had a double meaning to all his words, `you are a good player,—but I 
am a better: we shall have a long game, and you will give me some 
trouble; but I can be as patient as you, and, in the end, I shall 
certainly win.' He fixed his eyes upon me with a glance I did not 
like—keen, crafty, bold, and almost impudent; already half triumphant 
in his anticipated success. 
</p>
               <p>`I hope not, Mr. Hargrave!' returned I, with a vehemence that 
must have startled Milicent at least; but <hi>he</hi> only smiled and 
murmured,— 
</p>
               <p>`Time will shew.' 
</p>
               <p>We set to work; he, sufficiently interested in the game, but calm 
and fearless in the consciousness of superior skill; I, intensely eager 
to disappoint his expectations, for I considered this the type of a 
more serious contests I imagined he did—and I felt an almost 
superstitious dread of being beaten: at all events, I could ill endure 
that present success should add one tittle to his conscious power (his 
insolent self-confidence, I ought to say), or encourage, for a moment, 
his dream of future conquest. His play was cautious and deep, but I 
struggled hard against him. For some time the combat was doubtful; at 
length, to my joy, the victory seemed inclining to my side: I had taken 
several of his best pieces, and manifestly baffled his projects. He put 
his hand to his brow and paused, in evident perplexity. I rejoiced in 
my advantage, but dared not glory in it yet. At length, he lifted his 
head, and, quietly making his move, looked at me and said, calmly,— 
</p>
               <p>`Now you think you will win, don't you.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope so,' replied I, taking his pawn, that he had pushed into 
the way of my bishop with so careless an air that I thought it was an 
oversight, but was not generous enough, under the circumstances, to 
direct his attention to it, and too heedless, at the moment, to foresee 
the after consequences of my move. 
</p>
               <p>`It is those bishops that trouble me,' said he; `but the bold 
knight can overleap the reverend gentleman,' taking my last bishop with 
his knight;—'and now, those sacred persons once removed, I shall carry 
all before me. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh Walter, how you talk!' cried Milicent.—'She has far more 
pieces than you still.' 
</p>
               <p>`I intend to give you some trouble yet,' said I; `and perhaps, 
sir, you will find yourself checkmated before you are aware. Look to 
your queen.' 
</p>
               <p>The combat deepened. The game <hi>was</hi> a long one, and I 
<hi>did</hi> give him some trouble: but he <hi>was</hi> a better player 
than I. 
</p>
               <p>`What keen gamesters you are!' said Mr. Hattersley, who had now 
entered, and been watching us for some time. `Why, Mrs. Huntingdon, 
your hand trembles as if you had staked your all upon it! and 
Walter—you dog—you look as deep and cool as if you were certain of 
success,—and as keen and cruel as if you would drain her heart's 
blood! But if I were you, I wouldn't beat her, for very fear: she'll 
hate you if you do—he will, by Heaven!—I see it in her eye.' 
</p>
               <p>`Hold your tongue, will you?' said I—his talk distracted me, for 
I was driven to extremities. A few more moves and I was inextricably 
entangled in the snare of my antagonist. 
</p>
               <p>`Check,'—cried he: I sought in agony some means of 
escape—`mate!' he added, quietly but with evident delight. He had 
suspended the utterance of that last fatal syllable the better to enjoy 
my dismay. I was foolishly disconcerted by the event. Hattersley 
laughed; Milicent was troubled to see me so disturbed. Hargrave placed 
his hand on mine that rested on the table, and squeezing it with a firm 
but gentle pressure, murmured `Beaten—beaten!' and gazed into my face 
with a look where exultation was blended with an expression of ardour 
and tenderness yet more insulting. 
</p>
               <p>`<hi>No, never</hi>, Mr. Hargrave!' exclaimed I, quickly 
withdrawing my hand. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you deny?' replied he, smilingly pointing to the board. 
</p>
               <p>`No, no,' I answered, recollecting how strange my conduct must 
appear; `you have beaten me in that game. 
</p>
               <p>`Will you try another, then?' 
</p>
               <p>`No.' 
</p>
               <p> `You acknowledge my superiority?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes—as a chess-player.' 
</p>
               <p>I rose to resume my work. 
</p>
               <p>`Where is Annabella?' said Hargrave, gravely, after glancing 
round the room. 
</p>
               <p>`Gone out with Lord Lowborough,' answered I, for he looked at me 
for a reply. 
</p>
               <p>`And not yet returned!' he said seriously. 
</p>
               <p>`I suppose not.' 
</p>
               <p>`Where is Huntingdon?' looking round again. 
</p>
               <p>`Gone out with Grimsby—as you know,' said Hattersley suppressing 
a laugh, which broke forth as he concluded the sentence. 
</p>
               <p>Why did he laugh? Why did Hargrave connect them thus together? 
Was it true, then?—And was this the dreadful secret he had wished to 
reveal to me? I must know—and that quickly. I instantly rose and left 
the room to go in search of Rachel, and demand an explanation of her 
words; but Mr. Hargrave followed me into the ante-room, and before I 
could open its outer door, gently laid his hand upon the lock. 
</p>
               <p>`May I tell you something, Mrs. Huntingdon?' said he, in a 
subdued tone, with serious, downcast eyes. 
</p>
               <p>`If it be anything worth hearing,' replied I, struggling to be 
composed, for I trembled in every limb. 
</p>
               <p>He quietly pushed a chair towards me. I merely leant my hand upon 
it, and bid him go on. 
</p>
               <p>`Do not be alarmed,' said he: `what I wish to say is nothing in 
itself, and I will leave you to draw your own inferences from it. You 
say that Annabella is not yet returned?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, yes—go on!' said I, impatiently, for I feared my forced 
calmness would leave me before the end of his disclosure, whatever it 
might be. 
</p>
               <p>`And you hear,' continued he, `that Huntingdon is gone out with 
Grimsby?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well?' 
</p>
               <p>`I heard the latter say to your husband—or the man who calls 
himself so—' 
</p>
               <p>`Go on, sir!' 
</p>
               <p>He bowed submissively, and continued, `I heard him say,— “I 
shall manage it, you'll see! They're gone down by the water; I shall 
meet them there, and tell him I want a bit of talk with him about some 
things that we needn't trouble the lady with; and she'll say she can 
be walking back to the house; and then I shall apologize, you know, and 
all that, and tip her a wink to take the way of the shrubbery. I'll 
keep him talking there, about those matters I mentioned, and anything 
else I can think of, as long as I can, and then bring him round the 
other way, stopping to look at the trees, the fields, and anything else 
I can find to discourse of.”' Mr. Hargrave paused, and looked at me. 
</p>
               <p>Without a word of comment or further questioning, I rose, and 
darted from the room and out of the house. The torment of suspense was 
not to be endured: I would not suspect my husband falsely, on this 
man's accusation, and I would not trust him unworthily—I must know the 
truth at once. I flew to the shrubbery. Scarcely had I reached it, when 
a sound of voices arrested my breathless speed. 
</p>
               <p>`We have lingered too long; he will be back,' said Lady 
Lowborough's voice. 
</p>
               <p>`Surely not, dearest!' was <hi>his</hi> reply, `but you can run 
across the lawn, and get in as quietly as you can: I'll follow in a 
while.' 
</p>
               <p>My knees trembled under me; my brain swam round: I was ready to 
faint. She must not see me thus. I shrunk among the bushes, and leant 
against the trunk of a tree to let her pass. 
</p>
               <p>`Ah, Huntingdon!' said she reproachfully, pausing where I had 
stood with him the night before— `it was here you kissed that woman!' 
She looked back into the leafy shade. Advancing thence, he answered, 
with a careless laugh— 
</p>
               <p>`Well, dearest, I couldn't help it. You know I must keep straight 
with her as long as I can. Haven't I seen you kiss your dolt of a 
husband, scores of times?—and do I ever complain?' 
</p>
               <p>`But tell me, don't you love her stills <hi>little</hi>?' said she 
placing her hand on his arm and looking earnestly in his face—for I 
could see them plainly, the moon shining full upon them from between 
the branches of the tree that sheltered me. 
</p>
               <p>`Not <hi>one bit</hi>, by all that's sacred!' he replied, kissing 
her glowing cheek. 
</p>
               <p> `Good Heavens, I <hi>must</hi> be gone!' cried she, suddenly 
breaking from him, and away she flew. 
</p>
               <p>There he stood before me; but I had not strength to confront him 
now; my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth,* I was well nigh 
sinking to the earth, and I almost wondered he did not hear the beating 
of my heart above the low sighing of the wind, and the fitful rustle 
of the falling leaves. My senses seemed to fail me, but still I saw his 
shadowy form pass before me, and through the rushing sound in my ears, 
I distinctly heard him say, as he stood looking up the lawn— 
</p>
               <p>`There goes the fool! Run Annabella, run! There—in with you! Ah, 
he didn't see! That's right Grimsby, keep him back!' And even his low 
laugh reached me as he walked away. 
</p>
               <p>`God help me now!' I murmured, sinking on my knees among the damp 
weeds and brushwood that surrounded me, and looking up at the moonlit 
sky, through the scant foliage above. It seemed all dim and quivering 
now to my darkened sight. My burning, bursting heart strove to pour 
forth its agony to God, but could not frame its anguish into prayer; 
until a gust of wind swept over me, which, while it scattered the dead 
leaves, like blighted hopes, around, cooled my forehead, and seemed a 
little to revive my sinking frame. Then, while I lifted up my soul in 
speechless, earnest supplication, some heavenly influence seemed to 
strengthen me within:* I breathed more freely; my vision cleared; I saw 
distinctly the pure moon shining on, and the light clouds skimming the 
clear, dark sky; and then, I saw the eternal stars twinkling down upon 
me; I knew their God was mine, and He was strong to save and swift to 
hear. `I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,' seemed whispered 
from above their myriad orbs. No, no; I felt He would not leave me 
comfortless:* in spite of earth and hell I should have strength for all 
my trials, and win a glorious rest at last! 
</p>
               <p>Refreshed, invigorated if not composed, I rose and returned to 
the house. Much of my newborn strength and courage forsook me, I 
confess, as I entered it, and shut out the fresh wind and the glorious 
sky: everything I saw and heard seemed to sicken my heart—the hall, 
the lamp, the staircase, the doors of the different apartments, the 
social sound of talk and laughter from the drawing-room. How could I 
bear my future life? In this house, among those people—oh, how could I 
endure to live! 
John just then entered the 
hall, and seeing me, told me he had been sent in search of me, adding that he 
had taken in 
the tea, and master wished to know if I were coming. 
</p>
               <p>`Ask Mrs. Hattersley to be so kind as to make the tea, John,' said I. `Say I 
am not well 
to-night, and wish to be excused.' 
</p>
               <p>I retired into the large, empty dining-room, where all was silence and 
darkness, but for the 
soft sighing of the wind without, and the faint gleam of moonlight that 
pierced the blinds 
and curtains; and there I walked rapidly up and down, thinking my bitter 
thoughts alone. 
How different was this from the evening of yesterday! <hi>That</hi> it seems, 
was the last 
expiring flash of my life's happiness. Poor, blinded fool that I was, to be 
so happy! I 
could now see the reason of Arthur's strange reception of me in the 
shrubbery: the burst 
of kindness was for his paramour, the start of horror for his wife. Now, too, 
I could better 
understand the conversation between Hattersley and Grimsby: it was doubtless 
of his love 
for <hi>her</hi> they spoke, not for me. 
</p>
               <p>I heard the drawing-room door open: a light quick step came out of the 
ante-room, crossed 
the hall, and ascended the stairs. It was Milicent, poor Milicent, gone to 
see how I 
was—no one else cared for me; but <hi>she</hi> still was kind. I had shed no 
tears before, 
but now they came—fast and free. Thus she did me good, without approaching 
me. 
Disappointed in her search, I heard her come down—more slowly than she had 
ascended. 
Would she come in there, and find me out? No; she turned in the opposite 
direction and 
re-entered the drawing-room. I was glad, for I knew not how to meet her, or 
what to say. I 
wanted no confidant in my distress. I deserved none—and I wanted none. I had 
taken the 
burden upon myself: let me bear it alone. 
</p>
               <p>As the usual hour of retirement approached, I dried my eyes, and tried to 
clear my voice 
and calm my mind. I must see Arthur to-night, and speak to him; but I would 
do it 
calmly: there should be no scene—nothing to complain or to boast of to his 
companions—nothing to laugh at with his lady love. When the company were 
retiring to 
their chambers, I gently opened the door, and just as he passed, I beckoned 
him in. 
</p>
               <p>`What's to do with <hi>you,</hi> Helen?' said he. `Why couldn't you come to 
make tea for 
us? and what the deuce are you here for, in the dark? What ails you, young 
woman—you 
look like a ghost?' he 
continued, surveying me by the light of his candle. 
</p>
               <p>`No matter,' I answered— `to you—-you have no longer any regard 
for me, it appears; and I have no longer any for you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Hal-low! what the devil is this?' he muttered. 
</p>
               <p>`I would leave you to-morrow,' continued I, `and never again come 
under this roof, but for my child'—I paused a moment to steady my 
voice. 
</p>
               <p>`What in the devil's name <hi>is</hi> this, Helen?' cried he. `What 
can you be driving at?' 
</p>
               <p>`You know, perfectly well. Let us waste no time in useless 
explanation, but tell me, will you—' 
</p>
               <p>He vehemently swore he knew nothing about it, and insisted upon 
hearing what poisonous old woman had been blackening his name, and what 
infamous lies I had been fool enough to believe. 
</p>
               <p>`Spare yourself the trouble of forswearing yourself and racking 
your brains to stifle truth with falsehood,' I coldly replied. `I have 
trusted to the testimony of no third person. I was in the shrubbery 
this evening, and I saw and heard for myself.' 
</p>
               <p>This was enough. He uttered a suppressed exclamation of 
consternation and dismay, and muttering, `I <hi>shall</hi> catch it now!' 
set down his candle on the nearest chair, and, rearing his back against 
the wall, stood confronting me with folded arms. 
</p>
               <p>`Well!—what then?' said he, with the calm insolence of mingled 
shamelessness and desperation. 
</p>
               <p>`Only this,' returned I: `will you let me take our child and what 
remains of my fortune, and go?' 
</p>
               <p>`Go where?' 
</p>
               <p>`Anywhere, where he will be safe from your contaminating 
influence, and I shall be delivered from your presence—and you from 
mine.' 
</p>
               <p>`No—by <hi>Jove</hi> I won't!' 
</p>
               <p>`Will you let me have the child then, without the money?' 
</p>
               <p>`Nor yourself without the child. Do you think I'm going to be 
made the talk of the country, for your fastidious caprices?' 
</p>
               <p>`Then I must stay here; to be hated and despised.—But 
henceforth, we are husband and wife only in the name.' 
</p>
               <p>`Very good.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am your child's mother, and <hi>your</hi> housekeeper—nothing 
more. So you need not trouble yourself any longer, to feign the love 
you cannot feel: I will exact no more heartless caresses from 
you—nor offer—nor endure them either—I will not be mocked with 
the empty husk of conjugal endearments, when you have given the 
substance to another!' 
</p>
               <p>`Very good—if you please. We shall see who will tire first, my 
lady.' 
</p>
               <p>`If I tire, it will be of living in the world with you; not of 
living without your mockery of love. When <hi>you</hi> tire of your 
sinful ways, and show yourself truly repentant, I will forgive 
you—and, perhaps, try to love you again, though that will be hard 
indeed.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humph!—and meantime, you will go and talk me over to Mrs. 
Hargrave, and write long letters to aunt Maxwell to complain of the 
wicked wretch you have married?' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall complain to no one. Hitherto, I have struggled hard to hide 
your vices from every eye, and invest you with virtues you never 
possessed—but now you must look to yourself.' 
</p>
               <p>I left him—muttering bad language to himself, and went up stairs. 
</p>
               <p>`You are poorly Ma'am,' said Rachel, surveying me with deep anxiety. 
</p>
               <p>`It is too true, Rachel!' said I, answering her sad looks rather 
than her words. 
</p>
               <p>`I knew it—or I wouldn't have mentioned such a thing.' 
</p>
               <p>`But don't <hi>you</hi> trouble yourself about it,' said I, kissing 
her pale, time-wasted cheek— `I can bear it—better than you 
imagine.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, you were always for “bearing. “—But if I was you I wouldn't 
bear it—I'd give way to it, and cry right hard!—and I'd talk too, 
I just <hi>would</hi>—I'd let him know what it was to— 
</p>
               <p>`I have talked,' said I: `I've said enough.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then I'd cry,' persisted she. `I wouldn't look so white and so calm, and 
burst my heart 
with 
keeping it in!' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>have</hi> cried,' said I, smiling in spite of my misery; `and I <hi>am </hi> calm now, 
really, so don't discompose me again, nurse: let us say no more about it—and 
<hi>don't</hi>, 
mention it to the servants.—There, you may go now. Good night;—and don't 
disturb your 
rest for me: 
I shall sleep well—if I can.' 
</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this resolution, I found my bed so intolerable 
that, before two o'clock, I rose, and, lighting my candle by the 
rushlight that was still burning, I got my desk and sat down in my 
dressing-gown to recount the events of the past evening. It was better 
to be so occupied than to be lying in bed torturing my brain with 
recollections of the far past and anticipations of the dreadful future. 
I have found relief in describing the very circumstances that have 
destroyed my peace, as well as the little trivial details attendant 
upon their discovery. No sleep I could have got this night would have 
done so much towards composing my mind, and preparing me to meet the 
trials of the day—I fancy so, at least—and yet, when I cease writing, 
I find my head aches terribly; and when I look into the glass I am 
startled at my haggard, worn appearance. 
</p>
               <p>Rachel has been to dress me, and says I have had a sad night of 
it she can see. Milicent has just looked in to ask me how I was. I told 
her I was better, but to excuse my appearance admitted I had had a 
restless night.—I wish this day were over! I shudder at the thoughts 
of going down to breakfast—how shall I encounter them all?—Yet let 
me remember it is not <hi>I</hi> that am guilty: <hi>I</hi> have no cause 
to fear; and if <hi>they</hi> scorn me as the victim of their guilt, I 
can pity their folly and despise their scorn.

               <head>CONCEALMENT</head>
               <p>Evening. Breakfast passed well over, I was calm and cool throughout. 
I answered composedly all enquiries respecting my health; and whatever 
was unusual in my look or manner, was generally attributed to the 
trifling indisposition that had occasioned my early retirement last 
night. But how am I to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet 
elapse before they go? Yet why so long for their departure? When they 
are gone how shall I get through the months or years of my future life, 
in company with that manly greatest enemy—for none could injure me as 
he has done? Oh! when I think how fondly, how foolishly I have loved 
him, how madly I have trusted him, how constantly I have laboured, and 
studied, and prayed, and struggled for his advantage; and how cruelly 
he has trampled on my love, betrayed my trust, scorned my prayers and 
tears, and efforts for his preservation—rushed my hopes, destroyed my 
youth's best feelings, and doomed me to a life of hopeless misery—as 
far as man can do it—it is not enough to say that I no longer love my 
husband—I HATE him! The word stares me in the face like a guilty 
confession, but it is true: I hate him—I hate him!—But God have mercy 
on his miserable soul!—and make him see and feel his guilt—I ask no 
other vengeance! If he could but fully know and truly feel my wrongs, 
I should be well avenged; and I could freely pardon all; but he is so 
lost, so hardened in his heartless depravity that, in this life, I 
believe he never will. But it is useless dwelling on this theme: let 
me seek once more to dissipate reflection in the minor details of 
passing events. 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Hargrave has annoyed me all day long with his serious, 
sympathizing, and (as he thinks) unobtrusive politeness—if it were 
more obtrusive it would trouble me less, for then I could snub him; 
but, as it is, he contrives to appear so really kind and thoughtful 
that I cannot do so without rudeness and seeming ingratitude. I 
sometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he 
simulates so well; and then again, I think it is my duty to suspect him 
under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed. His kindness may 
not all be feigned, but still, let not the purest impulse of gratitude 
to him, induce me to forget myself, let me remember the game of chess, 
the expressions he used on the occasion, and those indescribable looks 
of his, that so justly roused my indignation, and I think I shall be 
safe enough. I have done well to record them so minutely. 
</p>
               <p>I think he wishes to find an opportunity of speaking to me alone: he 
has seemed to be on the watch all day, but I have taken care to 
disappoint him; not that I fear anything he could say, but I have 
trouble enough without the addition of his insulting consolations, 
condolences, or whatever else he might attempt; and, for Milicent's 
sake, I do not wish to quarrel with him. He excused himself from going 
out to shoot with the other gentlemen in the morning, under the pretext 
of having letters to write; and instead of retiring for that purpose 
into the library, he sent for his desk into the morning-room where I 
was seated with Milicent and Lady Lowborough. They had betaken 
themselves to their work; I, less to divert my mind than to deprecate 
conversation, had provided myself with a book. Milicent saw that I 
wished to be quiet, and accordingly let me alone. Annabella, doubtless, 
saw it too; but that was no reason why she should restrain her tongue, 
or curb her cheerful spirits: she accordingly chatted away, addressing 
herself almost exclusively to me, and with the utmost assurance and 
familiarity, growing the more animated and friendly, the colder and 
briefer my answers became. Mr. Hargrave saw that I could ill endure it; 
and, looking up from his desk, he answered her questions and 
observations for me, as far as he could, and attempted to transfer her 
social attentions from me to himself; but it would not do. Perhaps, she 
thought I had a headache and could not bear to talk—at any rate, she 
saw that her loquacious vivacity annoyed me as I could tell by the 
malicious pertinacity with which she persisted. But I checked it, 
effectually, by putting into her hand the book I had been trying to 
read, on the fly leaf of which I had hastily scribbled,— 
</p>
               <p>`I am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any 
real friendship for you, and, as I am without your talent for 
dissimulation, I cannot assume the appearance of it. I must, therefore, 
beg that hereafter, all familiar intercourse may cease between us; and 
if I still continue to treat you with civility, as if you were a woman 
worthy of consideration and respect, understand that it is out of 
regard for your cousin Milicent's feelings, not for yours.' 
</p>
               <p>Upon perusing this, she turned scarlet and bit her lip. Covertly 
tearing away the leaf, she crumpled it up and put it in the fire, and 
then employed herself in turning over the pages of the book and, really 
or apparently, perusing its contents. In a little while Milicent 
announced it her intention to repair to the nursery, and asked if I 
would accompany her. 
</p>
               <p>`Annabella will excuse us,' said she, `she's busy reading.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I won't,' cried Annabella, suddenly looking-up and throwing her 
book on the table. `I want to speak to Helen a minute. You may go 
Milicent, and she'll follow in a while.' (Milicent went.) `Will you 
oblige me, Helen?' continued she. 
</p>
               <p>Her impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the 
library. She closed the door, and walked up to the fire. 
</p>
               <p>`Who fold you this?' said she. 
</p>
               <p>`No one: I am not incapable of seeing for myself.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah, you are suspicious!' cried she, smiling with a' gleam of hop— 
hitherto, there had been a kind of desperation in her hardihood; now 
she was evidently relieved. 
</p>
               <p>`if I were suspicious,' I replied, `I should have discovered your 
infamy long before. No, Lady Lowborough, I do not found my charge upon 
suspicion.' 
</p>
               <p>`On what do you found it then?' said she, throwing herself into an 
arm-chair, and stretching out her feet to the fender, with an obvious 
effort to appear composed. 
</p>
               <p>`I enjoy a moonlight ramble as well as you,' I answered, steadily 
fixing my eyes upon her: `and the shrubbery happens to be one of my 
favourite resorts. 
</p>
               <p>She coloured again, excessively, and remained silent, pressing her 
finger against her teeth, and gazing into the fire. I watched her a few 
moments with a feeling of malevolent gratification; then, moving 
towards the door, I calmly asked if she had anything more to say. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, yes!' cried she eagerly, starting up from her reclining posture. 
`I want to know if you will tell Lord Lowborough?' 
</p>
               <p>`Suppose I do?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, if you are disposed to publish the matter, I cannot dissuade 
you, of course—but there will be terrible work if you do—and if you 
don't, I shall think you the most generous of mortal beings—and if 
there is anything in the world I can do for you—anything short of—' 
she hesitated. 
</p>
               <p>`Short of renouncing your guilty connection with my husband, I suppose 
you mean, said I. 
</p>
               <p>She paused, in evident disconcertion and perplexity, mingled with anger 
she dared not show. 
</p>
               <p>`I cannot renounce what is dearer than life,' she muttered in a low, 
hurried tone. Then, suddenly raising her head and fixing her gleaming 
eyes upon me, she continued earnestly, `But Helen—or Mrs. Huntingdon, 
or whatever you would have me call you—will you tell him? If you are 
generous, here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your 
magnanimity: if you are proud, here am I—your rival—ready to 
acknowledge myself your debtor for an act of the most noble 
forbearance.' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall not tell him.' 
</p>
               <p>`You will not!' cried she delightedly. `Accept my sincere thanks, 
then!' 
</p>
               <p>She sprang up, and offered me her hand. I drew back. 
</p>
               <p>`Give me no thanks; it is not for your sake that I refrain. Neither is 
it an act of any forbearance: I have no wish to publish your shame. I 
should be sorry to distress your husband with the knowledge of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`And Milicent? will you tell her?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, on the contrary I shall do my utmost to conceal it from her. I 
would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her 
relation!' 
</p>
               <p>`You use hard words, Mrs. Huntingdon—but I can pardon you.' 
</p>
               <p>`And now Lady Lowborough,' continued I, `let me counsel you to leave 
this house as soon as possible. You must be aware that your continuance 
here is excessively disagreeable to me—not for Mr. Huntingdon's sake,' 
said I, observing the dawn of a malicious smile of triumph on her 
face—'you are welcome to him, if you like him, as far as I am 
concerned—but because it is painful to be always disguising my true 
sentiments respecting you, and straining to keep up an appearance of 
civility and respect towards one for whom I have not the most distant 
shadow of esteem; and because, if you stay, your conduct cannot 
possibly remain concealed much longer from the only two persons in the 
house who do not know it already. And, for your husband's sake, 
Annabella, and even for your own, I wish—I earnestly advise and 
entreat you to break off this unlawful connection at once, and return 
to your duty while you may, before the dreadful consequences—' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, yes, of course,' said she, interrupting me with a gesture of 
impatience.—'But I cannot go, Helen, before the time appointed for our 
departure. What possible pretext could I frame for such a thing? 
Whether I proposed going back alone—which Lowborough would not hear 
of—or taking him with me, the very circumstance itself, would be 
certain to excite suspicion— and when our visit is so nearly at an end 
too-little more than a week—surely, you can endure my presence so 
long! I will not annoy you with any more of my friendly 
impertinences.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well! I have nothing more to say to you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Have you mentioned this affair to Huntingdon?' asked she, as I was 
leaving the room. 
</p>
               <p>`How dare you mention his name to me!' was the only answer I gave. 
</p>
               <p>No words have passed between us since, but such as outward decency or 
pure necessity demanded. 
</p>

               <head>PROVOCATIONS</head>
               <p>Nineteenth.—In proportion as Lady Lowborough finds she has nothing to 
fear from me, and as the time of departure draws nigh, the more 
audacious and insolent she becomes. She does not scruple to speak to 
my husband with affectionate familiarity in my presence, when no one 
else is by, and is particularly fond of displaying her interest in his 
health and welfare, or in anything that concerns him, as if for the 
purpose of contrasting her kind solicitude with my cold indifference. 
And he rewards her by such smiles and glances, such whispered words, 
or boldly spoken insinuations, indicative of his sense of her goodness 
and my neglect, as makes the blood rush into my face, in spite of 
myself—for I would be utterly regardless of it all deaf and blind to 
everything that passes between them, since the more I show myself 
sensible of their wickedness, the more she triumphs in her victory, and 
the more he flatters himself that I love him devotedly still, in spite 
of my pretended indifference. On such occasions I have sometimes been 
startled by a subtle, fiendish suggestion inciting me to show him the 
contrary by a seeming encouragement of Hargrave's advances; but such 
ideas are banished in a moment with horror and self-abasement; and then 
I hate him tenfold more than ever, for having brought me to this!—God 
pardon me for it—and all my sinful thoughts! Instead of being humbled 
and purified by my afflictions, I feel that they are turning my nature 
into gall. This must be my fault as much as theirs that wrong me. No 
true Christian could cherish such bitter feelings as I do against him 
and her—especially the latter: him, I still feel that I could 
pardon—freely, gladly—on the slightest token of repentance; but 
she—words cannot utter my abhorrence. Reason forbids, but passion 
urges strongly; and I must pray and struggle long ere I subdue it. 
</p>
               <p>     It is well that she is leaving to-morrow, for I could not well 
endure her presence for another day. This morning, she rose earlier 
than usual. I found her in the room alone, when I went down to 
breakfast. 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh Helen! is it you?' said she, turning as I entered. 
</p>
               <p>     I gave an involuntary start back on seeing her, at which she 
uttered a short laugh, observing,— 
</p>
               <p>     `I think we are both disappointed.' 
</p>
               <p>     I came forward and busied myself with the breakfast-things. 
</p>
               <p>     `This is the last day I shall burden your hospitality,' said she, 
as she seated herself at the table. `Ah, here comes one that will not 
rejoice at it!' she murmured, half to herself, as Arthur entered the 
room. 
</p>
               <p>     He shook hands with her and wished her good morning: then, 
looking lovingly in her face, and still retaining her hand in his, 
murmured pathetically,— 
</p>
               <p>     `The last—last day!' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes,' said she with some asperity; `and I rose early to make the 
best of it—I have been here alone this half hour, and you, you lazy 
creature' 
</p>
               <p>     `Well, I thought I was early too,' said he— `but,' dropping his 
voice almost to a whisper, `you see we are not alone.' 
</p>
               <p>     `We never are,' returned she. But they were almost as good as 
alone, for I was now standing at the window, watching the clouds, and 
struggling to suppress my wrath. 
</p>
               <p>     Some more words passed between them, which, happily, I did not 
overhear; but Annabella had the audacity to come and place herself 
beside me, and even to put her hand upon my shoulder and say 
softly,— 
</p>
               <p>     `You need not grudge him to me, Helen, for I love him more than 
ever you could do.' 
</p>
               <p>     This put me beside myself. I took her hand and violently dashed 
it from me, with an expression of abhorrence and indignation that could 
not be suppressed. Startled, almost appalled, by this sudden outbreak, 
she recoiled in silence. I would have given way to my fury and said 
more, but Arthur's low laugh recalled me to myself. I checked the 
half-uttered invective, and scornfully turned away, regretting that I 
had given him so much amusement. He was still laughing when Mr. 
Hargrave made his appearance. How much of the scene he had witnessed 
I do not know, for the door was ajar when he entered. He greeted his 
host and his cousin both coldly, and me with a glance intended to 
express the deepest sympathy mingled with high admiration and 
esteem. 
</p>
               <p>      `How much allegiance do you owe to that man?' he asked below his 
breath, as he stood beside me at the window, affecting to be making 
observations on the weather. 
</p>
               <p>     `None,' I answered. And immediately returning to the table, I 
employed myself in making the tea. He followed, and would have entered 
into some kind of conversation with me, but the other guests were now 
beginning to assemble and I took no more notice of him, except to give 
him his coffee. 
</p>
               <p>     After breakfast, determined to pass as little of the day as 
possible in company with Lady Lowborough, I quietly stole away from the 
company and retired to the library. Mr. Hargrave followed me thither, 
under pretence of coming for a book; and first, turning to the shelves, 
he selected a volume; and then, quietly, but by no means timidly, 
approaching me, he stood beside me, resting his hand on the back of my 
chair, and said softly,— 
</p>
               <p>     `And so you consider yourself free, at last?' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes,' said I, without moving, or raising my eyes from my book, 
`free to do anything but offend God and my conscience.' 
</p>
               <p>     There was a momentary pause. 
</p>
               <p>     `Very right,' said he; `provided your conscience be not too 
morbidly tender, and your ideas of God not too erroneously severe; but 
can you suppose it would offend that benevolent Being to make the 
happiness of one who would die for yours?—to raise a devoted heart 
from purgatorial torments to a state of heavenly bliss when you could 
do it without the slightest injury to yourself or any other?' 
</p>
               <p>     This was spoken in a low, earnest, melting tone as he bent over 
me. I now raised my head; and, steadily confronting his gaze, I 
answered calmly,— 
</p>
               <p>     `Mr. Hargrave, do you mean to insult me?' 
</p>
               <p>     He was not prepared for this. He paused a moment to recover the 
shock;' then, drawing himself up and removing his hand from my chair, 
he answered, with proud sadness,— 
</p>
               <p>     `That was not my intention.' 
</p>
               <p>     I just glanced towards the door, with a slight movement of the 
head, and then returned to my book. He immediately withdrew. This was 
better than if I had answered with more words, and in the passionate 
spirit to which my first impulse would have prompted. What a good thing 
it is to be able to command one's temper! I must labour to cultivate 
this inestimable quality: God, only, knows how often I shall need it 
in this rough, dark road that lies before me. 
</p>
               <p>     In the course of the morning, I drove over to the Grove with the 
two ladies, to give Milicent an opportunity for bidding farewell to her 
mother and sister. They persuaded her to stay with them the rest of the 
day, Mrs. Hargrave promising to bring her back in the evening and 
remain till the party broke up on the morrow. Consequently, Lady 
Lowborough and I had the pleasure of returning tête-a-tête 
in the carriage together. For the first mile or two, we kept silence, 
I looking out of my window, and she leaning back in her corner. But I 
was not going to restrict myself to any particular position for her: 
when I was tired of leaning forward, with the cold, raw wind in my 
face; and surveying the russet hedges, and the damp, tangled grass of 
their banks, I gave it up, and leant back too. With her usual 
impudence, my companion then made some attempts to get up a 
conversation; but the monosyllables `yes,' or `no,' or `humph,' were 
the utmost her several remarks could elicit from me. At last, on her 
asking my opinion upon some immaterial point of discussion, I 
answered,— 
</p>
               <p>     `Why do you wish to talk to me, Lady Lowborough?—you must know 
what I think of you.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Well, if you will be so bitter against me,' replied she, `I 
can't help it;—but I'm not going to sulk for anybody.' 
</p>
               <p>     Our short drive was now at an end. As soon as the carriage door 
was opened, she sprang out, and went down the park to meet the 
gentlemen, who were just returning from the woods. Of course I did not 
follow. 
</p>
               <p>     But I had not done with her impudence yet:—after dinner, I 
retired to the drawing-room, as usual, and she accompanied me, but I 
had the two children with me, and I gave them my whole attention, and 
determined to keep them till the gentlemen came, or till Milicent 
arrived with her mother. Little Helen, however, was soon tired of 
playing, and insisted upon going to sleep; and while I sat on the sofa 
with her on my knee, and Arthur seated beside me, gently playing with 
her soft, flaxen hair,—Lady Lowborough composedly came and placed 
herself on the other side. 
</p>
               <p>     `To-morrow, Mrs. Huntingdon,' said she, `you will be delivered 
from my presence, which, no doubt, you will be very glad oft is natural 
you should;—but do you know I have rendered you a great 
service?—Shall I tell you what it is?' 
</p>
               <p>     `I shall be glad to hear of any service you have rendered me,' 
said I, determined to be calm, for I knew by the tone of her voice she 
wanted to provoke me. 
</p>
               <p>     `Well,' resumed she, `have you not observed this salutary change 
in Mr. Huntingdon? Don't you see what a sober, temperate man he is 
become? You saw with regret the sad habits he was contracting, I know; 
and I know you did your utmost to deliver him from them,—but without 
success, until I came to your assistance. I told him, in few words, 
that I could not bear to see him degrade himself so, and that I should 
cease too matter what I told him,—but you see the reformation I have 
wrought; and you ought to thank me for it.' 
</p>
               <p>     I rose, and rang for the nurse. 
</p>
               <p>     `But I desire no thanks,' she continued, `all the return I ask 
is, that you will take care of him when I am gone, and not, by 
harshness and neglect, drive him back to his old courses.' 
</p>
               <p>     I was almost sick with passion, but Rachel was now at the door: 
I pointed to the children, for I could not trust myself to speak: she 
took them away, and I followed. 
</p>
               <p>     `Will you, Helen?' continued the speaker. 
</p>
               <p>     I gave her a look that blighted the malicious smile on her 
face—or checked it, at least for a moment—and departed. In the 
anteroom I met Mr. Hargrave. He saw I was in no humour to be spoken to, 
and suffered me to pass without a word; but when, after a few minutes” 
seclusion in the library, I had regained my composure, and was 
returning, to join Mrs. Hargrave and Milicent, whom I had just heard 
come down stairs and go into the drawing-room,—I found him there 
still, lingering in the dimly lighted apartment, and evidently waiting 
for me. 
</p>
               <p>     `Mrs. Huntingdon,' said he as I passed, `will you allow me one 
word?' 
</p>
               <p>     `What is it then?—be quick if you please.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I offended you this morning; and I cannot live under your 
displeasure.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Then, go, and sin no more,” replied I, turning away. 
</p>
               <p>     `No, no!' said he hastily, setting himself before me— `pardon 
me, but I must have your forgiveness. I leave you to-morrow, and I may 
not have an opportunity of speaking to you again. I was wrong, to 
forget myself—and you, as I did; but let me implore you to forget and 
forgive my rash presumption, and think of me as if those words had 
never been spoken; for, believe me, I regret them deeply, and the loss 
of your esteem is too severe a penalty—I cannot bear it.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Forgetfulness is not to be purchased with a wish; and I cannot 
bestow my esteem on all who desire it, unless they deserve it too.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I shall think my life well spent in labouring to deserve it, if 
you will but pardon this offence.—Will you?' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes? but that is coldly spoken. Give me your hand and I'll 
believe you.—You won't? Then, Mrs. Huntingdon, you do not forgive 
me!' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes—here it is, and my forgiveness with it: only—sin no 
more.' 
</p>
               <p>      He pressed my cold hand with sentimental fervour, but said 
nothing, and stood aside to let me pass into the room, where all the 
company were now assembled. Mr. Grimsby was seated near the door: on 
seeing me enter almost immediately followed by Hargrave, he leered at 
me, with a glance of intolerable significance, as I passed. I looked 
him in the face, till he sullenly turned away, if not ashamed, at least 
confounded for the moment. Meantime, Hattersley had seized Hargrave by 
the arm, and was whispering something in his ear—some coarse joke, no 
doubt, for the latter neither laughed nor spoke in answer, but, turning 
from him with a slight curl of the lip, disengaged himself and went to 
his mother, who `was telling Lord Lowborough how many reasons she had 
to be proud of her son. 
</p>
               <p>     Thank Heaven, they are all going to-morrow.

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI</head>
               <head>DUAL SOLITUDE</head>
               <p>December 20th, 1824.—This is the third anniversary of our felicitous 
union. It is now two months since our guests left us to the enjoyment 
of each other's society; and I have had nine weeks' experience of this 
new phase of conjugal life—two persons living together, as master and 
mistress of the house, and father and mother of a winsome, merry little 
child, with the mutual understanding that there is no love, friendship, 
or sympathy between them. As far as in me lies, I endeavour to live 
peaceably with him: I treat him with unimpeachable civility, give up 
my convenience to his, wherever it may reasonably be done, and consult 
him in a business-like way on household affairs, deferring to his 
pleasure and judgment, even when I know the latter to be inferior to 
my own. 
</p>
               <p>As for him: for the first week or two, he was peevish and 
low—fretting, I suppose, over his dear Annabella's departure and 
particularly ill-tempered to me: everything I did was wrong; I was 
cold-hearted, hard, insensate; my sour, pale face was perfectly 
repulsive; my voice made him shudder; he knew not how he could live 
through the winter with me; I should kill him by inches. Again I 
proposed a separation, but it would not do: he was not going to be the 
talk of all the old gossips in the neighbourhood: he would not have it 
said that he was such a brute his wife could not live with him;—no; 
he must contrive to bear with me. 
</p>
               <p>`I must contrive to bear with you you mean,' said I, `for as long 
as I discharge my functions of steward and housekeeper, so 
conscientiously and well, without pay and without thanks, you cannot 
afford to part with me. I shall therefore remit these duties when my 
bondage becomes intolerable.' This threat, I thought, would serve to 
keep him in check, if anything would. 
</p>
               <p>I believe he was much disappointed that I did not feel his 
offensive sayings more acutely, for when he had said anything 
particularly well calculated to hurt my feelings, he would stare me 
searchingly in the face, and then grumble against my `marble heart,' 
or my `brutal insensibility.' If I had bitterly wept, and deplored his 
lost affection, he would, perhaps, have condescended to pity me, and 
taken me into favour for a while, just to comfort his solitude and 
console him for the absence of his beloved Annabella, until he could 
meet her again, or some more fitting substitute. Thank Heaven, I am not 
so weak as that! I was infatuated once, with a foolish, besotted 
affection, that clung to him in spite of his unworthiness, but it is 
fairly gone now—wholly crushed and withered away; and he has none but 
himself and his vices to thank for it. 
</p>
               <p>At first (in compliance with his sweet lady's injunctions, I 
suppose), he abstained wonderfully well from seeking to solace his 
cares in wine; but at length he began to relax his virtuous efforts, 
and now and then exceeded a little, and still continues to do so—nay, 
sometimes, not a little. When he is under the exciting influence of 
these excesses, he sometimes fires up and attempts to play the brute; 
and then I take little pains to suppress my scorn and disgust: when he 
is under the depressing influence of the after consequences, he bemoans 
his sufferings and his errors, and charges them both upon me; he knows 
such indulgence injures his health, and does him more harm than good; 
but he says I drive him to it by my unnatural, unwomanly conduct; it 
will be the ruin of him in the end, but it is all my fault;—and then, 
I am roused to defend myself—sometimes, with bitter recrimination. 
This is a kind of injustice I cannot patiently endure. Have I not 
laboured long and hard to save him from this very vice? Would I not 
labour still, to deliver him from it, if I could? But could I do so by 
fawning upon him and caressing him when I know that he scorns me? Is 
it my fault that I have lost my influence with him, or that he has 
forfeited every claim to my regard? And should I seek a reconciliation 
with him, when I feel that I abhor him, and that he despises me?—and 
while he continues still to correspond with Lady Lowborough, as I know 
he does? No, never, never, never!—he may drink himself dead, but it 
is NOT my fault! 
</p>
               <p>Yet I do my part to save him still: I give him to understand that 
drinking makes his eyes dull, and his face red and bloated; and that 
it tends to render him imbecile in body and mind; and if Annabella were 
to see him as often as I do, she would speedily be disenchanted; and 
that she certainly will withdraw her favour from him, if he continues 
such courses. Such a mode of admonition wins only coarse abuse for 
me—and indeed I almost feel as if I deserved it, for I hate to use 
such arguments, but they sink into his stupified heart, and make him 
pause, and ponder, and abstain, more than anything else I could say. 
</p>
               <p>At present, I am enjoying a temporary relief from his presence: 
he is gone with Hargrave to join a distant hunt, and will probably not 
be back before to-morrow evening. How differently I used to feel his 
absence! 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Hargrave is still at the Grove. He and Arthur frequently meet 
to pursue their rural sports together: he often calls upon us here, and 
Arthur not unfrequently rides over to him. I do not think either of 
these soi-disant friends is overflowing with love for the other; but 
such intercourse serves to get the time on, and I am very willing it 
should continue, as it saves me some hours of discomfort in Arthur's 
society, and gives him some better employment than the sottish 
indulgence of his sensual appetites. The only objection I have to Mr. 
Hargrave's being in the neighbourhood, is that the fear of meeting him 
at the Grove, prevents me from seeing his sister so often as I 
otherwise should; for, of late he has conducted himself towards me with 
such unerring propriety that I have almost forgotten his former 
conduct. I suppose he is striving to `win my esteem.' If he continue 
to act in this way, he may win it;—but what then? the moment he 
attempts to demand anything more, he will lose it again. 
</p>
               <p>February 10th.—It is a hard, embittering thing to have one's 
kind feelings and good intentions cast back in one's teeth. I was 
beginning to relent towards my wretched partner—to pity his forlorn, 
comfortless condition, unalleviated as it is by the consolations of 
intellectual resources and the answer of a good conscience towards 
God—and to think I ought to sacrifice my pride, and renew my efforts 
once again to make his home agreeable and lead him back to the path of 
virtue; not by false professions of love, and not by pretended remorse, 
but by mitigating my habitual coldness of manner, and commuting my 
frigid civility into kindness wherever an opportunity occurred; and not 
only was I beginning to think so, but I had already begun to act upon 
the thought—and what was the result? No answering spark of 
kindness—no awakening penitence, but an unappeasable ill-humour and 
a spirit of tyrannous exaction that increased with indulgence, and a 
lurking gleam of self-complacent triumph, at every detection of 
relenting softness in my manner, that congealed me to marble again as 
often as it recurred; and this morning he finished the business:—I 
think the petrifaction is so completely effected at last, that nothing 
can melt me again. Among his letters was one which he perused with 
symptoms of unusual gratification, and then threw across the table to 
me, with the admonition,— 
</p>
               <p>`There! read that, and take a lesson by it!' 
</p>
               <p>It was in the free, dashing hand of Lady Lowborough. I glanced 
at the first page; it seemed full of extravagant protestations of 
affection; impetuous longings for a speedy reunion; and impious 
defiance of God's mandates, and railings against His Providence for 
having cast their lot asunder, and doomed them both to the hateful 
bondage of alliance with those they could not love. He gave a slight 
titter on seeing me change colour. I folded up the letter, rose, and 
returned it to him, with no remark but,— 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you—I will take a lesson by it!' 
</p>
               <p>My little Arthur was standing between his knees, delightedly 
playing with the bright, ruby ring on his finger. Urged by a sudden, 
imperative impulse to deliver my son from that contaminating influence, 
I caught him up in my arms and carried him with me out of the room. Not 
liking this abrupt removal, the child began to pout and cry. This was 
a new stab to my already tortured heart. I would not let him go; but, 
taking him with me into the library, I shut the door, and, kneeling on 
the floor beside him, I embraced him, kissed him, wept over him with 
passionate fondness. Rather frightened than consoled by this, he turned 
struggling from me and cried out aloud for his papa. I released him 
from my arms, and never were more bitter tears than those that now 
concealed him from my blinded, burning eyes. Hearing his cries, the 
father came to the room. I instantly turned away lest he should see and 
misconstrue my emotion. He swore at me, and took the now pacified child 
away. 
</p>
               <p> It is hard that my little darling should love him more than me; 
and that, when the well-being and culture of my son is all I have to 
live for, I should see my influence destroyed by one whose selfish 
affection is more injurious than the coldest indifference or the 
harshest tyranny could be. If I, for his good, deny him some trifling 
indulgence, he goes to his father, and the latter, in spite of his 
selfish indolence, will even give himself some trouble to meet the 
child's desires: if I attempt to curb his will, or look gravely on him 
for some act of childish disobedience, he knows his other parent will 
smile and take his part against me. Thus, not only have I the father's 
spirit in the son to contend against; the germs of his evil tendencies 
to search out and eradicate, and his corrupting intercourse and example 
in after life to counteract, but already he counteracts my arduous 
labour for the child's advantage, destroys my influence over his tender 
mind, and robs me of his very love;—I had no earthly hope but this, 
and he seems to take a diabolical delight in tearing it away. 
</p>
               <p>But it is wrong to despair; I will remember the counsel of the 
inspired writer to him `that feareth the Lord and obeyeth the voice of 
his servant, that sitteth in darkness and hath no light;— let him 
trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God!'

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII</head>
               <head>THE NEIGHBOUR AGAIN</head>
               <p>December 20th, 1825.—Another year is past; and I am weary of this 
life. And yet, I cannot wish to leave it: whatever afflictions assail 
me here, I cannot wish to go and leave my darling in this dark and 
wicked world alone, without a friend to guide him through its weary 
mazes, to warn him of its thousand snares, and guard him from the 
perils that beset him on every hand. I am not well fitted to be his 
only companion, I know; but there is no other to supply my place. I am 
too grave to minister to his amusements and enter into his infantile 
sports as a nurse or a mother ought to do, and often his bursts of 
gleeful merriment trouble and alarm me; I see in them his father's 
spirit and temperament, and I tremble for the consequences; and, too 
often, damp the innocent mirth I ought to share. That father on the 
contrary has no weight of sadness on his minds troubled with no fears, 
no scruples concerning his son's future welfare; and at evenings 
especially, the times when the child sees him the most and the 
oftenest, he is always particularly jocund and open-hearted: ready to 
laugh and to jest with anything or anybody—but mend I am particularly 
silent and sad: therefore, of course, the child dotes upon his 
seemingly joyous, amusing, ever indulgent papa, and will at any time 
gladly exchange my company for his. This disturbs me greatly; not so 
much for the sake of my son's affection (though I do prize that highly, 
and though I feel it is my right, and know I have done much to earn 
it), as for that influence over him which, for his own advantage, I 
would strive to purchase and retain, and which for very spite his 
father delights to rob me of, and, from motives of mere idle egotism, 
is pleased to win to himself, making no use of it but to torment me, 
and ruin the child. My only consolation is, that he spends 
comparatively little of his time at home, and, during the months he 
passes in London or elsewhere, I have a chance of recovering the ground 
I had lost, and overcoming with good the evil he has wrought by his 
wilful mismanagement. But then it is a bitter trial to behold him, on 
his return, doing his utmost to subvert my labours and transform my 
innocent, affectionate, tractable darling into a selfish, disobedient, 
and mischievous boy; thereby preparing the soil for those vices he has 
so successfully cultivated in his own perverted nature. 
</p>
               <p>Happily, there were none of Arthur's `friends' invited to Grassdale 
last autumn: he took himself off to visit some of them instead. I wish 
he would always do so, and I wish his friends were numerous and loving 
enough to keep him amongst them all the year round. Mr. Hargrave, 
considerably to my annoyance, did not go with him; but I think I have 
done with that gentleman at last. 
</p>
               <p>For seven or eight months, he behaved so remarkably well, and managed 
so skilfully too, that I was almost completely off my guard, and was 
really beginning to look upon him as a friend, and even to treat him 
as such, with certain prudent restrictions (which I deemed scarcely 
necessary); when, presuming upon my unsuspecting kindness, he thought 
he might venture to overstep the bounds of decent moderation and 
propriety that had so long retained him. It was on a pleasant evening 
at the close of May: I was wandering in the park, and he, on seeing me 
there as he rode past, made bold to enter and approach me, dismounting 
and leaving his horse at the gate. This was the first time he had 
ventured to come within its inclosure since I had been left alone, 
without the sanction of his mother's or sister's company, or at least 
the excuse of a message from them. But he managed to appear so calm and 
easy, so respectful and self-possessed in his friendliness, that, 
though a little surprised, I was neither alarmed nor offended at the 
unusual liberty, and he walked with me under the ash trees and by the 
water-side, and talked, with considerable animation, good taste, and 
intelligence, on many subjects, before I began to think about getting 
rid of him. Then, after a pause, during which we both stood gazing on 
the calm, blue water; I revolving in my mind the best means of politely 
dismissing my companion, he, no doubt, pondering other matters equally 
alien to the sweet sights and sounds that alone were present to his 
senses,—he suddenly electrified me by beginning, in a peculiar tone, 
low, soft, but perfectly distinct, to pour forth the most unequivocal 
expressions of earnest and passionate love; pleading his cause with all 
the bold yet artful eloquence he could summon to his aid. But I cut 
short his appeal, and repulsed him so determinately, so decidedly, and 
with such a mixture of scornful indignation tempered with cool, 
dispassionate sorrow and pity for his benighted mind, that he withdrew, 
astonished, mortified, and discomforted; and, a few days after, I heard 
that he had departed for London. He returned however in eight or nine 
weeks—and did not entirely keep aloof from me, but comported himself 
in so remarkable a manner that his quick-sighted sister could not fail 
to notice the change. 
</p>
               <p>`What have you done to Walter, Mrs. Huntingdon?' said she one morning, 
when I had called at the Grove, and he had just left the room after 
exchanging a few words of the coldest civility. `He has been so 
extremely ceremonious and stately of late, I can't imagine what it is 
all about, unless you have desperately offended him. Tell me what it 
is, that I may be your mediator, and make you friends again.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have done nothing willingly to offend him,' said I. `If he is 
offended, he can best tell you himself what it is about.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'll ask him,' cried the giddy girl, springing up and putting her head 
out of the window; `he's only in the garden—Walter!' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no, Esther! you will seriously displease me if you do; and I shall 
leave you immediately, and not come again for months—perhaps years. 
</p>
               <p>`Did you call, Esther?' said her brother, approaching the window from 
without. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; I wanted to ask you—' 
</p>
               <p>`Good morning, Esther,' said I, taking her hand and giving it a severe 
squeeze. 
</p>
               <p>`To ask you,' continued she, `to get me a rose for Mrs. Huntingdon.' 
He departed. `Mrs. Huntingdon,' she exclaimed, turning to me and still 
holding me fast by the hand, `I'm quite shocked at you—you're just as 
angry, and distant, and cold as he is: and I'm determined you shall be 
as good friends as ever, before you go. 
</p>
               <p>`Esther, how can you be so rude!' cried Mrs. Hargrave, who was seated 
gravely knitting in her easy chair. `Surely, you never <hi>will</hi>
learn to conduct yourself like a lady!' 
</p>
               <p>`Well mamma, you said, yourself—' But the young lady was silenced by 
the uplifted finger of her mamma, accompanied with a very stern shake 
of the head. 
</p>
               <p>`Isn't she cross?' whispered she to me; but, before I could add my 
share of reproof, Mr. Hargrave reappeared at the window with a 
beautiful moss rose in his hand. 
</p>
               <p>`Here, Esther, I've brought you the rose,' said he, extending it 
towards her. 
</p>
               <p>`Give it her yourself, you blockhead!' cried she, recoiling with a 
spring from between us. 
</p>
               <p>`Mrs. Huntingdon would rather receive it from you,' replied he in a 
very serious tone, but lowering his voice that his mother might not 
hear. His sister took the rose and gave it to me. 
</p>
               <p>`My brother's compliments, Mrs. Huntingdon, and he hopes you and he 
will come to a better understanding by and by.—Will that do, Walter?' 
added the saucy girl, turning to him and putting her arm round his 
neck, as he stood leaning upon the sill of the window—'or should I 
have said that you are sorry you were so touchy? or that you hope she 
will pardon your offence?' 
</p>
               <p>`You silly girl! you don't know what you are talking about,' replied 
he gravely. 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed I don't; for I'm quite in the dark.' 
</p>
               <p>`Now Esther,' interposed Mrs. Hargrave, who, if equally benighted on 
the subject of our estrangement, saw at least that her daughter was 
behaving very improperly, `I must insist upon your leaving the room!' 
</p>
               <p>`Pray don't, Mrs. Hargrave, for I'm going to leave it myself,' said I, 
and immediately made my adieux. 
</p>
               <p>About a week after, Mr. Hargrave brought his sister to see me. He 
conducted himself, at first, with his usual cold, distant, 
half-stately, half-melancholy, altogether injured air; but Esther made 
no remark upon it this time; she had evidently been schooled into 
better manners. She talked to me, and laughed and romped with little 
Arthur, her loved and loving playmate. He, somewhat to my discomfort, 
enticed her from the room to have a run in the hall; and, thence, into 
the garden. I got up to stir the fire. Mr. Hargrave asked if I felt 
cold, and shut the doors very unseasonable piece of officiousness, for 
I had meditated following the noisy playfellows, if they did not 
speedily return. He then took the liberty of walking up to the fire 
himself, and asking me if I were aware that Mr. Huntingdon was now at 
the seat of Lord Lowborough, and likely to continue there some time. 
</p>
               <p>`No; but it's no matter,' I answered carelessly; and if my cheek glowed 
like fire, it was rather at the question than the information it 
conveyed. 
</p>
               <p>`You don't object to it?' he said. 
</p>
               <p>`Not at all, if Lord Lowborough likes his company.' 
</p>
               <p>`You have no love left for him, then?' 
</p>
               <p>`Not the least.' 
</p>
               <p>`I knew that—knew you were too high-minded and pure in your own nature 
to continue to regard one so utterly false and polluted, with any 
feelings but those of indignation and scornful abhorrence!' 
</p>
               <p>`Is he not your friend?' said I, turning my eyes from the fire to his 
face, with perhaps a slight touch of those feelings he assigned to 
another. 
</p>
               <p>`He <hi>was,'</hi> replied he, with the same calm gravity as before, `but 
do not wrong me by supposing that I could continue my friendship and 
esteem to a man who could so infamously—so impiously forsake and 
injure one so transcendently—well, I won't speak of it. But tell me, 
do you never think of revenge?' 
</p>
               <p>`Revenge! No—what good would that do?—it would make him no better, 
and me no happier.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't know how to talk to you, Mrs. Huntingdon,' said he smiling; 
`you are only half a woman—your nature must be half human, half 
angelic. Such goodness overawes me; I don't know what to make of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then sir, I fear you must be very much worse than you should be, if 
I, a mere ordinary mortal, am by your own confession, so vastly your 
superior;—and since there exists so little sympathy between us, I 
think we had better each look out for some more congenial companion.' 
And forthwith moving to the window, I began to look out for my little 
son and his gay young friend. 
</p>
               <p>`No, I am the ordinary mortal, I maintain,' replied Mr. Hargrave. I 
will not allow myself to be worse than my fellows; but you Madam—I 
equally maintain there is nobody like you. But are you happy?' he asked 
in a serious tone. 
</p>
               <p>`As happy as some others, I suppose.' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you as happy as you desire to be?' 
</p>
               <p>`No one is so blest as that comes to, on this side eternity.' 
</p>
               <p>`One thing I know,' returned he, with a deep, sad sigh; `you are 
immeasurably happier than I am.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am very sorry for you, then,' I could not help replying. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you <hi>indeed</hi>?—No—for if you were, you would be glad to 
relieve me.' 
</p>
               <p>`And so I should, if I could do so, without injuring myself or any 
other.' 
</p>
               <p>`And can you suppose that I should wish you to injure yourself?—No; 
on the contrary, it is your own happiness I long for more than mine. 
You are miserable now, Mrs. Huntingdon,' continued he, looking me 
boldly in the face. `You do not complain, but I send feel—and know 
that you are miserable and must remain so, as long as you keep those 
walls of impenetrable ice about your still warm and palpitating 
heart;— and I am miserable too. Deign to smile on me, and I am happy: 
trust me, and you shall be happy also, for if you <hi>are</hi> a woman, 
I can make you sound I <hi>will</hi> do it in spite of yourself!' he 
muttered between his teeth, `and as for others, the question is between 
ourselves alone: you cannot injure your husband, you know; and no one 
else has any concern in the matter.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have a son, Mr. Hargrave, and you have a mother,' said I, retiring 
from the window, whither he had followed me. 
</p>
               <p>`They need not know,' he began, but before anything more could be said 
on either side, Esther and Arthur re-entered the room. The former 
glanced at Walter's flushed, excited countenance, and then at mined 
little flushed and excited too, I dare say, though from far different 
causes. She must have thought we had been quarrelling desperately, and 
was evidently perplexed and disturbed at the circumstance; but she was 
too polite, or too much afraid of her brother's anger to refer to it. 
She seated herself on the sofa, and putting back her bright, golden 
ringlets, that Were scattered in wild profusion over her face, she 
immediately began to talk about the garden and her little playfellow, 
and continued to chatter away in her usual strain till her brother 
summoned her to depart. 
</p>
               <p>`If I have spoken too warmly, forgive me,' he murmured on taking his 
leave, `or I shall never forgive myself.' 
</p>
               <p>Esther smiled and glanced at me: I merely bowed, and her countenance 
fell. She thought it a poor return for Walter's generous concession, 
and was disappointed in her friend. Poor child, she little knows the 
world she lives in! 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Hargrave had not an opportunity of meeting me again in private for 
several weeks after this; but when he did meet me, there was less of 
pride and more of touching melancholy in his manner than before. Oh, 
<hi>how</hi> he annoyed me! I was obliged, at last almost entirely to 
remit my visits to the Grove, at the expense of deeply offending Mrs. 
Hargrave and seriously afflicting poor Esther, who really values my 
society—for want of better, and who ought not to suffer for the fault 
of her brother. But that indefatigable foe was not yet vanquished: `he 
seemed to be always on the watch. I frequently saw him riding 
lingeringly past the premises, looking searchingly round him as he 
went—or if I did not, Rachel did. That sharp-sighted woman soon 
guessed how matters stood between us, and descrying the enemy's 
movements from her elevation at the nursery window, she would give me 
a quiet intimation, if she saw me preparing for a walk when she had 
reason to believe he was about, or to think it likely that he would 
meet or overtake me in the way I meant to traverse. I would then defer 
my ramble, or confine myself for that day to the park and gardens—or 
if the proposed excursion was a matter of importance, such as a visit 
to the sick or afflicted, I would take Rachel with me, and then I was 
never molested. 
</p>
               <p>But one mild, sunshiny day, early in November, I had ventured forth 
alone, to visit the village school and a few of the poor tenants, and 
on my return, I was alarmed at the clatter of a horse's feet behind me 
approaching at a rapid, steady trot. There was no stile or gap at hand, 
by which I could escape into the fields: so I walked quietly on, saying 
to myself— 
</p>
               <p>`It may not be he after all; and if it is, and if he <hi>do</hi> annoy 
me—it shall be for the last time—I am determined, if there be power 
in words and looks against cool impudence and mawkish sentimentality 
so inexhaustible as his.' 
</p>
               <p>The horse soon overtook me, and was reined up close beside me. It 
<hi>was</hi> Mr. Hargrave. He greeted me with a smile intended to be soft 
and melancholy, but his triumphant satisfaction at having caught me at 
last, so shone through, that it was quite a failure. After briefly 
answering his salutation and inquiring after the ladies at the Grove, 
I turned away and walked on; but he followed, and kept his horse at my 
side: it was evident he intended to be my companion all the way. 
</p>
               <p>`Well! I don't much care. If you want another rebuff, take it—and 
welcome,' was my inward remark. `Now sir, what next?' 
</p>
               <p>This question, though unspoken, was not long unanswered: after a few 
passing observations upon indifferent subjects, he began, in solemn 
tones, the following appeal to my humanity: 
</p>
               <p>`It will be four years next April since I first saw you, Mrs. 
Huntingdon,—you may have forgotten the circumstance, but I never 
can—I admired you then, most deeply, but I dared not love you: in the 
following autumn, I saw so much of your perfections that I could not 
fail to love you, though I dared not shew it. For upwards of three 
years, I have endured a perfect martyrdom. From the anguish of 
suppressed emotions, intense and fruitless longings, silent sorrow, 
crushed hopes, and trampled affections,—I have suffered more than I 
can tell, or you imagine—and you were the cause of it—and not, 
altogether, the innocent cause. My youth is wasting away; my prospects 
are darkened; my life is a desolate blank; I have no rest day or night: 
I am become a burden to myself and others;and you might save me by a 
words glance, and will not do it.—Is this right?' 
</p>
               <p>`In the first place, I don't believe you,' answered I: `in the second, 
if you will be such a fool, I can't hinder it.' 
</p>
               <p>`If you affect,' replied he earnestly, `to regard as folly, the best, 
the strongest, the most godlike impulses of our nature,—I don't 
believe <hi>you</hi>—I know you are not the heartless, icy being you 
pretend to bayou had a heart once, and you gave it to your husband. 
When you found him utterly unworthy of the treasure you reclaimed 
it;—and you will not <hi>pretend</hi> that you loved that sensual, 
earthly minded profligate so deeply, so devotedly that you can never 
love another?—I know that there are feelings in your nature that have 
never yet been called forth—I know, too, that in your present 
neglected, lonely state you are, and <hi>must</hi> be miserable. You have 
it in your power to raise two human beings from a state of actual 
suffering to such unspeakable beatitude as only generous, noble 
self-forgetting love can give (for you <hi>can</hi> love me if you will; 
you may tell me that you scorn and detest me, but—since you have set 
me the example of plain speaking—I will answer that <hi>I do not 
believe you!),</hi> but you will not do it! you choose rather to leave 
us miserable; and you coolly tell me it is the will of God that we 
should remain so. <hi>You</hi> may call this religion, but I call it wild 
fanaticism!' 
</p>
               <p>`There is another life both for you and for me,' said I. `If it be the 
will of—God that we should sow in tears, now, it is only that we may 
reap in joy, hereafter.* It is His will that we should not injure 
others by the gratification of our own earthly passions; and you have 
a mother, and sisters, and friends, who would be seriously injured by 
your disgrace; and I too have friends, whose peace of mind shall never 
be sacrificed to my enjoyment—or yours either, with my consent—and 
if I were alone in the world, I have still my God and my religion,* and 
I would sooner die than disgrace my calling and break my faith with 
Heaven to obtain a few brief years of false and fleeting 
happiness—happiness sure to end in misery, even here—for myself or 
any other!' 
</p>
               <p>`There need be no disgrace—no misery or sacrifice in any quarter,' 
persisted he. `I do not ask you to leave your home or defy the world's 
opinion. `—But I need not repeat all his arguments. I refuted them to 
the best of my power; but that power was provokingly small, at the 
moment, for I was too much flurried with indignation—and even 
shame—that he should thus dare to address me, to retain sufficient 
command of thought and language to enable me adequately to contend 
against his powerful sophistries. Finding, however, that he could not 
be silenced by reason, and even covertly exulted in his seeming 
advantage, and ventured to deride those assertions I had not the 
coolness to prove, I changed my course and tried another plan. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you really love me?' said I seriously, pausing and looking him 
calmly in the face. 
</p>
               <p>`Do I love you!' cried he. 
</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>`Truly?'</hi> I demanded. 
</p>
               <p>His countenance brightened; he thought his triumph was at hand. He 
commenced a passionate protestation of the truth and fervour of his 
attachment which I cut short by another question:— 
</p>
               <p>`But is it not a selfish love?—have you enough disinterested affection 
to enable you to sacrifice your own pleasure to mine?' 
</p>
               <p>`I would give my life to serve you.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't want your life—but have you enough real sympathy for my 
afflictions to induce you to make an effort to relieve them, at the 
risk of a little discomfort to yourself?' 
</p>
               <p>`Try me, and see!' 
</p>
               <p>`If you have—<hi>never mention this subject again</hi>. You cannot recur 
to it in any way, without doubling the weight of those sufferings you 
so feelingly deplore. I have nothing left me but the solace of a good 
conscience and a hopeful trust in Heaven, and you labour continually 
to rob me of these. If you persist, I must regard you as my deadliest 
foe.' 
</p>
               <p>`But hear me a moment—' 
</p>
               <p>`No, sir! you said you would give your life to serve me: I only ask 
your <hi>silence</hi> on one particular point. I have spoken plainly; and 
what I say I mean. If you torment me in this way any more, I must 
conclude that your protestations are entirely false, and that you hate 
me in your heart as fervently as you profess to love me!' 
</p>
               <p>He bit his lip and bent his eyes upon the ground in silence for a 
while. 
</p>
               <p>`Then I must leave you,' said he at length, looking steadily upon me, 
as if with the last hope of detecting some token of irrepressible 
anguish or dismay awakened by those solemn words. `I must leave you. 
I cannot live here, and be for ever silent on the all-absorbing subject 
of my thoughts and wishes.' 
</p>
               <p>`Formerly, I believe, you spent but little of your time at home,' I 
answered: `it will do you no harm to absent yourself again, for a 
while—if that be really necessary.' 
</p>
               <p>`If that be really <hi>possible</hi>,' he muttered—'and can you bid me 
go so coolly? Do you really wish it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Most certainly I do. If you cannot see me without tormenting me as you 
have lately done, I would gladly say farewell and never see you more. 
</p>
               <p>He made no answer, but, bending from his horse, held out his hand 
towards me. I looked up at his face, and saw, therein, such a look of 
genuine agony of soul that, whether bitter disappointment, or wounded 
pride, or lingering love, or burning wrath were uppermost, I could not 
hesitate to put my hand in his as frankly as if I bade a friend 
farewell. He grasped it very hard, and immediately put spurs to his 
horse and galloped away. Very soon after, I learned that he was gone 
to Paris, where he still is, and the longer he stays there the better 
for me. 
</p>
               <p>I thank God for this deliverance!

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII</head>
               <head>THE INJURED MAN</head>
               <p>December 20th, 1826.—The fifth anniversary of my wedding day, and I 
trust, the last I shall spend under this roof. My resolution is formed, 
my plan concocted, and already partly put in execution. My conscience 
does not blame me, but while the purpose ripens, let me beguile a few 
of these long winter evenings in stating the case for my own 
satisfaction—dreary amusement enough, but having the air of a useful 
occupation, and being pursued as a task, it will suit me better than 
a lighter one. 
</p>
               <p>In September, quiet Grassdale was again alive with a party of ladies 
and gentlemen (so called) consisting of the same individuals as those 
invited the year before last, with the addition of two or three others, 
among whom were Mrs. Hargrave and her younger daughter. The gentlemen 
and Lady Lowborough were invited for the pleasure and convenience of 
the host; the other ladies, I suppose for the sake of appearances, and 
to keep me in check and make me discreet and civil in my demeanour. But 
the ladies stayed only three weeks, the gentlemen, with two exceptions, 
above two months, for their hospitable entertainer was loath to part 
with them and be left alone with his bright intellect, his stainless 
conscience, and his loved and loving wife. 
</p>
               <p>On the day of Lady Lowborough's arrival, I followed her into her 
chamber, and plainly told her that, if I found reason to believe that 
she still continued her criminal connection with Mr. Huntingdon, I 
should think it my absolute duty to inform her husband of the 
circumstance—or awaken his suspicions at least—however painful it 
might be, or however dreadful the consequences. She was startled at 
first, by the declaration, so unexpected, and so determinately yet 
calmly delivered; but rallying in a moment, she coolly replied that if 
I saw anything at all reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct, she 
would freely give me leave to tell his lordship all about it. Willing 
to be satisfied with this, I left her; and certainly I saw nothing 
thenceforth particularly reprehensible or suspicious in her demeanour 
towards her host; but then I had the other guests to attend to, and I 
did not watch them narrowly—for to confess the truth, I <hi>feared</hi>
to see anything between them. I no longer regarded it as any concern 
of mine, and if it was my duty to enlighten Lord Lowborough, it was a 
painful duty, and I dreaded to be called to perform it. 
</p>
               <p>But my fears were brought to an end, in a manner I had not anticipated. 
One evening, about a fortnight after the visitors' arrival, I had 
retired into the library to snatch a few minutes' respite from forced 
cheerfulness and wearisome discourse—for after so long a period of 
seclusion, dreary indeed, as I had often found it, I could not always 
bear to be doing violence to my feelings, and goading my powers to 
talk, and smile and listen, and play the attentive hostess—or even the 
cheerful friend—I had just ensconced myself within the bow of the 
window, and was looking out upon the west where the darkening hills 
rose sharply defined against the clear amber light of evening, that 
gradually blended and faded away into the pure, pale blue of the upper 
sky, where one bright star was shining through, as if to promise—When 
that dying light is gone, the world will not be left in darkness, and 
they who trust in God—whose minds are unbeclouded by the mists of 
unbelief and sin, are never wholly comfortless,”—when I heard a 
hurried step approaching, and Lord Lowborough entered—his room was 
still his favourite resort. He flung the door to with unusual violence, 
and cast his hat aside regardless where it fell. What could be the 
matter with him? His face was ghastly pale; his eyes were fixed upon 
the ground; his teeth clenched; his forehead glistened with the dews 
of agony. It was plain he knew his wrongs at last! 
</p>
               <p>Unconscious of my presence, he began to pace the room in a state of 
fearful agitation, violently wringing his hands and uttering low groans 
or incoherent ejaculations. I made a movement to let him know that he 
was not alone; but he was too preoccupied to notice it. Perhaps, while 
his back was towards me, I might cross the room and slip away 
unobserved; I rose to make the attempt, but then he perceived me. He 
started and stood still a moment; then wiped his streaming forehead, 
and advancing towards me, with a kind of unnatural composure, said in 
a deep, almost sepulchral tone— 
</p>
               <p>`Mrs. Huntingdon, I must leave you to-morrow.' 
</p>
               <p>`To-morrow!' I repeated, `I do not ask the cause.' 
</p>
               <p>`You know it then—and you can be so calm!' said he, surveying me with 
profound astonishment, not unmingled with a kind of resentful 
bitterness, as it appeared to me. 
</p>
               <p>`I have so long been aware of—' I paused in time, and added, `of my 
husband's character, that nothing shocks me.' 
</p>
               <p>`But <hi>this</hi>—how long have you been aware of this?' demanded he, 
laying his clenched hand on the table beside him, and looking me keenly 
and fixedly in the face. 
</p>
               <p>I felt like a criminal. 
</p>
               <p>`Not long,' I answered. 
</p>
               <p>`You knew it!' cried he with bitter vehemence—and you did not tell me! 
You helped to deceive me!' 
</p>
               <p>`My lord, I did <hi>not</hi> help to deceive you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then why did you not tell me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Because, I knew it would be painful to you—I hoped she would return 
to her duty, and then there would be no need to harrow your feelings 
with such 
</p>
               <p>`O God! how long has this been going on? how long has it been, Mrs. 
Huntingdon?—Tell me—I MUST know!' he exclaimed with intense and 
fearful eagerness. 
</p>
               <p>`Two years, I believe.' 
</p>
               <p>`Great Heaven! and she has duped me all this time!' He turned away with 
a suppressed groan of agony, and paced the room again, in a paroxysm 
of renewed agitation. My heart smote me; but I would try to console 
him, though I knew not how to attempt it. 
</p>
               <p>`She is a wicked woman,' I said. `She has basely deceived and betrayed 
you. She is as little worthy of your regret as she was of your 
affection. Let her injure you no farther: abstract yourself from her, 
and stand alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`And you, Madam,' said he sternly, arresting his walk and turning round 
upon me—`you have injured me too, by this ungenerous concealment!' 
</p>
               <p>There was a sudden revulsion in my feelings. Something rose within me, 
and urged me to resent this harsh return for my heartfelt sympathy, and 
defend myself with answering severity. Happily, I did not yield to the 
impulse. I saw his anguish as, suddenly smiting his forehead, he turned 
abruptly to the window, and, looking upward at the placid sky, murmured 
passionately, `O God, that I might die!'—and felt that to add one drop 
of bitterness to that already overflowing cup, would be ungenerous 
indeed. And yet, I fear there was more coldness than gentleness in the 
quiet tone of my reply:— 
</p>
               <p>`I might offer many excuses that some would admit to be valid, but I 
will not attempt to enumerate them—' 
</p>
               <p>`I know them,' said he hastily, `you would say that it was no business 
of yours—that I ought to have taken care of myself—that if my own 
blindness has led me into this pit of hell, I have no right to blame 
another for giving me credit for a larger amount of sagacity than I 
possessed—' 
</p>
               <p>`I confess I was wrong,' continued I, without regarding this bitter 
interruption; `but whether want of courage or mistaken kindness was the 
cause of my error, I think you blame me too severely. I told Lady 
Lowborough two weeks ago, the very hour she came, that I should 
certainly think it my duty to inform you if she continued to deceive 
you: she gave me full liberty to do so if I should see anything 
reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct—I have seen nothing; and 
I trusted she had altered her course. 
</p>
               <p>He continued gazing from the window while I spoke, and did not answer, 
but, stung by the recollections my words awakened, stamped his foot 
upon the floor, ground his teeth, and corrugated his brow, like one 
under the influence of acute physical pain. 
</p>
               <p>`It was wrong—it was wrong!' he muttered, at length. `Nothing can 
excuse it—nothing can atone for it,—for nothing can recall those 
years of cursed credulity—nothing obliterate them!—nothing, nothing!' 
he repeated in a whisper whose despairing bitterness precluded all 
resentment. 
</p>
               <p>`When I put the case to myself, I own it <hi>was</hi> wrong,' I answered; 
`but I can only now regret that I did not see it in this light before, 
and that, as you say, nothing can recall the past.' 
</p>
               <p>Something in my voice or in the spirit of this answer seemed to alter 
his mood. Turning towards me and attentively surveying my face by the 
dim light, he said in a milder tone than he had yet employed,— 
</p>
               <p>`You too have suffered, I suppose.' 
</p>
               <p>`I suffered much, at first.' 
</p>
               <p>`When was that?' 
</p>
               <p>`Two years ago; and two years hence you will be as calm as I am 
now,—and far, far happier, I trust, for you are a man, and free to act 
as you please.' 
</p>
               <p>Something like a smile, but a <hi>very</hi> bitter one, crossed his face 
for a moment. 
</p>
               <p>`You have not been happy lately?' he said with a kind of effort to 
regain composure, and a determination to waive the further discussion 
of his own calamity. 
</p>
               <p>`Happy!' I repeated, almost provoked at such a question.—`Could I be 
so, with such a husband?' 
</p>
               <p>`I have noticed a change in your appearance since the first years of 
your marriage,' pursued he: `I observed it too that infernal demon,' 
he muttered between his teeth— `and he said it was your own sour 
temper that was eating away your bloom: it was making you old and ugly 
before your time, and had already made his fire-side as comfortless as 
a convent cell.—You smile Mrs. Huntingdon—nothing moves you. I wish 
my nature were as calm as yours!' 
</p>
               <p>`My nature was not originally calm,' said I: `I have learned to appear 
so by dint of hard lessons, and many repeated efforts. 
</p>
               <p>At this juncture Mr. Hattersley burst into the room. 
</p>
               <p>`Hallow, Lowborough!' he began.— `Oh! I beg your pardon,' he exclaimed 
on seeing me; `I didn't know it was a tête-a-tête. Cheer 
up, man!' he continued, giving Lord Lowborough a thump on the back, 
which caused the latter to recoil from him with looks of ineffable 
disgust and irritation. `Come, I want to speak with you a bit.' 
</p>
               <p>`Speak, then.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I'm not sure it would be quite agreeable to the lady, what I have 
to say.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then it would not be agreeable to me,' said his lordship, turning to 
leave the room. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, it would,' cried the other, following him into the hall. `If 
you've the heart of a man it would be the very ticket for you. It's 
just this, my lad,' he continued, rather lowering his voice, but not 
enough to prevent me from hearing every word he said, though the 
half-closed door stood between us: `I think you're an ill-used 
man—nay, now, don't flare up—I don't want to offend you: it's only 
my rough way of talking. I must speak right out you <hi>know,</hi> or 
else not at all;—and I'm come—stop now! let me explain—I'm come to 
offer you my services, for though Huntingdon is my friend, he's a 
devilish scamp as we all know, and I'll be <hi>your</hi> friend for the 
nonce. I know what it is you want, to make matters straight: it's just 
to exchange a shot with him, and then you'll feel yourself all right 
again; and if an accident happens—why, that'll be all right too, I 
dare say, to a desperate fellow like you.—me now! give me your hand, 
and don't look so black upon it. Name time and place, and I'll manage 
the rest.' 
</p>
               <p>`That,' answered the more low, deliberate voice of Lord Lowborough, `is 
just the remedy my own heart—or the devil within it, suggested—to 
meet him, and <hi>not to sever without blood.</hi> Whether I or he should 
fall—or both, it would be an <hi>inexpressible</hi> relief to me, 
if—' 
</p>
               <p>`Just so! Well then—' 
</p>
               <p>`No!' exclaimed his lordship with deep, determined emphasis. `Though 
I hate him from my heart, and should rejoice at any calamity that could 
befall him—I'll leave him to God; and though I abhor my own life, I'll 
leave that too, to Him that gave' 
</p>
               <p>`But you see in this case,' pleaded Hattersley— 
</p>
               <p>`I'll not hear you!' exclaimed his companion, hastily turning away. 
`Not another word! I've enough to do against the fiend within me.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you're a white livered fool, and I wash my hands of you,' 
grumbled the tempter as he swung himself round and departed. 
</p>
               <p>`Right, right, Lord Lowborough!' cried I, darting out and clasping his 
burning hand, as he was moving away to the stairs. `I begin to think 
the world is not worthy of you!' 
</p>
               <p>Not understanding this sudden ebullition, he turned upon me with a 
stare of gloomy, bewildered amazement that made me ashamed of the 
impulse to which I had yielded; but soon a more humanized expression 
dawned upon his countenance, and, before I could withdraw my hand, he 
pressed it kindly, while a gleam of genuine feeling flashed from his 
eyes as he murmured,— 
</p>
               <p>`God help us both!' 
</p>
               <p>`Amen!' responded I; and we parted. 
</p>
               <p>I returned to the drawing-room, where, doubtless, my presence would be 
expected by most, desired by one or two. In the ante-room was Mr. 
Hattersley, railing against Lord Lowborough's poltroonery before a 
select audience, viz. Mr. Huntingdon, who was lounging against the 
table exulting in his own treacherous villainy and laughing his victim 
to scorn, and Mr. Grimsby, standing by, quietly rubbing his hands and 
chuckling with fiendish satisfaction. At the glance I gave them in 
passing, Hattersley stopped short in his animadversions and stared like 
a bull calf, Grimsby glowered upon me with a leer of malignant 
ferocity, and my husband muttered a coarse and brutal malediction. 
</p>
               <p>In the drawing-room I found Lady Lowborough, evidently in no very 
enviable state of mind, and struggling hard to conceal her discomposure 
by an overstrained affectation of unusual cheerfulness and vivacity, 
very uncalled for under the circumstances, for she had herself given 
the company to understand that her husband had received unpleasant 
intelligence from home, which necessitated his immediate departure, and 
that he had suffered it so to bother his mind that it had brought on 
a bilious headache, owing to which and the preparations he judged 
necessary to hasten his departure, she believed they would not have the 
pleasure of seeing him to-night. However, she asserted, it was only a 
business concern, and so she did not intend it should trouble 
<hi>her.</hi> She was just saying this as I entered, and she darted upon 
me such a glance of hardihood and defiance as at once astonished and 
revolted me. 
</p>
               <p>`But I <hi>am</hi> troubled,' continued she, `and vexed too, for I think 
it my duty to accompany his lordship, and of course I am very sorry to 
part with all my kind friends, so unexpectedly and so soon.' 
</p>
               <p>`And yet, Annabella,' said Esther, who was sitting beside her, `I never 
saw you in better spirits in my life.' 
</p>
               <p>`Precisely so, my love; because I wish to make the best of your 
society, since it appears this is to be the last night I am to enjoy 
it, till Heaven knows when; and I wish to leave a good impression on 
you all,'—she glanced round, and seeing her aunt's eye fixed upon her, 
rather too scrutinizingly, as she probably thought, she started up and 
continued,— `to which end I'll give you a song-hall I, aunt? shall I, 
Mrs. Huntingdon? shall I, ladies and gentlemen—all?—Very well, I'll 
do my best to amuse you.' 
</p>
               <p>She and Lord Lowborough occupied the apartments next to mine. I know 
not how <hi>she</hi> passed the night, but I lay awake the greater part 
of it listening to his heavy step pacing monotonously up and down his 
dressing-room, which was nearest my chamber. Once I heard him pause and 
throw something out of the window, with a passionate ejaculation; and 
in the morning, after they were gone, a keen-bladed clasp-knife was 
found on the grass-plot below; a razor, likewise was snapped in two and 
thrust deep into the cinders of the grate, but partially corroded by 
the decaying embers. So strong had been the temptation to end his 
miserable life, so determined his resolution to resist it. 
</p>
               <p>My heart bled for him as I lay listening to that ceaseless tread. 
Hitherto, I had thought too much of myself, too little of him: now I 
forgot my own afflictions, and thought only of his—of the ardent 
affection so miserably wasted, the fond faith so cruelly betrayed, 
the—no, I will not attempt to enumerate his wrongs,—but I hated his 
wife and my husband more intensely than ever, and not for my sake, but 
for his. 
</p>
               <p>`That man,' I thought, `is an object of scorn to his friends and the 
nice-judging world. The false wife and the treacherous friend who have 
wronged him are not so despised and degraded as he; and his refusal to 
avenge his wrongs has removed him yet farther beyond the range of 
sympathy, and blackened his name with a deeper disgrace. He knows this; 
and it doubles his burden of wo. He sees the injustice of it, but he 
cannot bear up against it; he lacks that sustaining power of 
self-esteem which leads a man, exulting in his own integrity, to defy 
the malice of traducing foes and give them scorn for scorn—or, better 
still, which raises him above earth's foul and turbulent vapours, to 
repose in Heaven's eternal sunshine. He knows that God is just, but 
cannot see His justice now: he knows this life is short, and yet death 
seems insufferably far away; he believes there is a future state, but 
so absorbing is the agony of this that he cannot realize its rapturous 
repose. He can but bow his head to the storm, and cling, blindly, 
despairingly, to what he knows to be right. Like the shipwrecked 
mariner cleaving to a raft, blinded, deafened, bewildered, he feels the 
waves sweep over him, and sees no prospect of escape; and yet he knows 
he has no hope but this, and still, while life and sense remain, 
concentrates all his energies to keep it. Oh, that I had a friend's 
right to comfort him, and tell him that I never esteemed him so highly 
as I do this night!' 
</p>
               <p>They departed early in the morning before any one else was down, except 
myself, and just as I was leaving my room, Lord Lowborough was 
descending to take his place in the carriage where his lady was already 
ensconced; and Arthur (or Mr. Huntingdon as I prefer calling him, for 
the other is my child's name) had the gratuitous insolence to come out 
in his dressing-gown to bid his `friend' good bye. 
</p>
               <p>`What, going already, Lowborough?' said he. `Well, good morning.' He 
smilingly offered his hand. 
</p>
               <p>I think the other would have knocked him down, had he not instinctively 
started back before that bony fist quivering with rage and clenched 
till the knuckles gleamed white and glistening through the skin. 
Looking upon him with a countenance livid with furious hate, Lord 
Lowborough muttered between his closed teeth, a deadly execration he 
would not have uttered had he been calm enough to choose his words, and 
departed. 
</p>
               <p>`I call that an unchristian spirit now,' said the villain. `But I'd 
never give up an old friend for the sake of a wife. You may have mine 
if you like, and I call that handsome—I <hi>can</hi> do no more than 
offer restitution, can I?' 
</p>
               <p>But Lowborough had gained the bottom of the stairs, and was now 
crossing the hall; and Mr. Huntingdon, leaning over the banisters, 
called out,—`Give my love to Annabella!—and I wish you both a happy 
journey,' and withdrew laughing to his chamber. 
</p>
               <p>He subsequently expressed himself rather glad she was gone: `She was 
so deuced imperious and exacting,' said he: `now I shall be my own man 
again, and feel rather more at my ease.' 
</p>
               <p>I know nothing more of Lord Lowborough's subsequent proceedings but 
what I have heard from Milicent, who, though she is ignorant of the 
cause of his separation from her cousin, has informed me that such is 
the case; that they keep entirely separate establishments; that she 
leads a gay, dashing life in town and country, while he lives in strict 
seclusion at his old castle in the north. There are two children, both 
of whom he keeps under his own protection. The son and heir is a 
promising child nearly the age of my Arthur, and no doubt a source of 
some hope and comfort to his father; but the other, a little girl 
between one and two, with blue eyes and light auburn hair, he probably 
keeps from conscientious motives alone, thinking it wrong to abandon 
her to the teaching and example of such a woman as her mother. That 
mother never loved children, and has so little natural affection for 
her own that I question whether she will not regard it as a relief to 
be thus entirely separated from them, and delivered from the trouble 
and responsibility of their charge. 
</p>
               <p>Not many days after the departure of Lord and Lady Lowborough, the rest 
of the ladies withdrew the light of their presence from Grassdale. 
Perhaps they might have stayed longer, but neither host nor hostess 
pressed them to prolong their visit—in fact, the former showed too 
plainly that he should be glad to get rid of them;—and Mrs. Hargrave 
retired with her daughters and her grand-children (there are three of 
them now) to the Grove. But the gentlemen remained: Mr. Huntingdon, as 
I intimated before, was determined to keep them as long as he could; 
and, being thus delivered from restraint, they gave a loose to all 
their innate madness, folly, and brutality, and made the house night 
after night one scene of riot, uproar, and confusion. Who among them 
behaved the worst, or who the best, I can not distinctly say; for, from 
the moment I discovered how things would be, I formed the resolution 
of retreating upstairs or locking myself into the library the instant 
I withdrew from the dining-room, and not coming near them again till 
breakfast;—but this I must say for Mr. Hargrave, that from all <hi>I </hi> could see of him, he was a model of decency, sobriety, and 
gentlemanly manners <hi>in comparison</hi> with the rest. 
</p>
               <p>He did not join the party till a week or ten days after the arrival of 
the other guests; for he was still on the continent when they came, and 
I cherished the hope that he would not accept the invitation. Accept 
it he did, however, but his conduct towards me, for the first few 
weeks, was exactly what I should have wished it to be—perfectly civil 
and respectful without any affectation of despondency or dejection, and 
sufficiently distant without haughtiness, or any of such remarkable 
stiffness or iciness or demeanour as might be calculated to disturb or 
puzzle his sister, or call forth the investigation of his mother.

            <div xml:id="c3.39" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX</head>
               <head>A SCHEME OF ESCAPE</head>
               <p>My greatest source of uneasiness, in this time of trial, was my son, 
whom his father and his father's friends delighted to encourage in all 
the embryo vices a little child can show, and to instruct in all the 
evil habits he could acquire in a word, to `make a man of him' was one 
of their staple amusements; and I need say no more to justify my alarm 
on his account, and my determination to deliver him at any hazard from 
the hands of such instructors. I first attempted to keep him always 
with me or in the nursery, and gave Rachel particular injunctions never 
to let him come down to dessert as long as these `gentlemen' stayed; 
but it was no use; these orders were immediately countermanded and 
over-ruled by his father: he was not going to have the little fellow 
moped to death between an old nurse and a cursed fool of a mother. So 
the little fellow came down every evening, in spite of his cross mamma, 
and learnt to tipple wine like papa, to swear like Mr. Hattersley, and 
to have his own way like a man, and sent mamma to the devil when she 
tried to prevent him. To see such things done with the roguish naivete 
of that pretty little child and hear such things spoken by that small 
infantile voice, was as peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll to 
them as it was inexpressibly distressing and painful to me; and when 
he had set the table in a roar,' he would look round delightedly upon 
them all, and add his shrill laugh to theirs. But if that beaming blue 
eye rested on me, its light would vanish for a moment, and he would 
say, in some concern,—`Mamma, why don't <hi>you</hi> laugh? Make her 
laugh, papa—she never will.' 
</p>
               <p>Hence, was I obliged to stay among these human brutes, watching an 
opportunity to get my child away from them, instead of leaving them 
immediately after the removal of the cloth, as I should always 
otherwise have done. He was never willing to go, and I frequently had 
to carry him away by force; for which he thought me very cruel and 
unjust; and sometimes his father would insist upon my letting him 
remain;—and then, 
I would leave him to his kind friends, and retire to indulge my 
bitterness and despair alone or to rack my brains for a remedy to this 
great evil. 
</p>
               <p>But here again, I must do Mr. Hargrave the justice to acknowledge that 
I never saw <hi>him</hi> laugh at the child's misdemeanours, nor heard 
him utter a word of encouragement to his aspirations after manly 
accomplishments. But when anything very extraordinary was said or done 
by the infant profligate, I noticed, at times, a peculiar expression 
in his face, that I could neither interpret nor defined slight 
twitching about the muscles of the mouths sudden flash in the eye, as 
he darted a sudden glance at the child and then at me; and then, I 
could fancy there arose a gleam of hard, keen, sombre satisfaction in 
his countenance at the look of impotent wrath and anguish he was too 
certain to behold in mine. But on one occasion, when Arthur had been 
behaving particularly ill, and Mr. Huntingdon and his guests had been 
particularly provoking and insulting to me in their encouragement of 
him, and I particularly anxious to get him out of the room, and on the 
very point of demeaning myself by a burst of uncontrollable 
passion—Mr. Hargrave suddenly rose from his seat, with an aspect of 
stern determination, lifted the child from his father's knee, where he 
was sitting half tipsy, cocking his head and laughing at me, and 
execrating me with words he little knew the meaning of,—handed him out 
of the room, and setting him down in the hall, held the door open for 
me, gravely bowed as I withdrew, and closed it after me. I heard high 
words exchanged between him and his already half-inebriated host as I 
departed, leading away my bewildered and disconcerted boy, 
</p>
               <p>But this should not continue; my child must not be abandoned to this 
corruption: better far that he should live in poverty and obscurity 
with a fugitive mother, than in luxury and affluence with such a 
father. These guests might not be with us long, but they would return 
again; and he, the most injurious of the whole, his child's worst 
enemy, would still remain. I could endure it for myself, but for my son 
it must be borne no longer: the world's opinion and the feelings of my 
friends must be alike unheeded here, at least, alike unable to deter 
me from my duty. But where should I find an asylum, and how obtain 
subsistence for us both? Oh, I would take my precious charge at early 
dawn, take the coach to M—, flee to the port of 
</p>
               <p>     cross the Atlantic, and seek a quiet, humble home in New England, 
where I would support myself and him by the labour of my hands. The 
palette and the easel, my darling playmates once, must be my sober 
toil-fellows now. But was I sufficiently skilful as an artist to obtain 
my livelihood in a strange land, without friends and without 
recommendation? No; I must wait a little; I must labour hard to improve 
my talent and to produce something worth while as a specimen of my 
powers, something to speak favourably for me, whether as an actual 
painter or a teacher. Brilliant success, of course, I did not look for, 
but some degree of security from positive failure was indispensable—I 
must not take my son to starve. And then I must have money for the 
journey, the passage, and some little to support us in our retreat in 
case I should be unsuccessful at first; and not too little either, for 
who could tell how long I might have to struggle with the indifference 
or neglect of others, or my own inexperience, or inability to suit 
their tastes? 
</p>
               <p>What should I do then? Apply to my brother, and explain my 
circumstances and my resolves to him? No, no; even if I told him 
<hi>all</hi> my grievances, which I should be very reluctant to do, he 
would be certain to disapprove of the step: it would seem like madness 
to him, as it would to my uncle and aunt, or to Milicent. No; I must 
have patience and gather a hoard of my own. Rachel should be my only 
confidant—I thought I could persuade her into the scheme; and she 
should help me, first to find out a picture dealer in some distant 
town; then, through her means, I would privately sell what pictures I 
had on hand that would do for such a purpose, and some of those I 
should thereafter paint. Besides this, I would contrive to dispose of 
my jewels—not the family jewels, but the few I brought with me from 
home, and those my uncle gave me on my marriage. A few months' arduous 
toil might well be borne by me, with such an end in view; and in the 
interim, my son could not be much more injured than he was already. 
</p>
               <p>Having formed this resolution, I immediately set to work to accomplish 
it. I might possibly have been induced to wax cool 
upon it afterwards, or perhaps, to keep weighing the pros and cons in 
my mind till the latter overbalanced the former, and I was driven to 
relinquish the project altogether, or delay the execution of it to an 
indefinite period,—had not something occurred to confirm me in that 
determination to which I still adhere, which I still think I did well 
to form, and shall do better to execute. 
</p>
               <p>Since Lord Lowborough's departure, I had regarded the library as 
entirely my own, a secure retreat at all hours of the day. None of our 
gentlemen had the smallest pretensions to a literary taste, except Mr. 
Hargrave; and he, at present, was quite contented with the newspapers 
and periodicals of the day. And if, by any chance, he should look in 
here, I felt assured he would soon depart on seeing me, for instead of 
becoming less cool and distant towards me, he had become decidedly more 
so since the departure of his mother and sisters, which was just what 
I wished. Here, then, I set up my easel, and here I worked at my 
canvass from daylight till dusk, with very little intermission saving 
when pure necessity, or my duties to little Arthur called me away—for 
I still thought proper to devote some portion of every day exclusively 
to his instruction and amusement. But contrary to my expectation, on 
the third morning, while I was thus employed, Mr. Hargrave <hi>did</hi>
look in, and did <hi>not</hi> immediately withdraw on seeing me. He 
apologized for his instrusion, and said he was only come for a book; 
but when he had got it, he condescended to cast a glance over my 
picture. Being a man of taste, he had something to say on this subject 
as well as another, and having modestly commented on it, without much 
encouragement from me, he proceeded to expatiate on the art in general. 
Receiving no encouragement in that either, he dropped it, but did not 
depart. 
</p>
               <p>`You don't give us much of your company, Mrs. Huntingdon,' observed he, 
after a brief pause, during which I went on coolly mixing and tempering 
my colours; `and I cannot wonder at it, for you must be heartily sick 
of us all. I myself am so thoroughly ashamed of my companions, and so 
weary of their irrational conversation and pursuits—now that there is 
no one to humanize them and keep them in check, since you have justly 
abandoned us to our own devices—that I think I 
shall presently withdraw from amongst them—probably within this 
weekend I cannot suppose you will regret my departure. 
</p>
               <p>He paused. I did not answer. 
</p>
               <p>`Probably,' he added, with a smile, `your only regret on the subject 
will be, that I do not take all my companions along with me. I flatter 
myself, at times, that though among them, I am not of them; but it is 
natural that you should be glad to get rid of me. I may regret this, 
but I cannot blame you for it.' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall not rejoice at <hi>your</hi> departure, for you <hi>can</hi>
conduct yourself like a gentleman,' said I, thinking it but right to 
make some acknowledgment for his good behaviour, `but I must confess 
I shall rejoice to bid adieu to the rest, inhospitable as it may 
appear. 
</p>
               <p>`No one can blame you for such an avowal,' replied he gravely; `not 
even the gentlemen themselves, I imagine. I'll just tell you,' he 
continued, as if actuated by a sudden resolution, `what was said last 
night in the dining-room, after you left us—perhaps you will not mind 
it as you're so <hi>very</hi> philosophical on certain points,' he added 
with a slight sneer. `They were talking about Lord Lowborough and his 
delectable lady, the cause of whose sudden departure is no secret 
amongst them; and her character is so well known to them all, that, 
nearly related to me as she is, I could not attempt to defend it.—God 
curse me,' he muttered, <hi>par parenthèse,</hi> `if I don't have 
vengeance for this! If the villain <hi>must</hi> disgrace the family, 
must he blazon it abroad to every low-bred knave of his 
acquaintance?—I beg your pardon, Mrs. Huntingdon. Well, they were 
talking of these things, and some of them remarked that, as she was 
separated from her husband, he might see her again when he pleased.' 
</p>
               <p>`”Thank you,” said he; “I've had enough of her for the present: I'll 
not trouble to see her, unless she comes to me.” 
</p>
               <p>`”Then what do you mean to do, Huntingdon, when we're gone?” said Ralph 
Hattersley. “Do you mean to turn from the error of your ways, and be 
a good husband, a good father, and so forth—as I do, when I get shut 
of you and all these rollicking devils you call your friends? I think 
it's time; and your wife is fifty times too good for you, you 
<hi>know</hi>—” 
</p>
               <p>`And he added some praise of you, which you would not thank me for 
repeating—or him for uttering; proclaiming it aloud, as he did, 
without delicacy or discrimination, in an audience where it seemed 
profanation to utter your name—himself utterly incapable of 
understanding or appreciating your real excellencies. Huntingdon 
meanwhile, sat quietly drinking his wine, or looking smilingly into his 
glass and offering no interruption or reply, till Hattersley shouted 
out,— 
</p>
               <p>`”Do you hear me, man?” 
</p>
               <p>`”Yes, go on,” said he. 
</p>
               <p>`”Nay, I've done,” replied the other: “I only want to know if you 
intend to take my advice.” 
</p>
               <p>`”What advice?” 
</p>
               <p>`”To turn over a new leaf, you double-dyed scoundrel,” shouted Ralph, 
“and beg your wife's pardon, and be a good boy for the future.” 
</p>
               <p>`”My wife! what wife? I have no wife,” replied Huntingdon, looking 
innocently up from his glass—“or if I have, look you gentlemen, I 
value her so highly that any one among you, that can fancy her, may 
have her and welcome—you may, by Jove and my blessing into the 
bargain!” 
</p>
               <p>`I—hem—some one asked if he really meant what he said, upon which, 
he solemnly swore he did, and no mistake.—What do you think of that, 
Mrs. Huntingdon?' asked Mr. Hargrave, after a short pause, during which 
I had felt he was keenly examining my half-averted face. 
</p>
               <p>`I say,' replied I, calmly, `that what he prizes so lightly, will not 
be long in his possession.' 
</p>
               <p>`You cannot mean that you will break your heart and die for the 
detestable conduct of an infamous villain like that!' 
</p>
               <p>`By no means: my heart is too thoroughly dried to be broken in a hurry, 
and I mean to live as long as I can.' 
</p>
               <p>`Will you leave him then?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes.' 
</p>
               <p>`When—and how?' asked he, eagerly. 
</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>`When</hi> I am ready, and <hi>how</hi> I can manage it most 
effectually.' 
</p>
               <p>`But your child?' 
</p>
               <p>`My child goes with me.' 
</p>
               <p>`He will not allow it.' 
</p>
               <p>`I shall not ask him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah, then, it is a secret flight you meditate!—but with whom, Mrs. 
Huntingdon?' 
</p>
               <p>`With my son—and, possibly, his nurse.' 
</p>
               <p>`Alone—and unprotected! But where can you go? What can you do? He will 
follow you and bring you back.' 
</p>
               <p>`I have laid my plans too well for that. Let me once get clear of 
Grassdale, and I shall consider myself safe.' 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Hargrave advanced one step towards me, looked me in the face, and 
drew in his breath to speak; but that look, that heightened colour, 
that sudden sparkle of the eye made my blood rise in wrath: I abruptly 
turned away, and, snatching up my brush, began to dash away at my 
canvass with rather too much energy for the good of the picture. 
</p>
               <p>`Mrs. Huntingdon,' said he with bitter solemnity, `you are cruel—cruel 
to me—cruel to yourself.' 
</p>
               <p>`Mr. Hargrave, remember your promise.' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>must</hi> speak—my heart will burst if I don't! I have been 
silent long enough—and you <hi>must</hi> hear me!' cried he boldly 
intercepting my retreat to the door. `You tell me you owe no allegiance 
to your husband; he openly declares himself weary of you, and calmly 
gives you up to any body that will take you; you are about to leave 
him; no one will believe that you go alone—all the world will say, 
“She has left him at last, and who can wonder at it? Few can blame her, 
fewer still can pity him; but who is the companion of her flight?” Thus 
you will have no credit for your virtue (if you call it such): even 
your best friends will not believe in it; because, it is monstrous, and 
not to be credited—but by those who suffer from the effects of it, 
such cruel torments that they know it to be indeed reality.—But what 
can you do in the cold, rough world alone? you, a young and 
inexperienced woman, delicately nurtured, and utterly—' 
</p>
               <p>`In a word, you would advise me to stay where I am,' interrupted I. 
`Well, I'll see about it.' 
</p>
               <p>`By <hi>all means,</hi> leave him!' cried he earnestly, `but NOT alone! 
Helen! let <hi>me</hi> protect you!' 
</p>
               <p>`Never!—while Heaven spares my reason,' replied I, snatching away the 
hand he had presumed to seize and press between his own. But he was in 
for it now; he had fairly broken the barrier: he was completely roused, 
and determined to hazard all for victory. 
</p>
               <p>`I must not be denied!' exclaimed he vehemently; and seizing both my 
hands, he held them very tight, but dropped upon his knee, and looked 
up in my face with a half-imploring, half-imperious gaze. `You have no 
reason now: you are flying in the face of Heaven's decrees. God has 
designed me to be your comfort and Protector—I feel it—I know it as 
certainly as if a voice from Heaven declared “Ye twain shall be one 
flesh”—and you spurn me from you— 
</p>
               <p>`Let me go, Mr. Hargrave!' said I sternly. But he only tightened his 
grasp. 
</p>
               <p>`Let me go!' I repeated, quivering with indignation. 
</p>
               <p>His face was almost opposite the window as he knelt. With a slight 
start, I saw him glance towards it; and then a gleam of malicious 
triumph lit up his countenance. Looking over my shoulder, I beheld a 
shadow just retiring round the corner. 
</p>
               <p>`That is Grimsby,' said he deliberately. `He will report what he has 
seen to Huntingdon and all the rest, with such embellishments as he 
thinks proper. He has no love for you, Mrs. Huntingdon—no reverence 
for your sex—no belief in virtue—no admiration for its image. He will 
give such a version of this story as will leave no doubt at all, about 
your character, in the minds of those who hear it. Your fair fame is 
gone; and nothing that I or you can say can ever retrieve it. But give 
me the power to protect you, and show me the villain that dares to 
insult!' 
</p>
               <p>`No one has ever dared to insult me as you are doing now!' said I, at 
length releasing my hands, and recoiling from him. 
</p>
               <p>`I do not insult you,' cried he: `I worship you. You are my angel—my 
divinity! I lay my powers at your feet—and you must and shall accept 
them!' he exclaimed impetuously, starting to his feet—I <hi>mill</hi>
be your consoler and defender! and if your conscience upbraid you for 
it, say I overcame you and you could not choose but yield!' 
</p>
               <p>I never saw a man so terribly excited. He precipitated himself towards 
me. I snatched up my palette-knife and held it 
against him. This startled him: he stood and gazed at me in 
astonishment; I dare say I looked as fierce and resolute as he. I moved 
to the bell and put my hand upon the cord. This tamed him still more. 
With a half-authoritative, half-deprecating wave of the hand, he sought 
to deter me from ringing. 
</p>
               <p>`Stand off, then!' said I. He stepped back.— `And listen to me.—I 
don't like you,' I continued, as deliberately and emphatically as I 
could, to give the greater efficacy to my words; `and if I were 
divorced from my husband—or if he were dead, I would not marry you. 
There now! I hope you're satisfied.' 
</p>
               <p>His face grew blanched with anger. 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>am</hi> satisfied,' he replied with bitter emphasis, `that you are 
the most cold-hearted, unnatural, ungrateful woman I ever yet 
beheld!' 
</p>
               <p>`Ungrateful sir?' 
</p>
               <p>`Ungrateful.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Mr. Hargrave; I am not. For all the good you ever did me, or ever 
wished to do, I most sincerely thank you: for all the evil you have 
done me, and all you would have done, I pray God to pardon you, and 
make you of a better mind.' 
</p>
               <p>Here the door was thrown open, and Messrs. Huntingdon and Hattersley 
appeared without. The latter remained in the hall, busy with his 
ram-rod and his gun; the former walked in, and stood with his back to 
the fire, surveying Mr. Hargrave and me, particularly the former, with 
a smile of insupportable meaning, accompanied as it was, by the 
impudence of his brazen brow and the sly, malicious twinkle of his 
eye. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, sir?' said Hargrave interrogatively, and with the air of one 
prepared to stand on the defensive. 
</p>
               <p>`Well, sir,' returned his host. 
</p>
               <p>`We want to know if you're at liberty to join us in a go at the 
pheasants, Walter,' interposed Hattersley from without. `Come! there 
shall be nothing shot besides, except a puss' or two; <hi>I'll </hi>
vouch for that.' 
</p>
               <p>Walter did not answer, but walked to the window to collect his 
faculties, Arthur uttered a low whistle, and followed him with his 
eyes. A slight flush of anger rose to Hargrave's cheek; but in a 
moment, he turned calmly round, and said carelessly— 
</p>
               <p>`I came here to bid farewell to Mrs. Huntingdon, and tell her I must 
go to-morrow. 
</p>
               <p>`Humph! You're mighty sudden in your resolution. What takes you off so 
soon, may I ask?' 
</p>
               <p>`Business,' returned he, repelling the other's incredulous sneer with 
a glance of scornful defiance. 
</p>
               <p>`Very good,' was the reply; and Hargrave walked away. Thereupon, Mr. 
Huntingdon, gathering his coat laps under his arms, and setting his 
shoulder against the mantle-piece, turned to me, and, addressing me in 
a low voice, scarcely above his breath, poured forth a volley of the 
vilest and grossest abuse it was possible for the imagination to 
conceive or the tongue to utter. I did not attempt to interrupt him; 
but my spirit kindled within me, and when he had done, I replied— 
</p>
               <p>`If your accusation were true, Mr. Huntingdon, how <hi>dare you </hi>
blame me?' 
</p>
               <p>`She's hit it, by Jove!' cried Hattersley, rearing his gun against the 
wall; and, stepping into the room, he took his precious friend by the 
arm, and attempted to drag him away. `Come, my lad,' he muttered; `true 
or false, <hi>you've</hi> no right to blame her, you <hi>know</hi>—nor him 
either; after what you said last night. So come along.' 
</p>
               <p>There was something implied here that I could not endure. 
</p>
               <p>`Dare you suspect me, Mr. Hattersley?' said I, almost beside myself 
with fury. 
</p>
               <p>`Nay, nay, I suspect nobody. It's all right—it's all right. So come 
along Huntingdon, you blackguard.' 
</p>
               <p>`She can't deny it!' cried the gentleman thus addressed, grinning in 
mingled rage and triumph. `She can't deny it if her life depended on 
it!' and muttering some more abusive language, he walked into the hall, 
and took up his hat and gun from the table. 
</p>
               <p>`I scorn to justify myself to you!' said I. `But you,' turning to 
Hattersley, `if you presume to have any doubts on the subject, ask Mr. 
Hargrave.' 
</p>
               <p>At this, they simultaneously burst into a rude laugh that made my whole 
frame tingle to the finger's ends. 
</p>
               <p>`Where is he? I'll ask him myself!' said I, advancing towards them. 
</p>
               <p>Suppressing a new burst of merriment, Hattersley pointed to the outer 
door. It was half open. His brother-in-law was standing on the front 
without. 
</p>
               <p>`Mr. Hargrave, will you please to step this way?' said I. He turned and 
looked at me in grave surprise. `Step this way, if you please!' I 
repeated, in so determined a manner that he could not, or did not 
choose to resist its authority. Somewhat reluctantly he ascended the 
steps and advanced a pace or two into the hall. 
</p>
               <p>`And tell those gentlemen,' I continued— `these <hi>men</hi> whether or 
not I yielded to your solicitations.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't understand you, Mrs. Huntingdon.' 
</p>
               <p>`You <hi>do</hi> understand me, sir; and I charge you upon your honour 
as a gentleman (if you have any), to answer truly. Did I, or did I 
not?' 
</p>
               <p>`No,' muttered he, turning away. 
</p>
               <p>`Speak up sir; they can't hear you. Did I grant your request?' 
</p>
               <p>`You did not.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I'll be sworn she didn't,' said Hattersley, `or he'd never look 
so black.' 
</p>
               <p>`I'm willing to grant you the satisfaction of a gentleman, Huntingdon,' 
said Mr. Hargrave, calmly addressing his host, but with a bitter sneer 
upon his countenance. 
</p>
               <p>`Go to the deuce!' replied the latter, with an impatient jerk of the 
head. Hargrave withdrew with a look of cold disdain, saying,— 
</p>
               <p>`You know where to find me, should you feel disposed to send a 
friend.' 
</p>
               <p>Muttered oaths and curses were all the answer this intimation 
obtained. 
</p>
               <p>`Now Huntingdon, you see!' said Hattersley, `clear as the day.' 
</p>
               <p>`I don't care <hi>what</hi> he sees,' said I, `or what he imagines; but 
you, Mr. Hattersley, when you hear my name belied and slandered, will 
you defend it?' 
</p>
               <p>`I will. Blast me if I don't!' 
</p>
               <p>I instantly departed, and shut myself into the library. What could 
possess me to make such a request of such a man? I 
cannot tell, but drowning men catch at straws: they had driven me 
desperate between them; I hardly knew what I said. There was no other 
to preserve my name from being blackened and aspersed among this nest 
of boon companions, and through them, perhaps into the world; and 
beside my abandoned wretch of a husband, the base, malignant Grimsby, 
and the false villain Hargrave, this boarish ruffian, coarse and brutal 
as he was, shone like a glow-worm in the dark, among its fellow 
worms. 
</p>
               <p>What a scene was this! Could I ever have imagined that I should be 
doomed to bear such insults under my own roof—to hear such things 
spoken in my presence—nay spoken <hi>to</hi> me and <hi>of</hi> me—and 
by those who arrogated to themselves the name of gentlemen? And could 
I have imagined that I should have been able to endure it as calmly, 
and to repel their insults as firmly and as boldly as I had done? A 
hardness such as this, is taught by rough experience and despair 
alone. 
</p>
               <p>Such thoughts as these, chased one another through my mind, as I paced 
to and fro the room, and longed—oh, <hi>how</hi> I longed to take my 
child and leave them now, without an hour's delay! But it could not be: 
there was work before me—hard work, that must be done. 
</p>
               <p>`Then let me do it,' said I, `and lose not a moment in vain repinings, 
and idle chafings against my fate, and those who influence it.' 
</p>
               <p>And conquering my agitation with a powerful effort, I immediately 
resumed my task, and laboured hard all day. 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Hargrave did depart on the morrow; and I have never seen him since. 
The others stayed on for two or three weeks longer; but I kept aloof 
from them as much as possible, and still continued my labour, and have 
continued it, with almost unabated ardour, to the present day. I soon 
acquainted Rachel with my design, confiding all my motives and 
intentions to her ear, and much to my agreeable surprise, found little 
difficulty in persuading her to enter into my views. She is a sober, 
cautious woman, but she so hates her master, and so loves her mistress 
and her nursling, that after several ejaculations, a few faint 
objections, and many tears and lamentations that I should be brought 
to such a pass, she applauded my resolution and consented to aid me 
with all her might—on one condition, 
</p>
               <p>only—that she might share my exile: otherwise, she was utterly 
inexorable, regarding it as perfect madness for me and Arthur to go 
alone. With touching generosity, she modestly offered to aid me with 
her little hoard of savings, hoping I would `excuse her for the 
liberty, but really if I would do her the favour to accept it as a 
loan, she should be very happy.' Of course I could not think of such 
a thing;—but now, thank Heaven, I have gathered a little hoard of my 
own, and my preparations are so far advanced, that I am looking forward 
to a speedy emancipation. Only let the stormy severity of this winter 
weather be somewhat abated, and then, some morning Mr. Huntingdon will 
come down to a solitary breakfast-table, and perhaps be clamouring 
through the house for his invisible wife and child, when they are some 
fifty miles on their way to the western world—or it may be more, for 
we shall leave him hours before the dawn, and it is not probable he 
will discover the loss of both, until the day is far advanced. 
</p>
               <p>I am fully alive to the evils that may, and must result upon the step 
I am about to take; but I never waver in my resolution, because I never 
forget my son. It was only this morning—while I pursued my usual 
employment, he was sitting at my feet, quietly playing with the shreds 
of canvass I had thrown upon the carpet—but his mind was otherwise 
occupied, for, in a while, he looked up wistfully in my face, and 
gravely asked— 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma, why are you wicked?' 
</p>
               <p>`Who told you I was wicked, love?' 
</p>
               <p>`Rachel.' 
</p>
               <p>`No Arthur, Rachel never said so, I am certain.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well then, it was papa,' replied he thoughtfully. Then, after a 
reflective pause, he added, `At least, I'll tell you how it was I got 
to know: when I'm with papa, if I say mamma wants me, or mamma says I'm 
not to do something that he tells me to do—he always says, “Mamma be 
damned,'—and Rachel says it's only wicked people that are damned. So 
mamma, that's why I think you must be wicked—and I wish you 
wouldn't.' 
</p>
               <p>`My dear child, I am not. Those are bad words, and wicked people often 
say them of others better than themselves. Those words cannot make 
people be damned, nor show that they deserve it. God will judge us by 
our own thoughts and deeds, 
not by what others say about us. And when you hear such words spoken, 
Arthur, remember never to repeat them: it is wicked to say such things 
of others, not to have them said against you. 
</p>
               <p>`Then it's papa that's wicked,' said he, ruefully. 
</p>
               <p>`Papa is wrong to say such things, and you will be very wrong to 
imitate him, now that you know better.' 
</p>
               <p>`What <hi>is</hi> imitate?' 
</p>
               <p>`To do as he does.' 
</p>
               <p>`Does <hi>he</hi> know better?' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps he does; but that is nothing to you.' 
</p>
               <p>`If he doesn't, you ought to tell him, mamma.' 
</p>
               <p>`I <hi>have</hi> told him.' 
</p>
               <p>The litHe moralist paused and pondered. I tried in vain to divert his 
mind from the subject. 
</p>
               <p>`I'm sorry papa's wicked,' said he mournfully, at length, `for I don't 
want him to go to hell.' And so saying he burst into tears. 
</p>
               <p>I consoled him with the hope that perhaps his papa would alter and 
become good before he died—but is it not time to deliver him from such 
a parent? 
</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL</head>
               <head>A MISADVENTURE</head>
               <p>Jan. 10th, 1827. While writing the above, yesterday evening, I sat in 
the drawing-room. Mr. Huntingdon was present, but, as I thought, asleep 
on the sofa behind me. He had risen however, unknown to me, and, 
actuated by some base spirit of curiosity, been looking over my 
shoulder for I know not how long; for when I had laid aside my pen, and 
was about to close the book, he suddenly placed his hand upon it, and 
saying—With your leave, my dear, I'll have a look at this,' forcibly 
wrested it from me, and, drawing a chair to the table, composedly sat 
down to examine it—turning back leaf after leaf to find an explanation 
of what he had read. Unluckily for me, he was more sober that night 
than he usually is at such an hour. 
</p>
               <p>Of course I did not leave him to pursue this occupation in quiet: I 
made several attempts to snatch the book from his hands, but he held 
it too firmly for that; I upbraided him in bitterness and scorn for his 
mean and dishonourable conduct, but that had no effect upon him; and, 
finally, I extinguished both the candles, but he only wheeled round to 
the fire, and raising a blaze sufficient for his purposes, calmly 
continued the investigation. I had serious thoughts of getting a 
pitcher of water and extinguishing that light too; but it was evident 
his curiosity was too keenly excited to be quenched by that, and the 
more I manifested my anxiety to baffle his scrutiny, the greater would 
be his determination to persist in it—besides it was too late. 
</p>
               <p>`It seems very interesting, love,' said he, lifting his head and 
turning to where I stood wringing my hands in silent rage and anguish; 
`but it's rather long; I'll look at it some other time;—and meanwhile, 
I'll trouble you for your keys, my dear.' 
</p>
               <p>`What keys?' 
</p>
               <p>`The keys of your cabinet, desk, drawers, and whatever else you 
possess,' said he, rising and holding out his hand. 
</p>
               <p>`I've not got them,' I replied. The key of my desk, in fact, was, at 
that moment, in the lock, and the others were attached to it. 
</p>
               <p>`Then you must send for them,' said he; `and if that old bitch, Rachel, 
doesn't immediately deliver them up, she tramps bag and baggage 
to-morrow.' 
</p>
               <p>`She doesn't know where they are,' I answered, quietly placing my hand 
upon them, and taking them from the desk, as I thought, unobserved. 
<hi>`I</hi> know, but I shall not give them up without a reason.' 
</p>
               <p>`And <hi>I</hi> know, too,' said he, suddenly seizing my closed hand and 
rudely abstracting them from it. He then took up one of the candles and 
relighted it by thrusting it into the fire. 
</p>
               <p>`Now then,' sneered he, `we must have a confiscation of property. But 
first, let us take a peep into the studio.' 
</p>
               <p>And putting the keys into his pocket, he walked into the library. I 
followed, whether with the dim idea of preventing mischief or only to 
know the worst I can hardly tell. My painting materials were laid 
together on the corner table, ready for to-morrow's use, and only 
covered with a cloth. He soon spied them out, and putting down the 
candle, deliberately proceeded to cast them into the fire—palette, 
paints, bladders, pencils, brushes, varnish—I saw them all 
consumed—the palette knives snapped in two—the oil and turpentine 
sent hissing and roaring up the chimney. He then rang the bell. 
</p>
               <p>`Benson, take those things away,' said he, pointing to the easel, 
canvass, and stretcher;' `and tell the housemaid she may kindle the 
fire with them: your mistress won't want them any more.' 
</p>
               <p>Benson paused aghast and looked at me. 
</p>
               <p>`Take them away, Benson,' said I; and his master muttered an oath. 
</p>
               <p>`And this and all, sir?' said the astonished servant referring to the 
half-finished picture. 
</p>
               <p>`That and all,' replied the master; and the things were cleared 
away. 
</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntingdon then went up stairs. I did not attempt to follow him, 
but remained seated in the arm-chair, speechless, tearless, and almost 
motionless, till he returned about half an hour after, and walking up 
to me, held the candle in my face and peered into my eyes with looks 
and laughter too insulting to be borne. With a sudden stroke of my 
hand, I dashed the candle to the floor. 
</p>
               <p>`Hal-lo!' muttered he, starting back.— `She's the very devil for 
spite! Did <hi>ever</hi> any mortal see such eyes?—They shine in the 
dark like a cat's. <hi>Oh,</hi> you're a sweet one!' So saying, he 
gathered up the candle and the candlestick. The former being broken as 
well as extinguished, he rang for another. 
</p>
               <p>`Benson, your mistress has broken the candle: bring another.' 
</p>
               <p>`You expose yourself finely,' observed I as the man departed. 
</p>
               <p>`I didn't say <hi>I'd</hi> broken it, did I?' returned he. He then threw 
my keys into my lap, saying,— `There! you'll find nothing gone but 
your money, and the jewels—and a few little trifles I thought it 
advisable to take into my own possession, lest your mercantile spirit 
should be tempted to turn them into gold. I've left you a few 
sovereigns in your purse, which I expect to last you through the 
month—at all events, when you want more you will be so good as to give 
me an account of how that's spent. I shall put you upon a small monthly 
allowance, in future, for your own private expenses; and you needn't 
trouble yourself any more about my concerns; I shall look out for a 
steward, my dear; I won't expose you to the temptation. And as for the 
household matters, Mrs. Greaves must be very particular in keeping her 
accounts: we must go upon an entirely new plan— 
</p>
               <p>`What great discovery have you made <hi>now,</hi> Mr. Huntingdon? Have 
I attempted to defraud you?' 
</p>
               <p>`Not in money matters, exactly, it seems, but it's best to keep out of 
the way of temptation.' 
</p>
               <p>Here Benson entered with the candles, and there followed a brief 
interval of silence—I sitting still in my chair, and he standing with 
his back to the fire, silently triumphing in my despair. 
</p>
               <p>`And so,' said he at length, `you thought to disgrace me, did you, by 
running away and turning artist, and supporting yourself by the labour 
of your hands, forsooth? And you thought to rob me of my son too, and 
bring him up to be a dirty Yankee tradesman, or a low, beggarly 
painter?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, to obviate his becoming such a gentleman as his father.' 
</p>
               <p>`It's well you couldn't keep your own secret—ha, ha! It's well these 
women must be blabbing—if they haven't a friend to talk to, they must 
whisper their secrets to the fishes, or write them on the sand or 
something; and it's well too I wasn't over full to-night, now I think 
of it, or I might have snoosed away and never dreamt of looking what 
my sweet lady was about—or I might have lacked the sense or the power 
to carry my point like a man, as I have done.' 
</p>
               <p>Leaving him to his self-congratulations, I rose to secure my 
manuscript, for I now remembered it had been left upon the drawing-room 
table, and I determined, if possible, to save myself the humiliation 
of seeing it in his hands again. I could not bear the idea of his 
amusing himself over my secret thoughts and recollections; though, to 
be sure, he would find little good of himself therein indited, except 
in the former part—and oh, I would sooner burn it all than he should 
read what I had written when I was such a fool as to love him! 
</p>
               <p>`And by the by,' cried he as I was leaving the room, `you'd better tell 
that d—d old sneak of a nurse to keep out of my way for a day or 
two—I'd pay her her wages and send her packing to-morrow, but I know 
she'd do more mischief out of the house than in it.' 
</p>
               <p>And as I departed, he went on cursing and abusing my faithful friend 
and servant with epithets I will not defile this paper with repeating. 
I went to her as soon as I had put away my book, and told her how our 
project was defeated. She was as much distressed and horrified as I 
was—and more so than I was that night, for I was partly stunned by the 
blow, and partly excited and supported against it by the bitterness of 
my wrath. But in the morning, when I woke without that cheering hope 
that had been my secret comfort and support so long, and all this day, 
when I have wandered about restless and objectless, shunning my 
husband, shrinking even from my child—knowing that I am unfit to be 
his teacher or companion, hoping nothing for his future life, and 
fervently wishing he had never been born—I felt the full extent of my 
calamity—and I feel it now. I know that day after day such feelings 
will return upon me: I am a slave, a prisoner—but that is nothing; if 
it were myself alone, I would not complain, but I am forbidden to 
rescue my son from ruin, and what was once my only consolation, is 
become the crowning source of my despair. 
</p>
               <p>Have I no faith in God? I try to look to Him and raise my heart to 
Heaven, but it will cleave to the dust:' I can only say—`He hath 
hedged me about, that I cannot get out: He hath made my chain heavy. 
He hath filled me with bitterness, He hath made me drunken with 
wormwood:'—I forget to add—`But though He cause grief, yet will He 
have compassion according to the multitude of His mercies. For He doth 
not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.” I ought to think 
of this; and if there be nothing but sorrow for me in this world, what 
is the longest life of misery to a whole eternity of peace? And for my 
little Arthur—has he no friend but me? Who was it said, `It is not the 
will of your Father which is in Heaven that one of these little ones 
should perish?”

               <head>CHAPTER XLI</head>
               <head>HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL IN THE HUMAN BREAST</head>
               <p>March 20th.—Having now got rid of Mr. Huntingdon for a season, my 
spirits begin to revive. He left me early in February; and the moment 
he was gone, I breathed again, and felt my vital energy return; not 
with the hope of escape—he has taken care to leave me no visible 
chance of that—but with a determination to make the best of existing 
circumstances. Here was Arthur left to me at last; and rousing from my 
despondent apathy, I exerted all my powers to eradicate the weeds that 
had been fostered in his infant mind, and sow again the good seed they 
had rendered unproductive. Thank Heaven, it is not a barren or a stony 
soil; if weeds spring fast there, so do better plants. His 
apprehensions are more quick, his heart more overflowing with affection 
than ever his father's could have been; and it is no hopeless task to 
bend him to obedience and win him to love and know his own true friend, 
as long as there is no one to counteract my efforts. 
</p>
               <p>I had much trouble at first in breaking him of those evil habits his 
father had taught him to acquire, but already that difficulty is nearly 
vanquished now: bad language seldom defiles his mouth, and I have 
succeeded in giving him an absolute disgust for all intoxicating 
liquors, which I hope not even his father or his father's friends will 
be able to overcome. He was inordinately fond of them for so young a 
creature, and, remembering my unfortunate father as well as his, I 
dreaded the consequences of such a taste. But if I had stinted him in 
his usual quantity of wine or forbidden him to taste it altogether, 
that would only have increased his partiality for it, and made him 
regard it as a greater treat than ever. I therefore gave him quite as 
much as his father was accustomed to allow him—as much indeed, as he 
desired to have, but into every glass I surreptitiously introduced a 
small quantity of tartar-emetic—just enough to produce inevitable 
nausea and depression without positive sickness. Finding such 
disagreeable consequences invariably to result from this indulgence, 
he soon grew weary of it, but the more he shrank from the daily treat 
the more I pressed it upon him, till his reluctance was strengthened 
to perfect abhorrence. When he was thoroughly disgusted with every kind 
of wine, I allowed him, at his own request, to try brandy and water and 
then gin and water; for the little toper was familiar with them all, 
and I was determined that all should be equally hateful to him. This 
I have now effected; and since he declares that the taste, the smell, 
the sight of any one of them is sufficient to make him sick, I have 
given up teazing him about them, except now and then as objects of 
terror in cases of misbehaviour: `Arthur, if you're not a good boy I 
shall give you a glass of wine,' or `Now Arthur, if you say that again 
you shall have some brandy and water,' is as good as any other threat; 
and, once or twice, when he was sick, I have obliged the poor child to 
swallow a little wine and water <hi>without</hi> the tartar-emetic, by 
way of medicine; and this practice I intend to continue for some time 
to come; not that I think it of any real service in a physical sense, 
but because I am determined to enlist all the powers of association in 
my service: I wish this aversion to be so deeply grounded in his nature 
that nothing in after life may be able to overcome it. 
</p>
               <p>Thus, I flatter myself, I shall secure him from this one vice; and for 
the rest, if on his father's return I find reason to apprehend that my 
good lessons will be all destroyed—if Mr. Huntingdon commence again 
the game of teaching the child to hate and despise his mother and 
emulate his father's wickedness, I will yet deliver my son from his 
hands. I have devised another scheme that might be resorted to in such 
a case, and if I could but obtain my brother's consent and assistance, 
I should not doubt of its success. The old Hall where he and I were 
born and where our mother died, is not now inhabited, nor yet quite 
sunk into decay, as I believe. Now if I could persuade him to have one 
or two rooms made habitable and to let them to me as a stranger, I 
might live there, with my child, under an assumed name, and still 
support myself by my favourite art. He should lend me the money to 
begin with, and I would pay him back, and live in lowly independence 
and strict seclusion, for the house stands in a lonely place, and the 
neighbourhood is thinly inhabited, and he himself should negotiate the 
sale of my pictures for me. I have arranged the whole plan in my head; 
and all I want, is to persuade Frederick to be of the same mind as 
myself. He is coming to see me soon, and then I will make the proposal 
to him, having first enlightened him upon my circumstances sufficiently 
to excuse the project. 
</p>
               <p>Already, I believe, he knows much more of my situation than I have told 
him. I can tell this by the air of tender sadness pervading his 
letters; and by the fact of his so seldom mentioning my husband, and 
generally evincing a kind of covert bitterness when he does refer to 
him; as well as by the circumstances of his never coming to see me when 
Mr. Huntingdon is at home. But he has never openly expressed any 
disapprobation of him or sympathy for me; he has never asked any 
questions, or said anything to invite my confidence. Had he done so, 
I should probably have had but few concealments from him. Perhaps, he 
feels hurt at my reserve. He is a strange being—I wish we knew each 
other better. He used to spend a month at Staningley every year, before 
I was married; but, since our father's death, I have only seen him 
once, when he came for a few days while Mr. Huntingdon was away. He 
shall stay many days this time, and there shall be more candour and 
cordiality between us than ever there was before, since our early 
childhood: my heart clings to him more than ever; and my soul is sick 
of solitude. 
</p>
               <p>April 16th.—He is come and gone. He would not stay above a fortnight. 
The time passed quickly, but very, very happily, and it has done me 
good. I must have a bad disposition, for my misfortunes have soured and 
embittered me exceedingly: I was beginning insensibly to cherish very 
unamiable feelings against my fellow mortals—the male part of them 
especially; but it is a comfort to see there is at least one among them 
worthy to be trusted and esteemed; and doubtless there are more, though 
I have never known them—unless I except poor Lord Lowborough, and he 
was bad enough in his day; but what would Frederick have been, if he 
had lived in the world, and mingled from his childhood with such men 
as these of my acquaintance? and what <hi>will</hi> Arthur be, with all 
his natural sweetness of disposition, if I do not save him from that 
world and those companions? I mentioned my fears to Frederick and 
introduced the subject of my plan of rescue on the evening after his 
arrival, when I presented my little son to his uncle. 
</p>
               <p>`He is like you, Frederick,' said I, `in some of his moods: I sometimes 
think he resembles you more than his father; and I am glad of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`You flatter me, Helen,' replied he, stroking the child's soft, wavy 
locks. 
</p>
               <p>`No,—you will think it no compliment when I tell you I would rather 
have him to resemble <hi>Benson</hi> than his father.' 
</p>
               <p>He slightly elevated his eyebrows, but said nothing. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you know what sort of man Mr. Huntingdon is?' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`I think I have an idea.' 
</p>
               <p>`Have you so clear an idea that you can hear, without surprise or 
disapproval, that I meditate escaping with that child to some secret 
asylum where we can live in peace and never see him again?' 
</p>
               <p>`Is it really so?' 
</p>
               <p>`If you have not,' continued I, `I'll tell you something more about 
him' and I gave a sketch of his general conduct, and a more particular 
account of his behaviour with regard to his child, and explained my 
apprehensions on the latter's account, and my determination to deliver 
him from his father's influence. 
</p>
               <p>Frederick was exceedingly indignant against Mr. Huntingdon, and very 
much grieved for me; but still, he looked upon my project as wild and 
impracticable; he deemed my fears for Arthur disproportioned to the 
circumstances, and opposed so many objections to my plan, and devised 
so many milder methods for ameliorating my condition, that I was 
obliged to enter into further details to convince him that my husband 
was utterly incorrigible, and that nothing could persuade him to give 
up his son whatever became of me, he being as fully determined the 
child should not leave him, as I was not to leave the child; and that, 
in fact, nothing would answer but this, unless I fled the country as 
I had intended before. To obviate that, he at length consented to have 
one wing of the old Hall put into a habitable condition, as a place of 
refuge against a time of need; but hoped I would not take advantage of 
it, unless circumstances should render it really necessary, which I was 
ready enough to promise; for, though, for my own sake, such a hermitage 
appears like paradise itself compared with my present situation, yet 
for my friends' sakes—for Milicent and Esther, my sisters in heart and 
affection, for the poor tenants of Grassdale, and above all for my 
aunt—I will stay if I possibly can. 
</p>
               <p>July 29th.—Mrs. Hargrave and her daughter are come back from London. 
Esther is full of her first season in town; but she is still 
heart-whole and unengaged. Her mother sought out an excellent match for 
her, and even brought the gentleman to lay his heart and fortune at her 
feet; but Esther had the audacity to refuse the noble gifts. He was a 
man of good family and large possessions, but the naughty girl 
maintained he was old as Adam, ugly as sin, and hateful as one who 
shall be nameless. 
</p>
               <p>`But indeed, I had a hard time of it,' said she: `mamma was very 
greatly disappointed at the failure of her darling project, and very, 
very angry at my obstinate resistance to her will,—and is so still; 
but I can't help it. And Walter, too, is so seriously displeased at my 
perversity and absurd caprice, as he calls it, that I fear he will 
never forgive me—I did not think he <hi>could</hi> be so unkind as he 
has lately shown himself. But Milicent begged me not to yield, and I'm 
sure, Mrs. Huntingdon, if you had seen the man they wanted to palm upon 
me, you would have advised me not to take him too.' 
</p>
               <p>`I should have done so whether I had seen him or not,' said I. `It is 
enough that you dislike him.' 
</p>
               <p>`I knew you would say so; though mamma affirmed you would be quite 
shocked at my undutiful conduct—you can't imagine how she lectures 
me—I am disobedient and ungrateful; I am thwarting her wishes, 
wronging my brother, and making myself a burden on her hands—I 
sometimes fear she'll overcome me after all. I have a strong will, but 
so has she, and when she says such bitter things, it provokes me to 
such a pass that I feel inclined to do as she bids me, and then break 
my heart and say “There, mamma, it's all your fault!”' 
</p>
               <p>`Pray don't!' said I. `Obedience from such a motive would be positive 
wickedness, and certain to bring the punishment it deserved. Stand 
firm, and your mamma will soon relinquish her persecution;—and the 
gentleman himself will cease to pester you with his addresses if he 
finds them steadily rejected.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no! mamma will weary all about her before she tires herself with 
her exertions; and as for Mr. Oldfield, she has given him to understand 
that I have refused his offer, not from any dislike of his person, but 
merely because I am giddy and young, and cannot at present reconcile 
myself to the thoughts of marriage under any circumstances: but, by 
next season, she has no doubt, I shall have more sense, and hopes my 
girlish fancies will be worn away. So she has brought me home, to 
school me into a proper sense of my duty, against the time comes round 
again—indeed, I believe she will not put herself to the expense of 
taking me up to London again, unless I surrender: she cannot afford to 
take me to town for pleasure and nonsense, she says, and it is not 
<hi>every</hi> rich gentleman that will consent to take me without a 
fortune, whatever exalted ideas I may have of my own attractions.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well Esther, I pity you; but still, I repeat, stand firm. You might 
as well sell yourself to slavery at once, as marry a man you dislike. 
If your mother and brother are unkind to you, you may leave them, but 
remember you are bound to your husband for life.'s 
</p>
               <p>`But I cannot leave them unless I get married, and I cannot get married 
if nobody sees me. I saw one or two gentlemen in London, that I might 
have liked, but they were younger sons, and mamma would not let me get 
to know them—one especially, who I believe rather liked me, but she 
threw every possible obstacle in the way of our better 
acquaintance—wasn't it provoking?' 
</p>
               <p>`I have no doubt you would feel it so, but it is possible that if you 
married him, you might have more reason to regret it hereafter, than 
if you married Mr. Oldfield. When I tell you not to marry 
<hi>without</hi> love, I do not advise you to marry for love alone—there 
are many, many other things to be considered. Keep both heart and hand 
in your own possession, till you see good reason to part with them; and 
if such an occasion should never present itself, comfort your mind with 
this reflection: that, though in single life your joys may not be very 
many, your sorrows at least will not be more than you can bear. 
Marriage may change your circumstances for the better, but in my 
private opinion, it is far more likely to produce a contrary 
result.' 
</p>
               <p>`So thinks Milicent, but allow me to say, <hi>I</hi> think otherwise. If 
I thought myself doomed to old-maidenhood, I should cease to value my 
life. The thought of living on, year after year at the Grove—a 
hanger—on upon mamma and Walters mere cumberer of the ground (now that 
I know in what light they would regard it), is perfectly intolerable—I 
would rather run away with the butler.' 
</p>
               <p>`Your circumstances are peculiar I allow; but have patience, love; do 
nothing rashly. Remember you are not yet nineteen, and many years are 
yet to pass before any one can set you down as an old maid: you cannot 
tell what Providence may have in store for you. And meantime, remember 
you have a <hi>tight</hi> to the protection and support of your mother 
and brother, however they may seem to grudge it.' 
</p>
               <p>`You are so grave, Mrs. Huntingdon,' said Esther after a pause. `When 
Milicent uttered the same discouraging sentiments concerning marriage, 
I asked if she was happy: she said she was; but I only half believed 
her; and now I must put the same question to you.' 
</p>
               <p>`It is a very impertinent question,' laughed I, `from a young girl to 
a married woman so many years her senior—and I shall not answer 
it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Pardon me, dear <hi>madam,'</hi> said she, laughingly throwing herself 
into my arms, and kissing me with playful affection; but I felt a tear 
on my neck, as she dropped her head on my bosom and continued, with an 
odd mixture of sadness and levity, timidity and audacity,—`I know you 
are not so happy as I mean to be, for you spend half your life alone 
at Grassdale, while Mr. Huntingdon goes about enjoying himself where, 
and how he pleases.—I shall expect <hi>my</hi> husband to have no 
pleasures but what he shares with me; and if his greatest pleasure of 
all is not the enjoyment of my company—why—it will be the worse for 
him—that's all.' 
</p>
               <p>`If such are your expectations of matrimony, Esther, you must indeed, 
be careful whom you marry—or rather, you must avoid it altogether.' 
</p>

            <div xml:id="c3.42" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLII</head>
               <head>A REFORMATION</head>
               <p>Sept. 1st.—No Mr. Huntingdon yet. Perhaps he will stay among his 
friends till Christmas; and then, next spring, he will be off again. 
If he continue this plan, I shall be able to stay at Grassdale well 
enough—that is, I shall be able to stay, and that is enough; even an 
occasional bevy of friends at the shooting season, may be borne if 
Arthur get so firmly attached to me—so well established in good sense 
and principles, before they come, that I shall be able, by reason and 
affection, to keep him pure from their contaminations. Vain hope, I 
fear! but still, till such a time of trial comes, I will forbear to 
think of my quiet asylum in the beloved old Hall. 
</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Hattersley have been staying at the Grove a fortnight; and 
as Mr. Hargrave is still absent, and the weather was remarkably fine, 
I never passed a day without seeing my two friends, Milicent and 
Esther, either there or here. On one occasion, when Mr. Hattersley had 
driven them over to Grassdale in the phaeton, with little Helen and 
Ralph, and we were all enjoying ourselves in the garden—I had a few 
minutes' conversation with that gentleman, while the ladies were 
amusing themselves with the children. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you want to hear anything of your husband, Mrs. Huntingdon?' said 
he. 
</p>
               <p>`No, unless you can tell me when to expect him home.' 
</p>
               <p>`I can't.—You don't want him, do you?' said he with a broad grin. 
</p>
               <p>`No.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I think you're better without him, sure enough—for my part, I'm 
downright weary of him. I told him I'd leave him if he didn't mend his 
manners—and he wouldn't; so I left him—you see I'm a better man than 
you think me;—and what's more, I have serious thoughts of washing my 
hands of him entirely, and the whole set of `em, and comporting myself 
from this day forward, with all decency and sobriety as a Christian and 
the father of a family should do.—What do you think of that?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is a resolution you ought to have formed long ago. `Well, I'm 
not thirty yet: it isn't too late, is it?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; it is never too late to reform, as long as you have the sense to 
desire it, and the strength to execute your purpose.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, to tell you the truth, I've thought of it often and often 
before, but he's such devilish good company is Huntingdon, after 
all—you can't imagine what a jovial good-fellow he is when he's not 
fairly drunk, only just primed or half-seas-over—we all have a bit of 
a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts, though we can't respect 
him.' 
</p>
               <p>`But should you wish yourself to be like him?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, I'd rather be like myself, bad as I am.' 
</p>
               <p>`You can't continue as bad as you are without getting worse—and more 
brutalized every day—and therefore more like him.' 
</p>
               <p>I could not help smiling at the' comical, half angry, half confounded 
look he put on at this rather unusual mode of address. 
</p>
               <p>`Never mind my plain speaking,' said I; `it is from the best of 
motives. But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like Mr. 
Huntingdon—or even like yourself?' 
</p>
               <p>`Hang it, no.' 
</p>
               <p>`Should you wish your daughter to despise you—or, at least, to feel 
no vestige of respect for you, and no affection but what is mingled 
with the bitterest regret?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, blast it, no! I couldn't stand that.' 
</p>
               <p>`And finally, should you wish your wife to be ready to sink into the 
earth when she hears you mentioned; and to loathe the very sound of 
your voice, and shudder at your approach?' 
</p>
               <p>`She never will; she likes me all the same, whatever I do.' 
</p>
               <p>`Impossible, Mr. Hattersley! you mistake her quiet submission for 
affection.' 
</p>
               <p>`Fire and fury—' 
</p>
               <p>`Now don't burst into a tempest at that—I don't mean to say she does 
not love you—he does, I know, a great deal better than you 
deserve—but I am quite sure, that if you behave better, she will love 
you more, and if you behave worse, she will love you less and less till 
all is lost in fear, aversion, and bitterness of soul, if not in secret 
hatred and contempt. But, dropping the subject of affection, should you 
wish to be the tyrant of her life—to take away all the sunshine from 
her existence, and make her thoroughly miserable?' 
</p>
               <p>`Of course not; and I don't, and I'm not going to.' 
</p>
               <p>`You have done more towards it than you suppose.' 
</p>
               <p>`Pooh, pooh! she's not the susceptible, anxious, worriting creature you 
imagine: she's a little meek, peaceable, affectionate body; apt to be 
rather sulky at times, but quiet and cool in the main, and ready to 
take things as they come.' 
</p>
               <p>`Think of what she was five years ago, when you married her, and what 
she is now.' 
</p>
               <p>`I know—he was a little plump lassie then, with a pretty pink and 
white face: now, she's a poor little bit of a creature, fading and 
melting away like a snow-wreath'—but hang it!—By Jupiter, that's not 
my fault!' 
</p>
               <p>`What is the cause of it then? Not years, for she's only five and 
twenty. 
</p>
               <p>`It's her own delicate health, and—confound it, madam! what would you 
make of me?—and the children, to be sure, that worry her to death 
between them.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Mr. Hattersley, the children give her more pleasure than pain: 
they are fine well dispositioned children—' 
</p>
               <p>`I know they artless `em!' 
</p>
               <p>`Then why lay the blame on them?—I'll tell you what it is: it's silent 
fretting and constant anxiety on your account, mingled I suspect, with 
something of bodily fear on her own. When you behave well, she can only 
rejoice with trembling; she has no security, no confidence in your 
judgment or principles; but is continually dreading the close of such 
short-lived felicity: when you behave ill, her causes of terror and 
misery are more than any one can tell but herself. In patient endurance 
of evil, she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their 
transgressions.—Since you will mistake her silence for indifference, 
come with me, and I'll show you one or two of her letters—no breach 
of confidence, I hope, since you are her other half.' 
</p>
               <p>He followed me into the library. I sought out and put into his hands 
two of Milicent's letters; one dated from London and written during one 
of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation; the other in the 
country during a lucid interval. The former was full of trouble and 
anguish; not accusing him, but deeply regretting his connection with 
his profligate companions, abusing Mr. Grimsby and others, insinuating 
bitter things against Mr. Huntingdon, and most ingeniously throwing the 
blame of her husband's misconduct on to other men's shoulders. The 
latter was full of hope and joy, yet with a trembling consciousness 
that this happiness would not last; praising his goodness to the skies, 
but with an evident, though but half expressed wish that it were based 
on a surer foundation than the natural impulses of the heart, and a 
half prophetic dread of the fall of that house so founded on the 
sand,—which fall had shortly after taken place, as Hattersley must 
have been conscious while he read. 
</p>
               <p>Almost at the commencement of the first letter, I had the unexpected 
pleasure of seeing him blush; but he immediately turned his back to me 
and finished the perusal at the window. At the second, I saw him, once 
or twice, raise his hand and hurriedly pass it across his face. Could 
it be to dash away a tear? When he had done, there was an interval 
spent in clearing his throat and staring out of the window, and then, 
after whistling a few bars of a favourite air, he turned round, gave 
me back the letters and silently shook me by the hand. 
</p>
               <p>`I've been a cursed rascal, God knows,' said he as he gave it a hearty 
squeeze, `but you see if I don't make amends for it—G—d d—n me if 
I don't!' 
</p>
               <p>`Don't curse yourself, Mr. Hattersley; if God had heard half your 
invocations of that kind, you would have been in hell long before 
now—and you cannot make amends for the past by doing your duty for the 
future, in as much as your duty is only what you owe to your Maker, and 
you cannot do more than fulfil it—another must make amends for your 
past delinquencies. If you intend to reform, invoke God's blessing, His 
mercy, and His aid; not His curse. 
</p>
               <p>`God help me, then—for I'm sure I need it.—Where's Milicent?' 
</p>
               <p>`She's there, just coming in with her sister.' 
</p>
               <p>He stepped out at the glass door, and went to meet them. I followed at 
a little distance. Somewhat to his wife's astonishment, he lifted her 
off from the ground and saluted her with a hearty kiss and a strong 
embrace; then, placing his two hands on her shoulders, he gave her, I 
suppose, a sketch of the great things he meant to do, for she suddenly 
threw her arms round him and burst into tears, exclaiming,— 
</p>
               <p>`Do, do, Ralph—we shall be so happy! How very, very good you are!' 
</p>
               <p>`Nay, not I,' said he, turning her round and pushing her towards me. 
`Thank her, it's her doing.' 
</p>
               <p>Milicent flew to thank me, overflowing with gratitude. I disclaimed all 
title to it, telling her her husband was predisposed to amendment 
before I added my mite of exhortation and encouragement, and that I had 
only done what she might—and ought to—have done herself. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, no!' cried she, `I couldn't have influenced him, I'm sure, by 
anything that I could have said. I should only have bothered him by my 
clumsy efforts at persuasion, if I had made the attempt. 
</p>
               <p>`You never tried me, Milly,' said he. 
</p>
               <p>Shortly after, they took their leave. They are now gone on a visit to 
Hattersley's father. After that, they will repair to their country 
home. I hope his good resolutions will not fall through, and poor 
Milicent will not be again disappointed. Her last letter was full of 
present bliss and pleasing anticipations for the future; but no 
particular temptation has yet occurred to put his virtue to the test. 
Henceforth, however, she will doubtless be somewhat less timid and 
reserved, and he more kind and thoughtful.—Surely, then, her hopes are 
not unfounded; and I have one bright spot, at least, whereon to rest 
my thoughts.

            <div xml:id="c3.43" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLIII</head>
               <head>THE BOUNDARY PAST</head>
               <p>October 10th.—Mr. Huntingdon returned about three weeks ago. His 
appearance, his demeanour and conversation, and my feelings with regard 
to him, I shall not trouble myself to describe. The day after his 
arrival, however, he surprised me by the announcement of an intention 
to procure a governess for little Arthur: I told him it was quite 
unnecessary, not to say ridiculous, at the present season: I thought 
I was fully competent to the task of teaching him myself—for some 
years to come, at least: the child's education was the only pleasure 
and business of my life; and since he had deprived me of every other 
occupation, he might surely leave me that. 
</p>
               <p>He said I was not fit to teach children, or to be with them: I had 
already reduced the boy to little better than an automaton, I had 
broken his fine spirit with my rigid severity; and I should freeze all 
the sunshine out of his heart, and make him as gloomy an ascetic as 
myself, if I had the handling of him much longer. And poor Rachel, too, 
came in for her share of abuse, as usual; he cannot endure Rachel, 
because he knows she has a proper appreciation of him. 
</p>
               <p>I calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess, 
and still resisted the proposed addition to our family; but he cut me 
short by saying, it was no use bothering about the matter, for he had 
engaged a governess already, and she was coming next week; so that all 
I had to do was to get things ready for her reception. This was a 
rather startling piece of intelligence. I ventured to inquire her name 
and address, by whom she had been recommended, or how he had been led 
to make choice of her. 
</p>
               <p>`She is a very estimable, pious young person,' said he; `you needn't 
be afraid. Her name is Myers, I believe; and she was recommended to me 
by a respectable old dowager-lady of high repute in the religious 
world. I have not seen her myself, and therefore cannot give you a 
particular account of her person and conversation, and so forth; but, 
if the old lady's eulogies are correct, you will find her to possess 
all desirable qualifications for her position—an inordinate love of 
children among the rest.' 
</p>
               <p>All this was gravely and quietly spoken, but there was a laughing demon 
in his half-averted eye that boded no good I imagined. However, I 
thought of my asylum in —hire, and made no further objections. 
</p>
               <p>When Miss Myers arrived, I was not prepared to give her a very cordial 
reception. Her appearance was not particularly calculated to produce 
a favourable impression at first sight, nor did her manners and 
subsequent conduct, in any degree, remove the prejudice I had already 
conceived against her. Her attainments were limited, her intellect 
noways above mediocrity. She had a fine voice, and could sing like a 
nightingale, and accompany herself sufficiently well on the piano; but 
these were her only accomplishments. There was a look of guile and 
subtlety in her face, a sound of it in her voice. She seemed afraid of 
me, and would start if I suddenly approached her. In her behaviour, she 
was respectful and complaisant even to servility: she attempted to 
flatter and fawn upon me at first, but I soon checked that. Her 
fondness for her little pupil was overstrained, and I was obliged to 
remonstrate with her on the subject of over-indulgence and injudicious 
praise; but she could not gain his heart. Her piety consisted in an 
occasional heaving of sighs and uplifting of eyes to the ceiling, and 
the utterance of a few cant phrases. She told me she was a clergyman's 
daughter, and had been left an orphan from her childhood, but had had 
the good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious family; and then 
she spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced from its 
different members that I reproached myself for my uncharitable thoughts 
and unfriendly conduct, and relented for a time—but not for long; my 
causes of dislike were too rational, my suspicions too well founded for 
that; and I knew it was my duty to watch and scrutinize till those 
suspicions were either satisfactorily removed or confirmed. 
</p>
               <p>I asked the name and residence of the kind and pious family. She 
mentioned a common name, and an unknown and distant place of abode, but 
told me they were now on the Continent, and their present address was 
unknown to her. I never saw her speak much to Mr. Huntingdon; but he 
would frequently look into the school-room to see how little Arthur got 
on with his new companion, when I was not there. In the evening, she 
sat with us in the drawing-room, and would sing and play to amuse 
him—or us, as she pretended—and was very attentive to his wants, and 
watchful to anticipate them, though she only talked to me—indeed, he 
was seldom in a condition to be talked to. Had she been other than she 
was, I should have felt her presence a great relief to come between us 
thus, except, indeed, that I should have been thoroughly ashamed for 
any decent person to see him as he often was. 
</p>
               <p>I did not mention my suspicions to Rachel; but she, having sojourned 
for half a century in this land of sin and sorrow, has learned to be 
suspicious herself. She told me from the first she was `down of' that 
new governess,' and I soon found she watched her quite as narrowly as 
I did; and I was glad of it, for I longed to know the truth: the 
atmosphere of Grassdale seemed to stifle me, and I could only live by 
thinking of Wildfell Hall. 
</p>
               <p>At last, one morning, she entered my chamber with such intelligence 
that my resolution was taken before she had ceased to speak. While she 
dressed me, I explained to her my intentions and what assistance I 
should require from her, and told her which of my things she was to 
pack up, and what she was to leave behind for herself, as I had no 
other means of recompencing her for this sudden dismissal, after her 
long and faithful service—a circumstance I most deeply regretted but 
could not avoid. 
</p>
               <p>`And what will you do, Rachel?' said I—`will you go home, or seek 
another place?' 
</p>
               <p>`I have no home, ma'am, but with you,' she replied; `and if I leave 
you, I'll never go into place again as long as I live.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I can't afford to live like a lady, now,' returned I: `I must be 
my own maid and my child's nurse. 
</p>
               <p>`What signifies?' replied she in some excitement. `You'll want somebody 
to clean and wash, and cook, won't you? I can do all that; and never 
mind the wages—I've my bits o' savings yet, and if you wouldn't take 
me, I should have to find my own board and lodging out of `em 
somewhere, or else work among strangers—and it's what I'm not used too 
you can please yourself ma'am.' Her voice quavered as she spoke, and 
the tears stood in her eyes. 
</p>
               <p>`I should like it above all things, Rachel, and I'd give you such wages 
as I could afford—such as I should give to any servant of all work I 
might employ; but don't you see I should be dragging you down with me, 
when you have done nothing to deserve it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, fiddle!' ejaculated she. 
</p>
               <p>`And besides, my future way of living will be so widely different to 
the past—so different to all you have been accustomed to—' 
</p>
               <p>`Do you think, ma'am, I can't bear what my missis can?—surely I'm not 
so proud and so dainty as that comes tend my little master too, God 
bless him?' 
</p>
               <p>`But I'm young, Rachel; I shan't mind it; and Arthur is young too—it 
will be nothing to him.' 
</p>
               <p>`Nor me either: I'm not so old but what I can stand hard fare and hard 
work, if it's only to help and comfort them as I've loved like my own 
barns—for all I'm too old to bide the thoughts o' leaving `em in 
trouble and danger, and going amongst strangers myself.' 
</p>
               <p>`Then you shan't, Rachel!' cried I, embracing my faithful friend. 
`We'll all go together, and you shall see how the new life suits 
you. 
</p>
               <p>`Bless you, honey!' cried she affectionately returning my embrace. 
`Only let us get shut of this wicked house and we'll do right enough, 
you'll see.' 
</p>
               <p>`So think I,' was my answer;—and so that point was settled. 
</p>
               <p>By that morning's post, I despatched a few hasty lines to Frederick, 
beseeching him to prepare my asylum for my immediate reception—for I 
should probably come to claim it within a day after the receipt of that 
note,—and telling him in few words, the cause of my sudden resolution. 
I then wrote three letters of adieu: the first to Esther Hargrave, in 
which I told her that I found it impossible to stay any longer at 
Grassdale, or to leave my son under his father's protection; and, as 
it was of the last importance that our future abode should be unknown 
to him and his acquaintance, I should disclose it to no one but my 
brother, through the medium of whom I hoped still to correspond with 
my friends. I then gave her his address, exhorted her to write 
frequently, reiterated some of my former admonitions regarding her own 
concerns, and hade her a fond farewell. 
</p>
               <p>The second was to Milicent; much to the same effect, but a little more 
confidential, as befitted our longer intimacy, and her greater 
experience and better acquaintance with my circumstances. 
</p>
               <p>The third was to my aunts much more difficult and painful undertaking, 
and therefore I had left it to the last; but I must give her some 
explanation of that extraordinary step I had taken,—and that quickly, 
for she and my uncle would no doubt hear of it within a day or two 
after my disappearance, as it was probable that Mr. Huntingdon would 
speedily apply to them to know what was become of me. At last however, 
I told her I was sensible of my error: I did not complain of its 
punishment, and I was sorry to trouble my friends with its 
consequences; but in duty to my son, I must submit no longer; it was 
absolutely necessary that he should be delivered from his father's 
corrupting influence. I should not disclose my place of refuge even to 
her, in order that she and my uncle might be able, with truth, to deny 
all knowledge concerning it; but any communications addressed to me 
under cover to my brother, would be certain to reach me. I hoped she 
and my uncle would pardon the step I had taken, for if they knew all, 
I was sure they would not blame me; and I trusted they would not 
afflict themselves on my account, for if I could only reach my retreat 
in safety and keep it unmolested, I should be very happy, but for the 
thoughts of them; and should be quite contented to spend my life in 
obscurity, devoting myself to the training up of my child, and teaching 
him to avoid the errors of both his parents. 
</p>
               <p>These things were done yesterday: I have given two whole days to the 
preparation for our departure, that Frederick may have more time to 
prepare the rooms, and Rachel to pack up the things—for the latter 
task must be done with the utmost caution and secresy, and there is no 
one but me to assist her: I can help to get the articles together, but 
I do not understand the art of stowing them into the boxes, so as to 
take up the smallest possible space; and there are her own things to 
do, as well as mine and Arthur's. I can ill afford to leave anything 
behind, since I have no money, except a few guineas in my purse;—and 
besides, as Rachel observed, whatever I left would most likely become 
the property of Miss Myers, and I should not relish that. 
</p>
               <p>But what trouble I have had throughout these two days struggling to 
appear calm and collected—to meet him and her as usual, when I was 
obliged to meet them, and forcing myself to leave my little Arthur in 
her hands for hours together! But I trust these trials are over now: 
I have laid him in my bed for better security, and never more, I trust, 
shall his innocent lips be defiled by their contaminating kisses, or 
his young ears polluted by their words. But shall we escape in safety? 
Oh, that the morning were come, and we were on our way at least! This 
evening, when I had given Rachel all the assistance I could, and had 
nothing left me but to wait, and wish and tremble, I became so greatly 
agitated, that I knew not what to do. I went down to dinner, but I 
could not force myself to eat. Mr. Huntingdon remarked the 
circumstance. 
</p>
               <p>`What's to do with you now?' said he, when the removal of the second 
course gave him time to look about him. 
</p>
               <p>`I am not well,' I replied: `I think I must lie down a little you won't 
miss me much?' 
</p>
               <p>`Not the least; if you leave your chair, it'll do just as well—better 
a trifle,' he muttered as I left the room, `for I can fancy somebody 
else fills it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Somebody else may fill it to-morrow,' I thought—but did not say. 
`There! I've seen the last of you, I hope,' I muttered as I closed the 
door upon him. 
</p>
               <p>Rachel urged me to seek repose, at once, to recruit my strength for 
to-morrow's journey, as we must be gone before the dawn, but in my 
present state of nervous excitement, that was entirely out of the 
question. It was equally out of the question to sit, or wander about 
my room, counting the hours and the minutes between me and the 
appointed time of action, straining my ears and trembling at every 
sound lest some one should discover and betray us after all. I took up 
a book and tried to read. My eyes wandered over the pages, but it was 
impossible to bind my thoughts to their contents. Why not have recourse 
to the old expedient, and add this last event to my chronicle? I opened 
its pages once more, and wrote the above account—with difficulty, at 
first, but gradually my mind became more calm and steady. Thus several 
hours have past away: the time is drawing near;—and now my eyes feel 
heavy, and my frame exhausted: I will commend my cause to God, and then 
lie down and gain an hour or two of sleep; and then!— 
</p>
               <p>Little Arthur sleeps soundly. All the house is still: there can be no 
one watching. The boxes were all corded by Benson, and quietly conveyed 
down the back stairs after dusk, and sent away in a cart to the M— 
coach-office. The name upon the cards was Mrs. Graham, which 
appellation I mean henceforth to adopt. My mother's maiden name was 
Graham, and therefore I fancy I have some claim to it, and prefer it 
to any other, except my own, which I dare not resume.

               <head>THE RETREAT</head>
               <p>October 24th.—Thank Heaven, I am free and safe at last!—Early we 
rose, swiftly and quietly dressed, slowly and stealthily descended to 
the hall, where Benson stood ready with a light to open the door and 
fasten it after us. We were obliged to let one man into our secret on 
account of the boxes, &amp;c. All the servants were but too well acquainted 
with their master's conduct, and either Benson or John would have been 
willing to serve me, but as the former was more staid and elderly, and 
a crony of Rachel's besides, I of course directed her to make choice 
of him as her assistant and confidant on the occasion, as far as 
necessity demanded. I only hope he may not be brought into trouble 
thereby, and only wish I could reward him for the perilous service he 
was so ready to undertake. I slipped two guineas into his hand, by way 
of remembrance, as he stood in the door-way, holding the candle to 
light our departure, with a tear in his honest grey eye and a host of 
good wishes depicted on his solemn countenance. Alas! I could offer no 
more: I had barely sufficient remaining for the probable expenses of 
the journey. 
</p>
               <p>What trembling joy it was when the little wicket closed behind us, as 
we issued from the park! Then, for one moment, I paused, to inhale one 
draught of that cool, bracing air, and venture one look back upon the 
house. All was dark and still; no light glimmered in the windows; no 
wreath of smoke obscured the stars that sparkled above it in the frosty 
sky. As I bade farewell for ever to that place, the scene of so much 
guilt and misery, I felt glad that I had not left it before, for now 
there was no doubt about the propriety of such a step—no shadow of 
remorse for him I left behind: there was nothing to disturb my joy but 
the fear of detection; and every step removed us farther from the 
chance of that. 
</p>
               <p>We had left Grassdale many miles behind us before the round, red sun 
arose to welcome our deliverance, and if any inhabitant of its vicinity 
had chanced to see us then, as we bowled along on the top of the coach, 
I scarcely think they would have suspected our identity. As I intend 
to be taken for a widow I thought it advisable to enter my new abode 
in mourning: I was therefore attired in a plain black silk dress and 
mantle, a black veil (which I kept carefully over my face for the first 
twenty or thirty miles of the journey), and a black silk bonnet, which 
I had been constrained to borrow of Rachel for want of such an article 
myself—it was not in the newest fashion, of course; but none the worse 
for that, under present circumstances. Arthur was clad in his plainest 
clothes, and wrapped in a coarse woollen shawl; and Rachel was muffled 
in a grey cloak and hood that had seen better days, and gave her more 
the appearance of an ordinary, though decent old woman, than of a 
lady's maid. 
</p>
               <p>Oh, what delight it was to be thus seated aloft, rumbling along the 
broad, sunshiny road, with the fresh morning breeze in my face, 
surrounded by an unknown country all smiling—cheerfully, gloriously, 
smiling in the yellow lustre of those early beams,—with my darling 
child in my arms, almost as happy as myself and my faithful friend 
beside me; a prison and despair behind me, receding farther, farther 
back at every clatter of the horses' feet,—and liberty and hope 
before! I could hardly refrain from praising God aloud for my 
deliverance, or astonishing my fellow passengers by some surprising 
out-burst of hilarity. 
</p>
               <p>But the journey was a very long one, and we were all weary enough 
before the close of it. It was far into the night when we reached the 
town of L , and still we were seven miles from our journey's end; and 
there was no more coaching—or any conveyance to be had, except a 
common cart—and that with the greatest difficulty, for half the town 
was in bed. And a dreary ride we had of it that last stage of the 
journey, cold and weary as we were; sitting on our boxes, with nothing 
to cling to, nothing to lean against, slowly dragged and cruelly shaken 
over the rough, hilly roads. But Arthur was asleep in Rachel's lap, and 
between us we managed pretty well to shield him from the cold night 
air. 
</p>
               <p>At last we began to ascend a terribly steep and stony lane which, in 
spite of the darkness, Rachel said she remembered well: she had often 
walked there with me in her arms, and little thought to come again so 
many years after, under such circumstances as the present. Arthur being 
now awakened by the jolting and the stoppages, we all got out and 
walked. We had not far to go; but what if Frederick should not have 
received my letter? or if he should not have had time to prepare the 
rooms for our reception; and we should find them all dark, damp, and 
comfortless; destitute of food, fire, and furniture, after all our 
toil? 
</p>
               <p>At length the grim, dark pile appeared before us. The lane conducted 
us round by the back way. We entered the desolate court, and in 
breathless anxiety surveyed the ruinous mass. Was it all blackness and 
desolation? No; one faint red glimmer cheered us from a window where 
the lattice was in good repair. The door was fastened, but after due 
knocking and waiting, and some parleying with a voice from an upper 
window, we were admitted, by an old woman who had been commissioned to 
air and keep the house till our arrival,—into a tolerably snug little 
apartment, formerly the scullery of the mansion, which Frederick had 
now fitted up as a kitchen. Here she procured us a light, roused the 
fire to a cheerful blaze, and soon prepared a simple repast for our 
refreshment; while we disencumbered ourselves of our travelling gear, 
and took a hasty survey of our new abode. Besides the kitchen there 
were two bedrooms, a good sized parlour, and another smaller one, which 
I destined for my studio, all well aired and seemingly in good repair, 
but only partly furnished with a few old articles, chiefly of ponderous 
black oak—the veritable ones that had been there before, and which had 
been kept as antiquarian relics in my brother's present residence, and 
now in all haste, transported back again. 
</p>
               <p>The old woman brought my supper and Arthur's into the parlour, and told 
me, with all due formality, that `The master desired his compliments 
to Mrs. Graham, and he had prepared the rooms as well as he could upon 
so short a notice, but he would do himself the pleasure of calling upon 
her to-morrow, to receive her further commands.' 
</p>
               <p>I was glad to ascend the stern-looking stone staircase, and lie down 
in the gloomy old-fashioned bed, beside my little Arthur. He was asleep 
in a minute; but, weary as I was, my excited feelings and restless 
cogitations kept me awake till dawn began to struggle with the 
darkness; but sleep was sweet and refreshing when it came, and the 
waking was delightful beyond expression. It was little Arthur that 
roused me, with his gentle kisses:—he was here, then—safely clasped 
in my arms, and many leagues away from his unworthy father!—Broad 
daylight illumined the apartment, for the sun was high in heaven, 
though obscured by rolling masses of autumnal vapour. 
</p>
               <p>The scene, indeed, was not remarkably cheerful in itself, either within 
or without. The large bare room with its grim old furniture, the 
narrow, latticed windows, revealing the dull, grey sky above and the 
desolate wilderness below, where the dark stone walls and iron gate, 
the rank growth of grass and weeds, and the hardy ever-greens of 
preternatural forms, alone remained to tell that there had been once 
a garden,—and the bleak and barren fields beyond might have struck me 
as gloomy enough at another time, but now, each separate object seemed 
to echo back my own exhilarating sense of hope and freedom: indefinite 
dreams of the far past and bright anticipations of the future seemed 
to greet me at every turn. I should rejoice with more security, to be 
sure, had the broad sea rolled between my present and my former homes, 
but surely in this lonely spot I might remain unknown; and then, I had 
my brother here to cheer my solitude with his occasional visits. 
</p>
               <p>He came that morning; and I have had several interviews with him since; 
but he is obliged to be very cautious when and how he comes: not even 
his servants, or his best friends must know of his visits to 
Wildfell—except on such occasions as a landlord might be expected to 
call upon a stranger tenant—lest suspicion should be excited against 
me, whether of the truth or of some slanderous falsehood. 
</p>
               <p>I have now been here nearly a fortnight, and but for one disturbing 
care, the haunting dread of discovery, I am comfortably settled in my 
new home: Frederick has supplied me with all requisite furniture and 
painting materials: Rachel has sold most of my clothes for me, in a 
distant town, and procured me a wardrobe more suitable to my present 
position: I have a second hand piano, and a tolerably well-stocked 
bookcase in my parlour; and my other room has assumed quite a 
professional, business-like appearance already. I am working hard to 
repay my brother for all his expenses on my account; not that there is 
the slightest necessity for anything of the kind, but it pleases me to 
do so: I shall have so much more pleasure in my labour, my earnings, 
my frugal fare, and household economy, when I know that I am paying my 
way honestly, and that what little I possess is legitimately all my 
own; and that no one suffers for my folly—in a pecuniary way at 
least.—I shall make him take the last penny I owe him, if I can 
possibly effect it without offending him too deeply. I have a few 
pictures already done, for I told Rachel to pack up all I had; and she 
executed her commission but too well, for among the rest, she put up 
a portrait of Mr. Huntingdon that I had painted in the first year of 
my marriage. It struck me with dismay, at the moment, when I took it 
from the box and beheld those eyes fixed upon me in their mocking 
mirth, as if exulting, still, in his power to control my fate, and 
deriding my efforts to escape. 
</p>
               <p>How widely different had been my feelings in painting that portrait to 
what they now were in looking upon it! How I had studied and toiled to 
produce something, as I thought, worthy of the original! what mingled 
pleasure and dissatisfaction I had had in the result of my 
labours!—pleasure for the likeness I had caught; dissatisfaction, 
because I had not made it handsome enough. Now, I see no beauty in 
it—nothing pleasing in any part of its expression; and yet it is far 
handsomer and far more agreeable—far less repulsive I should rather 
say—than he is now; for these six years have wrought almost as great 
a change upon himself as on my feelings regarding him. The frame, 
however, is handsome enough; it will serve for another painting. The 
picture itself I have not destroyed, as I had first intended; I have 
put it aside; not, I think, from any lurking tenderness for the memory 
of past affection, nor yet to remind me of my former folly, but chiefly 
that I may compare my son's features and countenance with this, as he 
grows up, and thus be enabled to judge how much or how little he 
resembles his father—if I may be allowed to keep him with me still, 
and never to behold that father's face again—blessing I hardly dare 
reckon upon. 
</p>
               <p>It seems Mr. Huntingdon is making every exertion to discover the place 
of my retreat. He has been in person to Staningley, seeking redress for 
his grievances—expecting to hear of his victims, if not to find them 
there—and has told so many lies, and with such unblushing coolness, 
that my uncle more than half believes him, and strongly advocates my 
going back to him and being friends again; but my aunt knows better: 
she is too cool and cautious, and too well acquainted with both my 
husband's character and my own to be imposed upon by any specious 
falsehoods the former could invent. But he does not <hi>want</hi> me 
back; he wants my child; and gives my friends to understand that if I 
prefer living apart from him, he will indulge the whim and let me do 
so unmolested, and even settle a reasonable allowance on me, provided 
I will immediately deliver up his son. But, Heaven help me! I am not 
going to sell my child for gold, though it were to save both him and 
me from starving: it would be better that he should die with me, than 
that he should live with his father. 
</p>
               <p>Frederick showed me a letter he had received from that gentleman, full 
of cool impudence such as would astonish any one who did not know him, 
but such as, I am convinced, none would know better how to answer than 
my brother. He gave me no account of his reply, except to tell me that 
he had not acknowledged his acquaintance with my place of refuge, but 
rather left it to be inferred that it was quite unknown to him, by 
saying it was useless to apply to him or any other of my relations for 
information on the subject, as it appeared I had been driven to such 
extremity that I had concealed my retreat even from my best friends; 
but that if he <hi>had</hi> known it, or should at any time be made aware 
of it, most certainly Mr. Huntingdon would be the last person to whom 
he should communicate the intelligence; and' that he need not trouble 
himself to bargain for the child, for he (Frederick) fancied he knew 
enough of his sister to enable him to declare, that wherever she might 
be, or however situated, no consideration would induce her to deliver 
him up. 
</p>
               <p>30th.—Alas! my kind neighbours will not let me alone. By some means 
they have ferreted me out, and I have had to sustain visits from three 
different families, all more or less bent upon discovering who and what 
I am; whence I came, and why I have chosen such a home as this. Their 
society is unnecessary to me, to say the least, and their curiosity 
annoys and alarms me: if I gratify it, it may lead to the ruin of my 
son, and if I am too mysterious, it will only excite their suspicions, 
invite conjecture, and rouse them to greater exertions—and perhaps be 
the means of spreading my fame from parish to parish, till it reach the 
ears of some one who will carry it to the lord of Grassdale Manor. 
</p>
               <p>I shall be expected to return their calls, but if, upon enquiry, I find 
that any of them live too far away for Arthur to accompany me, they 
must expect in vain for a while, for I cannot bear to leave him, unless 
it be to go to church; and I have not attempted <hi>that</hi> yet, 
for—it may be foolish weakness, but I am under such constant dread of 
his being snatched away that I am never easy when he is not by my side; 
and I fear these nervous terrors would so entirely disturb my 
devotions, that I should obtain no benefit from the attendance. I mean, 
however, to make the experiment next Sunday, and oblige myself to leave 
him in charge of Rachel for a few hours. It will be a hard task, but 
surely no imprudence; and the vicar has been to scold me for my neglect 
of the ordinances of religion. I had no sufficient excuse to offer, and 
I promised, if all were well, he should see me in my pew next Sunday; 
for I do not wish to be set down as an infidel; and besides, I know I 
should derive great comfort and benefit from an occasional attendance 
at public worship, if I could only have faith and fortitude to compose 
my thoughts in conformity with the solemn occasion, and forbid them to 
be for ever dwelling on my absent child, and on the dreadful 
possibility of finding him gone when I return; and surely God in His 
mercy will preserve me from so severe a trial: for my child's own sake, 
if not for mine, He will not suffer him to be torn away. 
</p>
               <p>November 3rd.—I have made some further acquaintance with my 
neighbours. The fine gentleman and beau of the parish and its vicinity 
(in his own estimation, at least) is a young... 
</p>
               <p>——————- 
</p>
               <p>Here it ended. The rest was torn away. How cruel—just when she was 
going to mention me! for I could not doubt it <hi>was</hi> your humble 
servant she was about to mention, though not very favourably of 
course—I could tell that, as well by those few words as by the 
recollection of her whole aspect and demeanour towards me in the 
commencement of our acquaintance. Well! I could readily forgive her 
prejudice against me, and her hard thoughts of our sex in general, when 
I saw to what brilliant specimens her experience had been limited. 
</p>
               <p>Respecting me, however, she had long since seen her error, and perhaps 
fallen into another in the opposite extreme; for if, at first, her 
opinion of me had been lower than I deserved I was convinced that now 
my deserts were lower than her opinion; and if the former part of this 
continuation had been torn away to avoid wounding my feelings, perhaps 
the latter portion had been removed for fear of ministering too much 
to my self-conceit. At any rate, I would have given much to have seen 
it all—to have witnessed the gradual change, and watched the progress 
of her esteem and friendship for me,—and whatever warmer feeling she 
might have to have seen how much of love there was in her regard, and 
how it had grown upon her in spite of her virtuous resolutions and 
strenuous exertions to—but no, I had no right to see it: all this was 
too sacred for any eyes but her own, and she had done well to keep it 
from me.

               <head>CHAPTER XLV</head>
               <head>RECONCILIATION</head>
               <p>Well Halford, what do you think of all this? and while you read it, 
did you ever picture to yourself what my feelings would probably be 
during its perusal? Most likely not; but I am not going to descant 
upon them now: I will only make this acknowledgement, little 
honourable as it may be to human nature, and especially to 
myself—that the former half of the narrative was, to me, more 
painful than the latter; not that I was at all insensible to Mrs. 
Huntingdon's wrongs or unmoved by her sufferings, but, I must 
confess, I felt a kind of selfish gratification in watching her 
husband's gradual decline in her good graces, and seeing how 
completely he extinguished all her affection at last. The effect of 
the whole, however, in spite of all my sympathy for her and my fury 
against him, was to relieve my mind of an intolerable burden and 
fill my heart with joy, as if some friend had roused me from a 
dreadful night-mare. 
</p>
               <p>It was now near eight o'clock in the morning, for my candle 
had expired in the midst of my perusal, leaving me no alternative 
but to get another, at the expense of alarming the house, or to go 
to bed and wait the return of daylight. On my mother's account, I 
chose the latter; but how <hi>willingly</hi> I sought my pillow, and 
how much sleep it brought me, I leave you to imagine. 
</p>
               <p>     At the first appearance of dawn I rose, and brought the 
manuscript to the window, but it was impossible to read it yet. I 
devoted half an hour to dressing, and then returned to it again. 
Now, with a little difficulty, I could manage; and with intense and 
eager interest, I devoured the remainder of its contents. When it 
was ended, and my transient regret at its abrupt conclusion was 
over, I opened the window and put out my head to catch the cooling 
breeze, and imbibe deep draughts of the pure morning air. A splendid 
morning it was; the half-frozen dew lay thick on the grass, the 
swallows were twittering round me, the rooks cawing and cows lowing 
in the distance; and early frost and summer sunshine mingled their 
sweetness in the air. But I did not think of that: a confusion of 
countless thoughts and varied emotions crowded upon me while I gazed 
abstractedly on the lovely face of nature. Soon, however, this chaos 
of thoughts and passions cleared away, giving place to two distinct 
emotions: joy unspeakable that my adored Helen was all I wished to 
think her—that through the noisome vapours of the world's 
aspersions and my own fancied convictions, her character shone 
bright, and clear, and stainless as that sun I could not bear to 
look on; and shame and deep remorse for my own conduct. 
</p>
               <p>     Immediately after breakfast, I hurried over to Wildfell Hall. 
Rachel had risen many degrees in my estimation since yesterday. I 
was ready to greet her quite as an old friend; but every kindly 
impulse was checked by the look of cold distrust she cast upon me on 
opening the door. The old virgin had constituted herself the 
guardian of her lady's honour, I suppose, and doubtless she saw in 
me another Mr. Hargrave, only the more dangerous in being more 
esteemed and trusted by her mistress. 
</p>
               <p>     `Missis can't see any one to-day, sir—he's poorly,' said she 
in answer to my enquiry for Mrs. Graham. 
</p>
               <p>     `But I must see her, Rachel,' said I, placing my hand on the 
door to prevent its being shut against me. 
</p>
               <p>     `Indeed, sir, you can't,' replied she, settling her 
countenance in still more iron frigidity than before. 
</p>
               <p>     `Be so good as to announce me.' 
</p>
               <p>     `It's no manner of use, Mr. Markham; she's poorly, I tell 
you. 
</p>
               <p>     Just in time to prevent me from committing the impropriety of 
taking the citadel by storm, and pushing forward unannounced, an 
inner door opened, and little Arthur appeared with his frolicsome 
playfellow the dog. He seized my hand between both his, and 
smilingly drew me forward. 
</p>
               <p>     `Mamma says you're to come in, Mr. Markham,' said he, and I'm 
to go out and play with Rover.' 
</p>
               <p>     Rachel retired with a sigh, and I stepped into the parlour and 
shut the door. There, before the fire-place, stood the tall, 
graceful figure wasted with many sorrows. I cast the manuscript on 
the table, and looked in her face. Anxious and pale, it was turned 
towards me; her clear, dark eyes were fixed on mine with a gaze so 
intensely earnest that they bound me like a spell. 
</p>
               <p>     `Have you looked it over?' she murmured. The spell was 
broken. 
</p>
               <p>     `I've read it through,' said I, advancing into the room,—`and 
I want to know if you'll forgive me—if you <hi>can</hi> forgive 
me?' 
</p>
               <p>     She did not answer, but her eyes glistened, and a faint red 
mantled on her lip and cheek. As I approached, she abruptly turned 
away, and went to the window. It was not in anger, I was well 
assured, but only to conceal or control her emotion. I therefore 
ventured to follow and stand beside her there,—but not to speak. 
She gave me her hand, without turning her head, and murmured, in a 
voice she strove in vain to steady,— 
</p>
               <p>     `Can <hi>you</hi> forgive <hi>me</hi>?' 
</p>
               <p>      It might be deemed a breach of trust, I thought, to convey 
that lily hand to my lips, so I only gently pressed it between my 
own, and smilingly replied,— 
</p>
               <p>     `I hardly can. You should have told me this before. It shows a 
want of confidence' 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh, no,' cried she, eagerly interrupting me, `it was not 
that! It was no want of confidence in you; but if I had told you 
anything of my history, I must have told you all, in order to excuse 
my conduct; and I might well shrink from such a disclosure, till 
necessity obliged me to make it. But you forgive me?—I have done 
very, very wrong, I know; but, as usual, I have reaped the bitter 
fruits of my own error,—and must reap them to the end.' 
</p>
               <p>     Bitter indeed, was the tone of anguish, repressed by resolute 
firmness, in which this was spoken. Now, I raised her hand to my 
lips, and fervently kissed it again and again; for tears prevented 
any other reply. She suffered these wild caresses without resistance 
or resentment; then, suddenly turning from me, she paced twice or 
thrice through the room. I knew by the contraction of her brow, the 
tight compression of her lips, and wringing of her hands, that 
meantime a violent conflict between reason and passion, was silently 
passing within. At length she paused before the empty fire-place, 
and turning to me, said calmly—if that might be called calmness, 
which was so evidently the result of a violent effort— 
</p>
               <p>     `Now Gilbert, you must leave me—not this moment, but 
soon—and you must <hi>never come again</hi>.' 
</p>
               <p>      `Never again, Helen? just when I love you more than ever!' 
</p>
               <p>     `For that very reason, if it be so, we should not meet again. 
I thought <hi>this</hi> interview was necessary—at least, I persuaded 
myself it was so—that we might severally ask and receive each 
other's pardon for the past; but there can be no excuse for another. 
I shall leave this place, as soon as I have means to seek another 
asylum; but our intercourse must end here.' 
</p>
               <p>     `End here!' echoed I; and approaching the high, carved 
chimney-piece, I leant my hand against its heavy mouldings, and 
dropped my forehead upon it in silent, sullen despondency. 
</p>
               <p>     `You must not come again,' continued she. There was a slight 
tremor in her voice, but I thought her whole manner was provokingly 
composed, considering the dreadful sentence she pronounced. `You 
must know why I tell you so,' she resumed; `and you must see that it 
is better to part at once:—if it be hard to say adieu for ever, you 
ought to help me.' She paused. I did not answer. `Will you promise 
not to come?—If you won't, and if you do come here again, you will 
drive me away before I know where to find another place of 
refuge—or how to seek it.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Helen,' said I, turning impatiently towards her, `I cannot 
discuss the matter of eternal separation, calmly and dispassionately 
as you can do. It is no question of mere expedience with <hi>me</hi>; 
it is a question of life and death!' 
</p>
               <p>     She was silent. Her pale lips quivered, and her fingers 
trembled with agitation, as she nervously entwined them in the hair 
chain to which was appended her small gold watch—the only thing of 
value she had permitted herself to keep. I had said an unjust and 
cruel thing; but I must needs follow it up with something worse. 
</p>
               <p>     `But Helen!' I began in a soft, low tone, not daring to raise 
my eyes to her face— `that man is <hi>not</hi> your husband: in the 
sight of Heaven he has forfeited all claim to—' She seized my arm 
with a grasp of startling energy. 
</p>
               <p>     `<hi>Gilbert, don't</hi>!' she cried, in a tone that would have 
pierced a heart of adamant. `For God's sake, don't <hi>you</hi>
attempt these arguments! No <hi>fiend</hi> could torture me like 
this!' 
</p>
               <p>     `I won't, I won't!' said I, gently laying my hand on hers; 
almost as much alarmed at her vehemence, as ashamed of my own 
misconduct. 
</p>
               <p>     `Instead of acting like a true friend,' continued she, 
breaking from me and throwing herself into the old arm chair— `and 
helping me with all your might—or rather taking your own part in 
the struggle of right against passion—you leave all the burden to 
me;—and not satisfied with that, you do your utmost to fight 
against me—when you know that I—-' She paused, and hid her face in 
her handkerchief. 
</p>
               <p>     `Forgive me, Helen!' pleaded I, `I will never utter another 
word on the subject. But may we not still meet as friends?' 
</p>
               <p>     `It will not do,' she replied, mournfully shaking her head; 
and then she raised her eyes to mine, with a mildly reproachful look 
that seemed to say, `You must know that as well as I.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Then what <hi>must</hi> we do?' cried I, passionately. But 
immediately I added in a quieter tone— `I'll do whatever you 
desire;—only <hi>don't</hi> say that this meeting is to be our 
last.' 
</p>
               <p>     `And why not? Don't you know that every time we meet, the 
thoughts of the final parting will become more painful? Don't you 
<hi>feel</hi> that every interview makes us dearer to each other than 
the last?' 
</p>
               <p>     The utterance of this last question was hurried and low, and 
the downcast eyes and burning blush too plainly showed that 
<hi>she</hi>, at least, had felt it. It was scarcely prudent to make 
such an admission, or to adds she presently did— `I have power to 
bid you go, now: another time it might be different,'—but I was not 
base enough to attempt to take advantage of her candour. 
</p>
               <p>     `But we may write,' I timidly suggested— `You will not deny 
me that consolation?' 
</p>
               <p>     `We can hear of each other through my brother.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Your brother!' A pang of remorse and shame shot through me. 
She had not heard of the injury he had sustained at my hands; and I 
had not the courage to tell her. `Your brother will not help us,' I 
said: `he would have all communion between us to be entirely at an 
end.' 
</p>
               <p>      `And he would be right, I suppose. As a friend of both, he 
would wish us both well; and every friend would tell us it was our 
interest, as well as our duty, to forget each other, though we might 
not see it ourselves. But don't be afraid, Gilbert,' she added, 
smiling sadly at my manifest discomposure, `there is little chance 
of my forgetting you. But I did not mean that Frederick should be 
the means of transmitting messages between us, only that each might 
know, through him, of the other's welfare;—and more than this ought 
not to be; for you are young, Gilbert, and you ought to marry—and 
will some time, though you may think it impossible now:—and though 
I hardly can say I wish you to forget me, I know it is right that 
you should, both for your own happiness and that of your future 
wife;—and therefore I must and will wish it,' she added 
resolutely. 
</p>
               <p>     `And you are young too, Helen,' I boldly replied, `and when 
that profligate scoundrel has run through his career, you will give 
your hand to me—I'll wait till then.' 
</p>
               <p>     But she would not leave me this support. Independently of the 
moral evil of basing our hopes upon the death of another, who, if 
unfit for this world, was at least no less so for the next, and 
whose amelioration would thus become our bane and his greatest 
transgression our greatest benefit,—she maintained it to be 
madness: many men of Mr. Huntingdon's habits had lived to a ripe 
though miserable old age;— `and if I,' said she, `am young in years 
I am old in sorrow; but even if trouble should fail to kill me 
before vice destroys him, think, if he reached but fifty years or 
so, would you wait twenty or fifteen—in vague uncertainty and 
suspense—through all the prime of youth and manhood—and marry at 
last a woman faded and worn as I shall be—without ever having seen 
me from this day to that?—You would not,' she continued, 
interrupting my earnest protestations of unfailing constancy,— `or 
if you would you should not. Trust me, Gilbert; in this matter I 
know better than you. You think me cold and stony hearted, and you 
may, but—' 
</p>
               <p>     `I don't Helen.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Well, never mind; you might if you would—but I have not 
spent my solitude in utter idleness, and I am not speaking now from 
the impulse of the moment as you do: I have thought of all these 
matters again and again; I have argued these questions with myself, 
and pondered well our past, and present, and future career; and, 
believe me, I have come to the right conclusion at last. Trust my 
words rather than your own feelings, now, and in a few years you 
will see that I was right—though at present I hardly can see it 
myself,' she murmured with a sigh as she rested her head on her 
hand.— `And don't argue against me any more: all you can say has 
been already said by my own heart and refuted by my reason. It was 
hard enough to combat those suggestions as they were whispered 
within me; in your mouth they are ten times worse, and if you knew 
how much they pain me you would cease at once, I know. If you knew 
my present feelings, you would even try to relieve them at the 
expense of your own. 
</p>
               <p>     `I will goon a minute, if <hi>that</hi> can relieve you—and 
NEVER return!' said I with bitter emphasis.— `But, if we may never 
meet, and never hope to meet again, is it a crime to exchange our 
thoughts by letter? May not kindred spirits meet, and mingle in 
communion whatever be the fate and circumstances of their earthly 
tenements?' 
</p>
               <p>     `They may, they may!' cried she with a momentary burst of glad 
enthusiasm. `I thought of that too, Gilbert, but I feared to mention 
it, because I feared you would not understand my views upon the 
subject—I fear it even now—I fear any kind friend would tell us we 
are <hi>both</hi> deluding ourselves with the idea of keeping up a 
spiritual intercourse without hope or prospect of anything 
further—without fostering vain regrets and hurtful aspirations, and 
feeding thoughts that should be sternly and pitilessly left to 
perish of inanition—' 
</p>
               <p>     `Never mind our kind friends: if they can part our bodies, it 
is enough; in God's name, let them not sunder our souls!' cried I, 
in terror lest she should deem it her duty to deny us this last 
remaining consolation. 
</p>
               <p>     `But no letters can pass between us here,' said she, `without 
giving fresh food for scandal; and when I departed, I had intended 
that my new abode should be unknown to you as to the rest of the 
world; not that I should doubt your word if you promised not to 
visit me, but I thought you would be more tranquil in your own mind 
if you knew you could not do it; and likely to find less difficulty 
in abstracting yourself from me if you could not picture my 
situation to your mind. But listen,' said she, smilingly putting up 
her finger to check my impatient reply: `in six months you shall 
hear from Frederick precisely where I am; and if you still retain 
your wish to write to me, and think you can maintain a 
correspondence all thought, all spirit—such as disembodied souls or 
unimpassioned friends, at least, might hold,—write, and I will 
answer you.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Six months!' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes, to give your present ardour time to cool and try the 
truth and constancy of your soul's love for mine. And now, enough 
has been said between us.—Why can't we part at once!' exclaimed she 
almost wildly, after a moment's pause, as she suddenly rose from her 
chair with her hands resolutely clasped together. I thought it was 
my duty to go without delay; and I approached and half extended my 
hand as if to take leave; she grasped it in silence. But this 
thought of final separation was too intolerable: it seemed to 
squeeze the blood out of my heart; and my feet were glued to the 
floor. 
</p>
               <p>     `And must we never meet again?' I murmured in the anguish of 
my soul. 
</p>
               <p>     `We shall meet in Heaven. Let us think of that,' said she in a 
tone of desperate calmness; but her eyes glittered wildly, and her 
face was deadly pale. 
</p>
               <p>     `But not as we are now, I could not help replying. `It gives 
me little consolation to think I shall next behold you as a 
disembodied spirit, or an altered being, with a frame perfect and 
glorious, but not like this!—and a heart, perhaps, entirely 
estranged from me. 
</p>
               <p>     `No Gilbert, there is perfect love in Heaven!' 
</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>`So</hi> perfect, I suppose, that it soars above 
distinctions, and you will have no closer sympathy with me than with 
any one of the ten thousand thousand angels' and the innumerable 
multitude of happy spirits round us.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Whatever I am, you will be the same, and therefore, cannot 
possibly regret it; and whatever that change may be, we know it must 
be for the better.' 
</p>
               <p>     `But if I am to be so changed that I shall cease to adore you 
with my whole heart and soul, and love you beyond every other 
creature, I shall not be myself, and, though, if ever I win Heaven 
at all, I must, I know, be infinitely better and happier than I am 
now, my earthly nature cannot rejoice in the anticipation of such 
beatitude, from which itself and its chief joy must be excluded.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Is your love <hi>all</hi> earthly then?' 
</p>
               <p>     `No, but I am supposing we shall have no more intimate 
communion with each other, than with the rest.' 
</p>
               <p>     `If so, it will be because we love them more and not each 
other less. Increase of love brings increase of happiness, when it 
is mutual, and pure as that will be.' 
</p>
               <p>     `But can <hi>you,</hi> Helen, contemplate with delight this 
prospect of losing me in a sea of glory?' 
</p>
               <p>     `I own I cannot; but we know not that it will be so;—and I do 
know that to regret the exchange of earthly pleasures for the joys 
of Heaven, is as if the grovelling caterpillar should lament that it 
must one day quit the nibbled leaf to soar aloft and flutter through 
the air, roving at will from flower to flower, sipping sweet honey 
from their cups or basking in their sunny petals. If these little 
creatures knew how great a change awaited them, no doubt they would 
regret it; but would not all such sorrow be misplaced? And if that 
illustration will not move you, here is another:—We are children 
now; we feel as children, and we understand as children; and when we 
are told that men and women do not play with toys, and that our 
companions will one day weary of the trivial sports and occupations 
that interest them and us so deeply now, we cannot help being 
saddened at the thoughts of such an alteration, because we cannot 
conceive that as we grow up, our own minds will become so enlarged 
and elevated that we ourselves shall then regard as trifling those 
objects and pursuits we now so fondly cherish, and that, though our 
companions will no longer join us in those childish pastimes, they 
will drink with us at other fountains of delight, and mingle their 
souls with ours in higher aims and nobler occupations beyond our 
present comprehension, but not less deeply relished or less truly 
good for that,—while yet both we and they remain essentially the 
same individuals as before. But Gilbert, can you really derive no 
consolation from the thought that we may meet together where there 
is no more pain and sorrow, no more striving against sin, and 
struggling of the spirit against the flesh; where both will behold 
the same glorious truths, and drink exalted and supreme felicity 
from the same fountain of light and goodness—that Being whom both 
will worship with the same intensity of holy ardour, and whose pure 
and happy creatures both will love with the same divine affection? 
If you cannot, never write to me!' 
</p>
               <p>     `Helen, I can, if faith would never fail.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Now, then,' exclaimed she, `while this hope is strong within 
us—' 
</p>
               <p>     `We will part,' I cried. `You shall not have the pain of 
another effort to dismiss me: I will go at once; but—' 
</p>
               <p>     I did not put my request in words: she understood it 
instinctively and <hi>this</hi> time she yielded too—or rather, there 
was nothing so deliberate as requesting or yielding in the matter: 
there was a sudden impulse that neither could resist. One moment I 
stood and looked into her face, the next I held her to my heart, and 
we seemed to grow together in a close embrace from which no physical 
or mental force could rend us. A whispered `God bless you!' and 
`Go—go!' was all she said; but while she spoke, she held me so fast 
that, without violence, I could not have obeyed her. At length, 
however, by some heroic effort, we tore ourselves apart, and I 
rushed from the house. 
</p>
               <p>     I have a confused remembrance of seeing little Arthur running 
up the garden walk to meet me, and of bolting over the wall to avoid 
him—and subsequently running down the steep fields, clearing the 
stone fences and hedges as they came in my way, till I got 
completely out of sight of the old Hall and down to the bottom of 
the hill; and then of long hours spent in bitter tears and 
lamentations, and melancholy musings in the lonely valley, with the 
eternal music in my ears, of the west wind rushing through the 
over-shadowing trees, and the brook babbling and gurgling along its 
stony bed—my eyes, for the most part, vacantly fixed on the deep, 
checkered shades restlessly playing over the bright sunny grass at 
my feet, where now and then a withered leaf or two would come 
dancing to share the revelry, but my heart was away up the hill in 
that dark room where she was weeping desolate and alone—she whom I 
was not to comfort, not to see again, till years or suffering had 
overcome us both, and torn our spirits from their perishing abodes 
of clay. 
</p>
               <p>     There was little business done that day, you may be sure. The 
farm was abandoned to the labourers, and the labourers were left to 
their own devices. But one duty must be attended to: I had not 
forgotten my assault upon Frederick Lawrence; and I must see him to 
apologize for the unhappy deed. I would fain have put it off till 
the morrow; but what if he should denounce me to his sister in the 
mean time? No, no, I must ask his pardon to-day, and intreat him to 
be lenient in his accusation, if the revelation must be made. I 
deferred it however, till the evening, when my spirits were more 
composed and when—oh, wonderful perversity of human nature!—some 
faint germs of indefinite hopes were beginning to rise in my mind; 
not that I intended to cherish them after all that had been said on 
the subject, but there they must lie for a while, uncrushed though 
not encouraged, till I had learnt to live without them. 
</p>
               <p>     Arrived at Woodford, the young squire's abode, I found no 
little difficulty in obtaining admission to his presence. The 
servant that opened the door told me his master was very ill, and 
seemed to think it doubtful whether he would be able to see me. I 
was not going to be balked however. I waited calmly in the hall to 
be announced, but inwardly determined to take no denial. The message 
was such as I expected—polite intimation that Mr. Lawrence could 
see no one; he was feverish and must not be disturbed. 
</p>
               <p>     `I shall not disturb him long,' said I; `but I must see him 
for a moment: it is on business of importance that I wish to speak 
to him.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I'll tell him sir,' said the man. And I advanced farther into 
the hall and followed him nearly to the door of the apartment where 
his master was—for it seemed he was not in bed. The answer 
returned, was that Mr. Lawrence hoped I would be so good as to leave 
a message or a note with the servant, as he could attend to no 
business at present. 
</p>
               <p>     `He may as well see me as you,' said I; and, stepping past the 
astonished footman, I boldly rapped at the door, entered, and closed 
it behind me. The room was spacious and handsomely furnished—very 
comfortably, too, for a bachelor. A clear, red fire was burning in 
the polished grate: a superannuated greyhound, given up to idleness 
and good living lay basking before it on the thick, soft rug, on one 
corner of which, beside the sola, sat a smart young springer, 
looking wistfully up in its master's face; perhaps, asking 
permission to share his couch, or, it might be, only soliciting a 
caress from his hand or a kind word from his lips. The invalid 
himself looked very interesting as he lay reclining there, in his 
elegant dressing-gown, with a silk handkerchief bound across his 
temples. His usually pale face was flushed and feverish; his eyes 
were half closed, until he became sensible of my presence—and then 
he opened them wide enough—one hand was thrown listlessly over the 
back of the sofa, and held a small volume with which, apparently, he 
had been vainly attempting to beguile the weary hours. He dropped 
it, however, in his start of indignant surprise as I advanced into 
the room and stood before him on the rug. He raised himself on his 
pillows and gazed upon me with equal degrees of nervous horror, 
anger, and amazement depicted on his countenance. 
</p>
               <p>     `Mr. Markham, I scarcely expected this!' he said; and the 
blood left his cheek as he spoke. 
</p>
               <p>     `I know you didn't,' answered I; `but be quiet a minute, and 
I'll tell you what I came for.' Unthinkingly I advanced a step or 
two nearer. He winced at my approach, with an expression of aversion 
and instinctive physical fear anything but conciliatory to my 
feelings. I stepped back however. 
</p>
               <p>     `Make your story a short one,' said he, putting his hand on 
the small silver bell that stood on the table beside him,— `or I 
shall be obliged to call for assistance. I am in no state to bear 
your brutalities now, or your presence either.' And in truth the 
moisture started from his pores and stood on his pale forehead like 
dew. 
</p>
               <p>     Such a reception was hardly calculated to diminish the 
difficulties of my unenviable task. It must be performed, however, 
in some fashion; and so I plunged into it at once, and floundered 
through it as I could. 
</p>
               <p>     `The truth is, Lawrence,' said I, `I have not acted quite 
correctly towards you of late—especially on this last occasion; and 
I'm come thin short, to express my regret for what has been done, 
and to beg your pardon.—If you don't choose to grant it,' I added 
hastily, not liking the aspect of his face, `it's no matter—only, 
<hi>I've</hi> done <hi>my</hi> duty—that's all.' 
</p>
               <p>     `It's easily done,' replied he, with a faint smile bordering 
on a sneer: `to abuse your friend and knock him on the head, without 
any assignable cause, and then tell him the deed was not quite 
correct, but it's no matter whether he pardons it or not. 
</p>
               <p>     `I forgot to tell you that it was in consequence of a 
mistake,' muttered I. `I should have made a very handsome apology, 
but you provoked me so confoundedly with your—-. Well, I suppose 
it's my fault. The fact is, I didn't know that you were Mrs. 
Graham's brother, and I saw and heard some things respecting your 
conduct towards her, which were calculated to awaken unpleasant 
suspicions, that allow me to say, a little candour and confidence on 
your part might have removed; and at last, I chanced to overhear a 
part of a conversation between you and her that made me think I had 
a right to hate you. 
</p>
               <p>     `And how came you to know that I was her brother?' asked he in 
some anxiety. 
</p>
               <p>     `She told me herself. She told me all. <hi>She</hi> knew I might 
be trusted. But you needn't disturb' yourself about <hi>that</hi>, Mr. 
Lawrence, for I've seen the last of her!' 
</p>
               <p>     `The last! is she gone then?' 
</p>
               <p>     `No, but she has bid adieu to me; and I have promised never to 
go near that house again while she inhabits it.' I could have 
groaned aloud at the bitter thoughts awakened by this turn in the 
discourse. But I only clenched my hands, and stamped my foot upon 
the rug. My companion however, was evidently relieved. 
</p>
               <p>     `You have done right!' he said in a tone of unqualified 
approbation, while his face brightened into almost a sunny 
expression. `And as for the mistake, I am sorry for both our sakes 
that it should have occurred. Perhaps you can forgive my want of 
candour, and remember, as some partial mitigation of the offence, 
how little encouragement to friendly confidence you have given me of 
late.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes, yes, I remember it all: nobody can blame me more than I 
blame myself in my own heart—at any rate, nobody can regret more 
sincerely than I do the result of my <hi>brutality</hi> as you rightly 
term it.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Never mind that,' said he, faintly smiling; `let us forget 
all unpleasant words on both sides, as well as deeds, and consign to 
oblivion everything that we have cause to regret. Have you any 
objection to take my hand—or you'd rather not?' It trembled through 
weakness, as he held it out, and dropped before I had time to catch 
it and give it a hearty squeeze, which he had not the strength to 
return. 
</p>
               <p>     `How dry and burning your hand is Lawrence,' said I. `You are 
really ill, and I have made you worse by all this talk.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh, it is nothing: only a cold got by the rain.' 
</p>
               <p>     `My doing, too.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Never mind that—but tell me, did you mention this affair to 
my sister?' 
</p>
               <p>     `To confess the truth, I had not the courage to do so; but 
when you tell her, will you just say that I deeply regret it, 
and—' 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh, never fear! I shall say nothing against you, as long as 
you keep your good resolution of remaining aloof from her. She has 
not heard of my illness then, that you are aware of?' 
</p>
               <p>     `I think not.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I'm glad of that, for I have been all this time tormenting 
myself with the fear that somebody would tell her I was dying, or 
desperately ill, and she would be either distressing herself on 
account of her inability to hear from me or do me any good, or 
perhaps committing the madness of coming to see me. I must contrive 
to let her know something about it, if I can,' continued he 
reflectively, `or she will be hearing some such story. Many would be 
glad to tell her such news, just to see how she would take it; and 
then she might expose herself to fresh scandal.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I wish I had told her,' said I. `If it were not for my 
promise, I would tell her now. 
</p>
               <p>     `By no means! I am not dreaming of that;—but if I were to 
write a short note, now—not mentioning you, Markham, but just 
giving a slight account of my illness, by way of excuse for my not 
coming to see her, and to put her on her guard against any 
exaggerated reports she may hear,—and address it in a disguised 
hand—would you do me the favour to slip it into the post-office as 
you pass? for I dare not trust any of the servants in such a 
case. 
</p>
               <p>     Most willingly I consented, and immediately brought him his 
desk. There was little need to disguise his hand, for the poor 
fellow seemed to have considerable difficulty in writing at all, so 
as to be legible. When the note was done, I thought it time to 
retire, and took leave after asking if there was anything in the 
world I could do for him, little or great, in the way of alleviating 
his sufferings, and repairing the injury I had done. 
</p>
               <p>     `No,' said he; `you have already done much towards it; you 
have done more for me than the most skilful physician could do; for 
you have relieved my mind of two great burdens—anxiety on my 
sister's account, and deep regret upon your own, for I do believe 
these two sources of torment have had more effect in working me up 
into a fever, than anything else; and I am persuaded I shall soon 
recover now. There is one more thing you can do for me, and that is, 
come and see me now and then—for you see I am very lonely here, and 
I promise your entrance shall not be disputed again.' 
</p>
               <p>I engaged to do so, and departed with a cordial pressure of 
the hand. I posted the letter on my way home, most manfully 
resisting the temptation of dropping in a word from myself at the 
same time.

               <head>CHAPTER XLVI</head>
               <head>FRIENDLY COUNSELS</head>
               <p>I felt strongly tempted, at times, to enlighten my mother and sister 
on the real character and circumstances of the persecuted tenant of 
Wildfell Hall; and at first I greatly regretted having omitted to ask 
that lady's permission to do so; but, on due reflection, I considered 
that if it were known to them, it could not long remain a secret to the 
Millwards and Wilsons, and such was my present appreciation of Eliza 
Millward's disposition, that, if once she got a clue to the story, I 
should fear she would soon find means to enlighten Mr. Huntingdon upon 
the place of his wife's retreat. I would therefore wait patiently till 
these weary six months were over, and then, when the fugitive had found 
another home, and I was permitted to write to her, I would beg to be 
allowed to clear her name from these vile calumnies: at present I must 
content myself with simply asserting that I knew them to be false, and 
would prove it some day, to the shame of those who slandered her. I 
don't think anybody believed me: but everybody soon learned to avoid 
insinuating a word against her, or even mentioning her name in my 
presence. They thought I was so madly infatuated by the seductions of 
that unhappy lady that I was determined to support her in the very face 
of reason; and meantime I grew insupportably morose and misanthropical 
from the idea that every one I met was harbouring unworthy thoughts of 
the supposed Mrs. Graham, and would express them if he dared. My poor 
mother was quite distressed about me; but I couldn't help it—at least 
I thought I could not; though sometimes I felt a pang of remorse for 
my undutiful conduct to her, and made an effort to amend, attended with 
some partial success—and indeed I was generally more humanized in my 
demeanour to her than to any one else, Mr. Lawrence excepted. Rose and 
Fergus usually shunned my presence; and it was well they did, for I was 
not fit company for them, nor they for me, under the present 
circumstances. 
</p>
               <p>Mrs. Huntingdon did not leave Wildfell Hall till above two months 
after our farewell interview. During that time she never appeared at 
church, and I never went near the house: I only knew she was still 
there by her brother's brief answers to my many and varied enquiries 
respecting her. I was a very constant and attentive visitor to him 
throughout the whole period of his illness and convalescence; not only 
from the interest I took in his recovery, and my desire to cheer him 
up and make the utmost possible amends for my former `brutality,' but 
from my growing attachment to himself, and the increasing pleasure I 
found in his society—partly, from his increased cordiality to me, but 
chiefly . on account of his close connection—both in blood and in 
affection—with my adored Helen. I loved him for it better than I liked 
to express; and I took a secret delight in pressing those slender, 
white fingers, so marvellously like her own, considering `he was not 
a woman, and in watching the passing changes in his fair, pale 
features, and observing the intonations of his voice—detecting 
resemblances which I wondered had never struck me before. He provoked 
me at times, indeed, by his evident reluctance to talk to me about.his 
sister, though I did not question the friendliness of his motives in 
wishing to discourage my remembrance of her. 
</p>
               <p>     His recovery was not quite so rapid as he had expected it to be: 
he was not able to mount his pony till a fortnight after the date of 
our reconciliation; and the first use he made of his returning 
strength, was to ride over by night to Wildfell Hall, to see his 
sister. It was a hazardous enterprise both for him and for her, but he 
thought it necessary to consult with her on the subject of her 
projected departure, if not to calm her apprehensions respecting his 
health, and the worst result was a slight relapse of his illness; for 
no one knew of the visit, but the inmates of the old Hall—except 
myself, and I believe it had not been his intention to mention it to 
me, for when I came to see him the next day, and observed he was not 
so well as he ought to have been, he merely said he had caught cold by 
being out too late in the evening. 
</p>
               <p>     `You'll <hi>never</hi> be able to see your sister, if you don't 
take care of yourself,' said I, a little provoked at the circumstance 
on her account, instead of commiserating him. 
</p>
               <p>     `I've seen her already,' said he, quietly. 
</p>
               <p>     `You've seen her!' cried I, in astonishment. 
</p>
               <p>      `Yes.' And then he told me what considerations had impelled him 
to make the venture, and with what precautions he had made it. 
</p>
               <p>     `And how was she?' I eagerly asked. 
</p>
               <p>     `As usual,' was the brief though sad reply. 
</p>
               <p>     `As usual—that is, far from happy and far from strong.' 
</p>
               <p>     `She is not positively ill,' returned he; `and she will recover 
her spirits in a while I have no doubt—But so many trials have been 
almost too much for her. How threatening those clouds look!' continued 
he, turning towards the window. `We shall have thunder showers before 
night, I imagine; and they are just in the midst of stacking my corn. 
Have you got yours all in yet?' 
</p>
               <p>     `No.—And Lawrence, did she—did your sister mention me?' 
</p>
               <p>     `She asked if I had seen you lately.' 
</p>
               <p>     `And what else did she say?' 
</p>
               <p>     `I cannot tell you all she said,' replied he with a slight smile, 
`for we talked a good deal, though my stay was but short; but our 
conversation was chiefly on the subject of her intended departure, 
which I begged her to delay till I was better able to assist her in her 
search after another home.' 
</p>
               <p>     `But did she say no more about me?' 
</p>
               <p>     `She did not say much about you, Markham. I should not have 
encouraged her to do so, had she been inclined; but happily she was 
not: she only asked a few questions concerning you, and seemed 
satisfied with my brief answers; wherein she showed herself wiser than 
her friend—and I may tell you too, that she seemed to be far more 
anxious lest you should think too much of her, than lest you should 
forget her.' 
</p>
               <p>     `She was right.' 
</p>
               <p>     `But I fear <hi>your</hi> anxiety is quite the other way, 
respecting her.' 
</p>
               <p>     `No, it is not: I wish her to be happy; but I don't wish her to 
forget me altogether. She knows it is impossible that I should forget 
<hi>her;</hi> and she is right to wish me not to remember her too well. 
I should not desire her to regret me <hi>too</hi> deeply; but I can 
scarcely imagine she will make herself very unhappy about me, because 
I know I am not worthy of it, except in my appreciation of her.' 
</p>
               <p>     `You are neither of you worthy of a broken heart,—nor of all the sighs, 
and tears, 
and sorrowful thoughts that have been, and I fear will be wasted upon you 
both; but at 
present, each has a more exalted opinion of the other than, I fear, he or she 
deserves; and 
my sister's feelings are naturally full as keen as yours, and I believe 
<hi>more</hi>
constant; but she has the good sense and fortitude to strive against them in 
this particular; 
and I trust she will not rest till she has entirely weaned her thoughts—' he 
hesitated. 
</p>
               <p>     `From me,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>     `And I wish you would make the like exertions,' continued he. 
</p>
               <p>     `Did she <hi>tell</hi> you that that was her intention?' 
</p>
               <p>     `No; the question was not broached between us: there was no necessity 
for it, for I 
had no doubt that such was her determination. 
</p>
               <p>     `To forget me?' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes Markham! Why not?' 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh! well,' was my only audible reply; but I internally answered,—`No, 
Lawrence, 
you're wrong there, she is <hi>not</hi> determined to forget me. It would be 
<hi>wrong</hi>
to forget one so deeply and fondly devoted to her, who can so thoroughly 
appreciate her 
excellencies and sympathize with all her thoughts as I can do, and it would 
be wrong in 
me to forget so excellent and divine a piece of God's creation as she, when I 
have once so 
truly loved and known her.' But I said no more to him on that subject. I 
instantly started a 
new topic of conversation, and soon took leave of my. companion, with a 
feeling of less 
cordiality towards him than usual. Perhaps I had no right to be annoyed at 
him, but I was 
so nevertheless. 
</p>
               <p>     In little more than a week after this, I met him returning from a visit 
to the 
Wilsons; and I now resolved to do <hi>him</hi> a good turn, though at the 
expense of his 
feelings, and, perhaps, at the risk of incurring that displeasure which is so 
commonly the 
reward of those who give disagreeable information or tender their advice 
unasked. In this, 
believe me, I was actuated by no motives of revenge for the occasional 
annoyances I had 
lately sustained from him,—nor yet by any feeling of malevolent enmity 
towards Miss 
Wilson, but purely by the fact that I could not endure that such a woman 
should be Mrs. 
Huntingdon's sister, 
and that, as well for his own sake as for hers, I could not bear to 
think of his being deceived into a union with one so unworthy of him, 
and so utterly unfitted to be the partner of his quiet home, and the 
companion of his life. He had had uncomfortable suspicions on that head 
himself, I imagined, but such was his inexperience, and such were the 
lady's powers of attraction and her skill in bringing them to bear upon 
his young imagination, that they had not disturbed him long, and I 
believe the only effectual cause of the vacillating indecision that had 
preserved him hitherto from making an actual declaration of love, was 
the consideration of her connections, and especially of her mother, 
whom he could not abide. Had they lived at a distance, he might have 
surmounted the objection, but within two or three miles of Woodford, 
it was really no light matter. 
</p>
               <p>     `You've been to call on the Wilsons, Lawrence,' said I as I 
walked beside his pony. 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes,' replied he, slightly averting his face: `I thought it but 
civil to take the first opportunity of returning their kind attentions, 
since they have been so very particular and constant in their 
enquiries, throughout the whole course of my illness.' 
</p>
               <p>     `It's all Miss Wilson's doing.' 
</p>
               <p>     `And if it is,' returned he, with a very perceptible blush, `is 
that any reason why I should not make a suitable acknowledgment?' 
</p>
               <p>     `It is a reason why you should not make the acknowledgment she 
looks for.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Let us drop that subject if you please,' said he in evident 
displeasure. 
</p>
               <p>     `No, Lawrence, with your leave we'll continue it a while longer; 
and I'll tell you something, now we're about it, which you may believe 
or not as you choose—only please to remember that it is not my custom 
to speak falsely, and that in this case, I can have no motive for 
misrepresenting the truth—' 
</p>
               <p>     `Well, Markham! what now?' 
</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>`Miss Wilson hates your sister.</hi> It may be natural enough 
that, in her ignorance of the relationship, she should feel some degree 
of enmity against her, but no good or amiable woman would be capable 
of evincing that bitter, cold-blooded, designing malice towards a 
fancied rival that I have observed in her.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Markham!!' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes—and it is my belief that Eliza Millward and she, if not the 
very originators of the slanderous reports that have been propagated, 
were designedly the encouragers and chief disseminators of them. She 
was not desirous to mix up <hi>your</hi> name in the matter, of course, 
but her delight was, and still is, to blacken your sister's character 
to the utmost of her power without risking too greatly the exposure of 
her own malevolence!' 
</p>
               <p>     `I cannot believe it,' interrupted my companion, his face burning 
with indignation. 
</p>
               <p>     `Well, as I cannot prove it, I must content myself with asserting 
that it <hi>is</hi> so to the best of my belief, but as you would not 
willingly marry Miss Wilson if it <hi>mere</hi> so, you will do well to 
be cautious, till you have proved it to be otherwise.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I never told you, Markham, that I <hi>intended</hi> to marry Miss 
Wilson,' said he proudly. 
</p>
               <p>     `No, but whether you do or not, she intends to marry you.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Did she tell you so?' 
</p>
               <p>     `No, but—' 
</p>
               <p>     `Then you have no right to make such an assertion respecting 
her.' He slightly quickened his pony's pace, but I laid my hand on its 
mane, determined he should not leave me yet. 
</p>
               <p>     `Wait a moment, Lawrence, and let me explain myself, and don't 
be so very—I don't know what to call it—<hi>inaccessible</hi> as you 
are.a know what you think of Jane Wilson; and I believe I know how far 
you are mistaken in your opinion: you think she is singularly charming, 
elegant, sensible, and refined: you are not aware that she is selfish, 
cold-hearted, ambitious, artful, shallow-minded—' 
</p>
               <p>     `Enough, Markham, enough.' 
</p>
               <p>     `No; let me finish.—You don't know that, if you married her, 
your home would be rayless and comfortless; and it would break your 
heart at last to find yourself united to one so wholly incapable of 
sharing your tastes, feelings, and ideas—so utterly destitute of 
sensibility, good feeling, and true nobility of soul.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Have you done?' asked my companion quietly. 
</p>
               <p>      `Yes;—I know you hate me for my impertinence, but I don't care 
if it only conduces to preserve you from that fatal mistake.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Well!' returned he, with a rather wintry smile—`I'm glad you 
have overcome, or forgotten your own afflictions so far as to be able 
to study so deeply the affairs of others, and trouble your head, so 
unnecessarily, about the fancied or possible calamities of their future 
life.' 
</p>
               <p>     We parted—somewhat coldly again; but still we did not cease to 
be friends; and my well-meant warning, though it might have been more 
judiciously delivered, as well as more thankfully received, was not 
wholly unproductive of the desired effect: his visit to the Wilsons was 
not repeated, and, though, in our subsequent interviews, he never 
mentioned her name to me, nor I to him,—I have reason to believe he 
pondered my words in his mind, eagerly though covertly sought 
information respecting the fair lady from other quarters, secretly 
compared my character of her with what he had himself observed and what 
he heard from others, and finally came to the conclusion that, all 
things considered, she had much better remain Miss Wilson of Ryecote 
Farm, than be transmuted into Mrs. Lawrence of Woodford Hall. I 
believe, too, that he soon learned to contemplate with secret amazement 
his former predilection, and to congratulate himself on the lucky 
escape he had made; but he never confessed it to me, or hinted one word 
of acknowledgment for the part I had had in his deliverance—but this 
was not surprising to any one that knew him as I did. 
</p>
               <p>     As for Jane Wilson, she, of course, was disappointed and 
embittered by the sudden cold neglect, and ultimate desertion of her 
former admirer. Had I done wrong to blight her cherished hopes? I think 
not; and certainly my conscience has never accused me, from that day 
to this, of any evil design in the matter.

               <head>CHAPTER XLVII</head>
               <head>STARTLING INTELLIGENCE</head>
               <p>One morning, about the beginning of November, while I was inditing some 
business letters, shortly after breakfast, Eliza Millward came to call 
upon my sister. Rose had neither the discrimination nor the virulence 
to regard the little demon as I did, and they still preserved their 
former intimacy. At the moment of her arrival, however, there was no 
one in the room but Fergus and myself, my mother and sister being both 
of them absent, `on household cares intent;” but <hi>I</hi> was not going 
to lay myself out for her amusement, whoever else might so incline: I 
merely honoured her with a careless salutation and a few words of 
course,' and then went on with my writing, leaving my brother to be 
more polite if he chose. But she wanted to teaze me. 
</p>
               <p>`What a pleasure it is to find you at home, Mr. Markham!' said she, 
with a disingenuously malicious smile. `I so seldom see you now, for 
you never come to the vicarage. Papa is quite offended I can tell you,' 
she added playfully, looking into my face with an impertinent laugh, 
as she seated herself, half beside and half before my desk, off the 
corner of the table. 
</p>
               <p>`I have had a good deal to do of late,' said I, without looking up from 
my letter. 
</p>
               <p>`Have you indeed! Somebody said you had been strangely neglecting your 
business these last few months.' 
</p>
               <p>`Somebody said wrong, for, these last <hi>two</hi> months especially, I 
have been particularly plodding and diligent.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! Well, there's nothing like active employment, I suppose, to 
console the afflicted;—and, excuse me, Mr. Markham, but you look so 
very far from well, and have been, by all accounts, so moody and 
thoughtful of late,—I could almost think you have some secret care 
preying on your spirits. <hi>Formerly</hi>,' said she timidly, `I could 
have ventured to ask you what it was, and what I could do to comfort 
you: I dare not do it now.' 
</p>
               <p>`You're very kind, Miss Eliza. When I think you can do anything to 
comfort me, I'll make bold to tell you.' 
</p>
               <p>`Pray do—I suppose I mayn't guess what it is that troubles you?' 
</p>
               <p>`There's no necessity, for I'll tell you plainly. The thing that 
troubles me the most at present, is a young lady sitting at my elbow, 
and preventing me from finishing my letter, and thereafter, repairing 
to my daily business.' 
</p>
               <p>Before she could reply to this ungallant speech, Rose entered the room; 
and Miss Eliza rising to greet her, they both seated themselves near 
the fire, where that idle lad, Fergus, was standing, leaning his 
shoulder against the corner of the chimneypiece with his legs crossed 
and his hands in his breeches pockets. 
</p>
               <p>`Now, Rose, I'll tell you a piece of news—I hope you've not heard it 
before, for good, bad or indifferent, one always likes to be the first 
to tell.—It's about that sad Mrs. Graham 
</p>
               <p>`Hush—sh—sh!' whispered Fergus, in a tone of solemn import. `”We 
never mention her; her name is never heard.”' And glancing up, I caught 
him with his eye askance on me, and his finger pointed to his forehead; 
then, winking at the young lady with a doleful shake of the head, he 
whispered—a monomania—But don't mention it—all right but that.' 
</p>
               <p>`I should be sorry to injure any one's feelings,' returned she, 
speaking below her breath, `another time, perhaps.' 
</p>
               <p>`Speak out, Miss Eliza!' said I, not deigning to notice the other's 
buffooneries, `you needn't fear to say anything in my presence—that 
is <hi>true</hi>.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well,' answered she, `perhaps you know already that Mrs. Graham's 
husband is not really dead, and that she had run away from him?' I 
started, and felt my face glow; but I bent it over my letter, and went 
on folding it up as she proceeded, `but perhaps you did <hi>not</hi> know 
that she is now gone back to him again, and that a perfect 
reconciliation has taken place between them? Only think,' she 
continued, turning to the confounded Rose, `what a fool the man must 
be!' 
</p>
               <p>`And who gave you this piece of intelligence, Miss Eliza?' said I, 
interrupting my sister's exclamations. 
</p>
               <p>`I had it from a very authentic source, sir.' 
</p>
               <p>`From whom, may I ask?' 
</p>
               <p>`From one of the servants at Woodford.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! I was not aware that you were on such intimate terms with Mr. 
Lawrence's household.' 
</p>
               <p>`It was not from the man himself, that I heard it; but he told it in 
confidence to our maid Sarah, and Sarah told it to me.' 
</p>
               <p>`In confidence, I suppose; and you tell it in confidence to us; but 
<hi>I</hi> can tell <hi>you</hi> that it is but a lame story after all, and 
scarcely one half of it true.' 
</p>
               <p>While I spoke, I completed the sealing and direction of my letters, 
with a somewhat unsteady hand, in spite of all my efforts to retain 
composure, and in spite of my firm conviction that the story <hi>was</hi>
a lame one—that the supposed Mrs. Graham, most certainly, had not 
<hi>voluntarily</hi> gone back to her husband, or dreamt of a 
reconciliation. Most likely, she was gone away, and the tale-bearing 
servant, not knowing what was become of her, had <hi>conjectured</hi>
that such was the case, and our fair visitor had detailed it as a 
certainty, delighted with such an opportunity of tormenting me. But it 
was possible—rarely possible, that some one might have betrayed her, 
and she had been taken away by force. Determined to know the worst, I 
hastily pocketed my two letters, and muttering something about being 
too late for the post, left the room, rushed into the yard and 
vociferously called for my horse. No one being there, I dragged him out 
of the stable myself, strapped the saddle on to his back and the bridle 
on to his head, mounted, and speedily galloped away to Woodford. I 
found its owner pensively strolling in the grounds. 
</p>
               <p>`Is your sister gone?' were my first words as I grasped his hand, 
instead of the usual enquiry after his health. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; she's gone,' was his answer, so calmly spoken, that my terror was 
at once removed. 
</p>
               <p>`I suppose I mayn't know where she is?' said I, as I did mounted and 
relinquished my horse to the gardener, who, being the only servant 
within call, had been summoned by his master, from his employment of 
raking up the dead leaves on the lawn, to take him to the stables. 
</p>
               <p>My companion gravely took my arm, and leading me away to the garden, 
thus answered my question:— 
</p>
               <p>`She is at Grassdale Manor, in —hire.' 
</p>
               <p>`Where?' cried I, with a convulsive start. 
</p>
               <p>`At Grassdale Manor.' 
</p>
               <p>`How was it?' I gasped. `Who betrayed her?' 
</p>
               <p>`She went of her own accord.' 
</p>
               <p>`Impossible, Lawrence!! She <hi>could</hi> not be so frantic!' exclaimed 
I, vehemently grasping his arm, as if to force him to unsay those 
hateful words. 
</p>
               <p>`She did,' persisted he in the same grave, collected manner as before 
`and not without reason,' he continued, gently disengaging himself from 
my grasp: `Mr. Huntingdon is ill.' 
</p>
               <p>`And so she went to nurse him?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes.' 
</p>
               <p>`Fool!' I could not help exclaiming—and Lawrence looked up with a 
rather reproachful glance. `Is he dying then?' 
</p>
               <p>`I think not, Markham.' 
</p>
               <p>`And how many more nurses has he?—How many ladies are there besides, 
to take care of him?' 
</p>
               <p>`None: he was alone, or she would not have gone.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, confound it! this is intolerable!' 
</p>
               <p>`What is? That he should be alone?' 
</p>
               <p>I attempted no reply, for I was not sure that this circumstance did not 
partly conduce to my distraction. I therefore continued to pace the 
walk in silent anguish, with my hand pressed to my forehead; then 
suddenly pausing and turning to my companion, I impatiently 
exclaimed, 
</p>
               <p>`Why did she take this infatuated step? What fiend persuaded her to 
it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Nothing persuaded her but her own sense of duty.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humbug!' 
</p>
               <p>`I was half inclined to say so myself, Markham, at first. I assure you 
it was not by my advice that she went, for I detest that man as 
fervently as you can do—except, indeed, that his reformation would 
give me much greater pleasure than his death:—But all I did was to 
inform her of the circumstance of his illness (the consequence of a 
fall from his horse in hunting), and to tell her that that unhappy 
person, Miss Myers, had left him some time ago. 
</p>
               <p>`It was ill done! Now, when he finds the convenience of her presence, 
he will make all manner of lying speeches and false, fair promises for 
the future, and she will believe him, and then her condition will be 
ten times worse and ten times more irremediable than before.' 
</p>
               <p>`There does not appear to be much ground for such apprehensions at 
present,' said he, producing a letter from his pocket: `from the 
account I received this morning, I should say—' 
</p>
               <p>It was <hi>her</hi> writing! By an irresistible impulse, I held out my 
hand, and the words— `Let me see it,' involuntarily passed my lips. 
He was evidently reluctant to grant the request, but while he 
hesitated, I snatched it from his hand. Recollecting myself, however, 
the minute after, I offered to restore it. 
</p>
               <p>`Here, take it,' said I, `if you don't want me to read it.' 
</p>
               <p>`No,' replied he, `you may read it if you like.' 
</p>
               <p>I read it and so may you. 
</p>
               <p>Grassdale, Nov. 4th. 
</p>
               <p>Dear Frederick, 
</p>
               <p>I know you will be anxious to hear from me: and I will tell you all I 
can. Mr. Huntingdon is very ill, but not dying, or in any immediate 
danger; and he is rather better at present than he was when I came. I 
found the house in sad confusion: Mrs. Greaves, Benson, every decent 
servant had left, and those that were come to supply their places were 
a negligent, disorderly set, to say no worse—I must change them again 
if I stay. A professional nurse, a grim, hard old woman, had been hired 
to attend the wretched invalid. He suffers much, and has no fortitude 
to bear him through. The immediate injuries he sustained from the 
accident, however, were not very severe, and would, as the doctor says, 
have been but trifling to a man of temperate habits; but with 
<hi>him</hi> it is very different. On the night of my arrival, when I 
first entered his room, he was lying in a kind of half delirium. He did 
not notice me till I spoke; and then, he mistook me for another. 
</p>
               <p>`Is it you, Alice, come again?' he murmured. `What did you leave me 
for?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is I, Arthur—it is Helen, your wife,' i replied. 
</p>
               <p>`My wife!' said he, with a start.— `For Heaven's sake, don't mention 
her—I have none.devil take her,' he cried, a moment after,— `and you 
too! What did you do it for?' 
</p>
               <p>I said no more; but observing that he kept gazing towards the foot of 
the bed, I went and sat there, placing the light so as to shine full 
upon me; for I thought he might be dying, and I wanted him to know me. 
For a long time, he lay silently looking upon me, first with a vacant 
stare, then with a fixed gaze of strange, growing intensity. At last 
he startled me by suddenly raising himself on his elbow and demanding 
in a horrified whisper, with his eyes still fixed upon me,— `Who is 
it?' 
</p>
               <p>`It is Helen Huntingdon,' said I, quietly, rising, at the same time, 
and removing to a less conspicuous position. 
</p>
               <p>`I must be going mad,' cried he—`or something—delirious perhaps—But 
leave me, whoever you are—I can't bear that white face, and those 
eyes—for God's sake go, and send me somebody else, that doesn't look 
like that!' 
</p>
               <p>I went, at once, and sent the hired nurse. But next morning, I ventured 
to enter his chamber again; and, taking the nurse's place by his 
bed-side, I watched him and waited on him for several hours, showing 
myself as little as possible, and only speaking when necessary, and 
then not above my breath. At first he addressed me us the nurse, but, 
on my crossing the room to draw up the window-blinds, in obedience to 
his directions, he said— 
</p>
               <p>`No, it isn't nurse; it's Alice. Stay with me do! that old hag will be 
the death of me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I mean to stay with you,' said I. And after that, he would call me 
Alice—or some other name almost equally repugnant to my feelings. I 
forced myself to endure it for a while, fearing a contradiction might 
disturb him too much: but when, having asked for a glass of water, 
while I held it to his lips, he murmured `Thanks, dearest!'—I could 
not help distinctly observing—`You would not say so if you knew me,' 
intending to follow that up with another declaration of my identity, 
but he merely muttered an incoherent reply, so I dropped it again, till 
some time after, when, as I was bathing his forehead and temples with 
vinegar and water to relieve the heat and pain in his head, he 
observed, after looking earnestly upon me for some minutes— 
</p>
               <p>`I have such strange fancies—I can't get rid of them, and they won't 
let me rest; and the most singular and pertinacious of them all, is 
your face and voice; they seem just like hers. I could swear at this 
moment, that she was by my side.' 
</p>
               <p>`She is,' said I. 
</p>
               <p>`That seems comfortable,' continued he, without noticing my words; `and 
while you do it, the other fancies fade away—but <hi>this</hi> only 
strengthens. Go onto on, till it vanishes too. I can't stand such a 
mania as this; it would kill me!' 
</p>
               <p>`It never will vanish,' said I distinctly, `for it is the truth.' 
</p>
               <p>`The truth!' he cried, starting as if an asp had stung him. `You don't 
mean to say that you are really she!' 
</p>
               <p>`I do; but you needn't shrink away from me, as if I were your greatest 
enemy: I am come to take care of you, and do what none of <hi>them</hi>
would do.' 
</p>
               <p>`For God's sake, don't torment me now!' cried he in pitiable agitation; 
and then he began to mutter bitter curses against me, or the evil 
fortune that had brought me there; while I put down the sponge and 
basin, and resumed my seat at the bedside. 
</p>
               <p>`Where are they?' said he `have they all left me—servants and all?' 
</p>
               <p>`There are servants within call, if you want them; but you had better 
lie down now and be quiet: none of them could or would attend you as 
carefully as I shall do.' 
</p>
               <p>`I can't understand it at all,' said he, in bewildered perplexity. `Was 
it a dream that `and he covered his eyes with his hand, as if trying 
to unravel the mystery. 
</p>
               <p>`No Arthur, it was not a dream, that your conduct was such as to oblige 
me to leave you; but I heard that you were ill and alone, and I am come 
back to nurse you. You need not fear to trust me: tell me all your 
wants, and I will try to satisfy them. There is no one else to care for 
you; and I shall not upbraid you now. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh! I see,' said he with a bitter smile, `it's an act of Christian 
charity, whereby you hope to gain a higher seat in Heaven for yourself, 
and scoop a deeper pit in hell for me.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; I came to offer you that comfort and assistance your situation 
required; and if I could benefit your soul as well as your body, and 
awaken some sense of contrition and—' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, yes; if you could overwhelm me with remorse and confusion of 
face,' now's the time. What have you done with my son?' 
</p>
               <p>`He is well, and you may see him some time, if you will compose 
yourself, but not now. 
</p>
               <p>`Where is he?' 
</p>
               <p>`He is safe.' 
</p>
               <p>`Is he here?' 
</p>
               <p>`Wherever he is, you will not see him till you have promised to leave 
him entirely under my care and protection, and to let me take him away 
whenever and wherever I please, if I should hereafter judge it 
necessary to remove him again. But we will talk of that to-morrow: you 
must be quiet now.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, let me see him now. I promise, if it <hi>must</hi> be so. 
</p>
               <p>`No—' 
</p>
               <p>`I swear it, as God is in Heaven! Now then, let me see him.' 
</p>
               <p>`But I cannot trust your oaths and promises: I must have a written 
agreement, and you must sign it in presence of a witness—But not 
to-day, to-morrow. 
</p>
               <p>`No, to-day—now,' persisted he: and he was in such a state of feverish 
excitement, and so bent upon the immediate gratification of his wish, 
that I thought it better to grant it at once, as I saw he would not 
rest till I did. But I was determined my son's interest should not be 
forgotten; and having clearly written out the promise I wished Mr. 
Huntingdon to give upon a slip of paper, I deliberately read it over 
to him, and made him sign it in the presence of Rachel. He begged I 
would not insist upon this: it was a useless exposure of my want of 
faith in his word, to the servant. I told him I was sorry, but since 
he had forfeited my confidence, he must take the consequence. He next 
pleaded inability to hold the pen. `Then we must wait until you can 
hold it,' said I. Upon which, he said he would try; but then, he could 
not see to write. I placed my finger where the signature was to be, and 
told him he might write his name in the dark, if he only knew where to 
put it. But he had not power to form the letters. `In that case, you 
must be too ill to see the child,' said I; and finding me inexorable, 
he at length managed to ratify the agreement; and I bade Rachel send 
the boy. 
</p>
               <p>All this may strike you as harsh, but I felt I must not lose my present 
advantage, and my son's future welfare should not be sacrificed to any 
mistaken tenderness for this man's feelings. Little Arthur had not 
forgotten his father, but thirteen months of absence, during which he 
had seldom been permitted to hear a word about him, or hardly to 
whisper his name, had rendered him somewhat shy; and when he was 
ushered into the darkened room where the sick man lay, so altered from 
his former self, with fiercely flushed face and wildly gleaming 
eyes—he instinctively clung to me, and stood looking on his father 
with a countenance expressive of far more awe than pleasure. 
</p>
               <p>`Come here, Arthur,' said the latter, extending his hand towards him. 
The child went, and timidly touched that burning hand, but almost 
started in alarm, when his father suddenly clutched his arm and drew 
him nearer to his side. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you know me?' asked Mr. Huntingdon, intently perusing his 
features. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes.' 
</p>
               <p>`Who am I?' 
</p>
               <p>`Papa.' 
</p>
               <p>`Are you glad to see me?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes.' 
</p>
               <p>`You're <hi>not</hi>!' replied the disappointed parent, relaxing his 
hold, and darting a vindictive glance at me. 
</p>
               <p>Arthur, thus released, crept back to me and put his hand in mine. His 
father swore I had made the child hate him, and abused and cursed me 
bitterly. The instant he began I sent our son out of the room; and when 
he paused to breathe, I calmly assured him that he was entirely 
mistaken; I had never once attempted to prejudice his child against 
him. 
</p>
               <p>`I did indeed desire him to <hi>forget</hi> you,' I said, `and especially 
to forget the lessons you taught him; and for that cause, and to lessen 
the danger of discovery, I own I have generally discouraged his 
inclination to talk about you;—But no one can blame me for that, I 
think.' 
</p>
               <p>The invalid only replied by groaning aloud and rolling his head on a 
pillow in a paroxysm of impatience. 
</p>
               <p>`I am in hell, already!' cried he. `This cursed thirst is burning my 
heart to ashes! Will <hi>nobody</hi>—' 
</p>
               <p>Before he could finish the sentence, I had poured out a glass of some 
acidulated, cooling drink that was on the table, and brought it to him. 
He drank it greedily, but muttered, as I took away the glass,— 
</p>
               <p>`I suppose you're heaping coals of fire on my head—you think.' 
</p>
               <p>Not noticing this speech, I asked if there was anything else I could 
do for him. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes; I'll give you another opportunity of shewing your Christian 
magnanimity,' sneered he:—`set my pillow straight,—and these 
confounded bed-clothes.' I did so. `There—now, get me another glass 
of that slop.' I complied. `This is delightful! isn't it?' said he with 
a malicious grin, as I held it to his lips—you never hoped for such 
a glorious opportunity?' 
</p>
               <p>`Now, shall I stay with you?' said I, as I replaced the glass on the 
table— `or will you be more quiet if I go, and send the nurse?' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, yes, you're wondrous gentle and obliging—But you've driven me mad 
with it all!' responded he, with an impatient toss. 
</p>
               <p>`I'll leave you then,' said I, and I withdrew, and did not trouble him 
with my presence again that day, except for a minute or two at a time, 
just to see how he was and what he wanted. 
</p>
               <p>Next morning, the doctor ordered him to be bled; and after that, he was 
more subdued and tranquil. I passed half the day in his room at 
different intervals. My presence did not appear to agitate or irritate 
him as before, and he accepted my services quietly, without any bitter 
remarks—indeed he scarcely spoke at all, except to make known his 
wants, and hardly then. But on the morrow—that is, to-day—in 
proportion as he recovered from the state of exhaustion and 
stupefaction—his ill-nature appeared to revive. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, this sweet revenge!' cried he, when I had been doing all I could 
to make him comfortable and to remedy the carelessness of his nurse. 
`And you can enjoy it with such a quiet conscience too, because it's 
all in the way of duty.' 
</p>
               <p>`It is well for me that I <hi>am</hi> doing my duty,' said I, with a 
bitterness I could not repress, `for it is the only comfort I have; and 
the satisfaction of my own conscience, it seems, is the only reward I 
need look for!' 
</p>
               <p>He looked rather surprised at the earnestness of my manner. `What 
reward <hi>did</hi> you look for?' he asked. 
</p>
               <p>`You will think me a liar if I tell you—But I <hi>did</hi> hope to 
benefit you: as well to better your mind, as to alleviate your present 
sufferings; but it appears I am to do neither—your own bad spirit will 
not let me. As far as <hi>you</hi> are concerned, I have sacrificed my 
own feelings, and all the little earthly comfort that was left me, to 
no purpose;—and every little thing I do for you is ascribed to 
self-righteous malice and refined revenge!' 
</p>
               <p>`It's all very fine, I dare say,' said he, eyeing me with stupid 
amazement; `and of course I ought to be melted to tears of penitence 
and admiration at the sight of so much generosity and superhuman 
goodness,—But you see I can't man.age it. However, pray do me all the 
good you can, if you do really find any pleasure in it; for you 
perceive I am almost as miserable just now as you need wish to see me. 
Since you came, I confess, I have had better attendance than before, 
for these wretches neglected me shamefully, and all my old friends seem 
to have fairly forsaken me. I've had a dreadful time of it, I assure 
you: I sometimes thought I should have died—do you think there's any 
chance?' 
</p>
               <p>`There's always a chance of death; and it is always well to live with 
such a chance in view.' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, yes—But do you think there's any likelihood that this illness 
will have a fatal termination?' 
</p>
               <p>`I cannot tell; but, supposing it should, how are you prepared to meet 
the event?' 
</p>
               <p>`Why, the doctor told me I wasn't to think about it, for I was sure to 
get better, if I stuck to his regimen and prescriptions.' 
</p>
               <p>`I hope you may, Arthur, but neither the doctor nor I can speak with 
certainty in such a case: there is internal injury, and it is difficult 
to know to what extent.' 
</p>
               <p>`There now! you want to scare me to death.' 
</p>
               <p>`No; but I don't want to lull you to false security. If a consciousness 
of the uncertainty of life can dispose you to serious and useful 
thoughts, I would not deprive you of the benefit of such reflections, 
whether you do eventually recover or not. Does the idea of death appal 
you <hi>very</hi> much?' 
</p>
               <p>`It's just the only thing I can't bear to think of; so if you've 
any—' 
</p>
               <p>`But it must come sometime,' interrupted I; `and if it be years hence, 
it will as certainly overtake you as if it came to-day,—and no doubt 
be as unwelcome then as now, unless you—' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, hang it! don't torment me with your preachments now, unless you 
want to kill me outright—I can't stand it, I tell you—I've sufferings 
enough without that. If you think there's danger, save me from it; and 
then, in gratitude, I'll hear whatever you like to say.' 
</p>
               <p>I accordingly dropped the unwelcome topic. And now, Frederick, I think 
I may bring my letter to a close. From these details, you may form your 
own judgment of the state of my patient, and of my own position and 
future prospects. Let me hear from you soon, and I will write again to 
tell you how we get on; but now that my presence is tolerated—and even 
required in the sick-room, I shall have but little time to spare 
between my husband and my son,—for I must not entirely neglect the 
latter: it would not do to keep him always with Rachel, and I dare not 
leave him for a moment with any of the other servants, or suffer him 
to be alone, lest he should meet them. If his father get worse, I shall 
ask Esther Hargrave to take charge of him for a time, till I have 
re-organized the household at least; but I greatly prefer keeping him 
under my own eye. 
</p>
               <p>I find myself in rather a singular position: I am exerting my utmost 
endeavours to promote the recovery and reformation of my husband, and 
if I succeed what shall I do? My duty, of course,—But how?—No matter; 
I can perform the task that is before me now, and God will give me 
strength to do whatever He requires hereafter.food bye, dear 
Frederick. 
</p>
               <p>Helen Huntingdon. 
</p>
               <p>`What do you think of it?' said Lawrence as I silently refolded the 
letter. 
</p>
               <p>`It seems to me,' returned I, `that she is casting her pearls before 
swine. May they be satisfied with trampling them under their feet, and 
not turn again and rend her!' But I shall say no more against her: I 
see that she was actuated by the best and noblest motives in what she 
has done; and if the act is not a wise one, may Heaven protect her from 
its consequences! May I keep this letter, Lawrence?—you see she has 
never once mentioned me throughout—or made the most distant allusion 
to me; therefore, there can be no impropriety or harm in it.' 
</p>
               <p>`And therefore, why should you wish to keep it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Were not these characters written by her hand? and were not these 
words conceived in her mind, and many of them spoken by her lips?' 
</p>
               <p>`Well,' said he. And so I kept it; otherwise, Halford, you could never 
have become 50 thoroughly acquainted with its contents. 
</p>
               <p>`And when you write,' said I, `will you have the goodness to ask her 
if I may be permitted to enlighten my mother and sister on her real 
history and circumstance, just so far as is necessary to make the 
neighbourhood sensible of the shameful injustice they have done her? 
I want no tender messages, but just ask her that, and tell her it is 
the greatest favour she could do me; and tell her—no, nothing 
more.—You see I know the address, and I might write to her myself, but 
I am so virtuous as to refrain.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, I'll do this for you, Markham.' 
</p>
               <p>`And as soon as you receive an answer, you'll let me know?' 
</p>
               <p>`If all be well, I'll come myself and tell you, immediately.'

               <head>CHAPTER XLVIII</head>
               <head>FURTHER INTELLIGENCE</head>
               <p>Five or six days after this, Mr. Lawrence paid us the honour of a call; 
and when he and I were alone together—which I contrived as soon as 
possible, by bringing him out to look at my cornstacks—he showed me 
another letter from his sister. This one he was quite willing to submit 
to my longing gaze: he thought, I suppose, it would do me good. The 
only answer it gave to my message was this: 
</p>
               <p>`Mr. Markham is at liberty to make such revelations concerning me as 
he judges necessary. He will know that I should wish but little to be 
said on the subject. I hope he is well; but tell him he must not think 
of me.' 
</p>
               <p>I can give you a few extracts from the rest of the letter, for I was 
permitted to keep this also—perhaps, as an antidote to all pernicious 
hopes and fancies. 
</p>
               <p>——————— 
</p>
               <p>He is decidedly better, but very low from the depressing effects of his 
severe illness and the strict regimen he is obliged to observe—so 
opposite to all his previous habits. It is deplorable to see how 
completely his past life has degenerated his once noble constitution, 
and vitiated the whole system of his organization. But the doctor says 
he may now be considered out of danger, if he will only continue to 
observe the necessary restrictions. Some stimulating cordials he must 
have, but they should be judiciously diluted and sparingly used; and 
I find it very difficult to keep him to this. At first, his extreme 
dread of death rendered the task an easy one; but in proportion as he 
feels his acute suffering abating and sees the danger receding, the 
more intractable he becomes. Now also, his appetite for food is 
beginning to return; and here too, his long habits of self-indulgence 
are greatly against him. I watch and restrain him as well as I can, and 
often get bitterly abused for my rigid severity; and sometimes he 
contrives to illude my vigilance, and sometimes acts in open opposition 
to my will. But he is now so completely reconciled to my attendance in 
general that he is never satisfied when I am not by his side. I am 
obliged to be a little stiff with him sometimes, or he would make a 
complete slave of me; and I know it would be unpardonable weakness to 
give up all other interests for him. I have the servants to overlook 
and my little Arthur to attend to,—and my own health too, all of which 
would be entirely neglected were I to satisfy his exorbitant demands. 
I do not generally sit up at nights, for I think the nurse who has made 
it her business, is better qualified for such undertakings than I am; 
but still, an unbroken night's rest is what I but seldom enjoy, and 
never can venture to reckon upon; for my patient makes no scruple of 
calling me up at any hour when his wants or his fancies require my 
presence. But he is manifestly afraid of my displeasure; and if at one 
time he tries my patience by his unreasonable exactions, and fretful 
complaints and reproaches, at another, he depresses me by his abject 
submission and deprecatory self-abasement when he fears he has gone too 
far. But all this I can readily pardon; I know it is chiefly the result 
of his enfeebled frame and disordered nerves—what annoys me the most, 
is his occasional attempts at affectionate fondness that I can neither 
credit nor return; not that I hate him: his sufferings and my own 
laborious care have given him some claim to my regard—to my affection 
even, if he would only be quiet and sincere, and content to let things 
remain as they are, but the more he tries to conciliate me the more I 
shrink from him and from the future. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, what do you mean to do when I get well?' he asked this morning. 
`Will you run away again?' 
</p>
               <p>`It entirely depends upon your own conduct.' 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, I'll be very good.' 
</p>
               <p>`But if I find it necessary to leave you, Arthur, I shall not “run 
away:” you know I have your own promise that I may go whenever I 
please, and take my son with me. 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, but you shall have no cause.' And then followed a variety of 
professions, which I rather coldly checked. 
</p>
               <p>`Will you not forgive me then?' said he. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes,—I <hi>have</hi> forgiven you; but I know you cannot love me as you 
once did—and I should be very sorry if you were to, for I could not 
pretend to return it: so let us drop the subject, and never recur to 
it again. By what I <hi>have</hi> done for you, you may judge of what I 
<hi>will</hi> do—if it be not incompatible with the higher duty I owe 
to my son (higher, because he never forfeited his claims, and because 
I hope to do more good to him than I can ever do to you); and if you 
wish me to feel kindly towards you, it is <hi>deeds</hi> not <hi>words</hi>
that must purchase my affection and esteem. 
</p>
               <p>His sole reply to this was a slight grimace, and a scarcely perceptible 
shrug. Alas unhappy man! words, with him, are so much cheaper than 
deeds; it was as if I had said, `Pounds, not pence, must buy the 
article you want.' And then he sighed a querulous, self-commiserating 
sigh, as if in pure regret that he, the loved and courted of so many 
worshippers, should be now abandoned to the mercy of a harsh, exacting, 
cold-hearted woman like that, and even glad of what kindness she chose 
to bestow. 
</p>
               <p>`It's a pity, isn't it?' said I; and whether I rightly divined his 
musings or not, the observation chimed in with his thoughts, for he 
answered— `It can't be helped,' with a rueful smile at my 
penetration. 
</p>
               <p>——————- 
</p>
               <p>I have seen Esther Hargrave twice. She is a charming creature, but her 
blithe spirit is almost broken, and her sweet temper almost spoiled, 
by the still unremitting persecutions of her mother, in behalf of her 
rejected suitor—not violent, but wearisome and unremitting like a 
continual dropping. The unnatural parent seems determined to make her 
daughter's life a burden if she will not yield to her desires. 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma does all she can,' said she, `to make me feel myself a burden 
and incumbrance to the family, and the most ungrateful, selfish, and 
undutiful daughter that ever was born; and Walter, too, is as stern and 
cold, and haughty as if he hated me outright. I believe I should have 
yielded at once if I had known, from the beginning, how much resistance 
would have cost me; but now, for very obstinacy's sake, I <hi>will</hi>
stand out!' 
</p>
               <p>`A bad motive for a good resolve,' I answered. `But however, I know you 
have better motives, really, for your perseverance: and I counsel you 
to keep them still in view.' 
</p>
               <p>`Trust me, I will. I threaten mamma sometimes, that I'll run away, and 
disgrace the family by earning my own livelihood, if she torments me 
any more; and then that frightens her a little. But I <hi>will</hi> do 
it, in good earnest, if they don't mind.' 
</p>
               <p>`Be quiet and patient awhile,' said I, `and better times will come.' 
</p>
               <p>Poor girl! I wish somebody that was worthy to possess her would come 
and take her away—don't you, Frederick? 
</p>
               <p>——————- 
</p>
               <p>If the perusal of this letter filled me with dismay for Helen's future 
life and mine, there was one great source of consolation: it was now 
in my power to clear her name from every foul aspersion. The Millwards 
and the Wilsons should see with their own eyes, the bright sun bursting 
from the cloud—and they should be scorched and dazzled by its 
beams;—and my own friends too should see it—they whose suspicions had 
been such gall and wormwood' to my soul. To effect this, I had only to 
drop the seed into the ground, and it would soon become a stately, 
branching herb: a few words to my mother and sister, I knew, would 
suffice to spread the news throughout the whole neighbourhood, without 
any further exertion on my part. 
</p>
               <p>Rose was delighted; and as soon as I had told her all I thought 
proper—which was all I affected to know—she flew with alacrity to put 
on her bonnet and shawl, and hasten to carry the glad tidings to the 
Millwards and Wilsons—glad tidings I suspect, to none but herself and 
Mary Millward—what steady, sensible girl, whose sterling worth had 
been so quickly perceived and duly valued by the supposed Mrs. Graham, 
in spite of her plain outside; and who, on her part, had been better 
able to see and appreciate that lady's true character and qualities 
than the brightest genius among them. 
</p>
               <p>As I may never have occasion to mention her again, I may as well tell 
you here, that she was at this time privately engaged to Richard 
Wilson—secret, I believe to every one but their two selves. That 
worthy student was now at Cambridge, where his most exemplary conduct 
and his diligent perseverance in the pursuit of learning carried him 
safely through, and eventually brought him with hard-earned honours and 
an untarnished reputation, to the close of his collegiate career. In 
due time, he became Mr. Millward's first and only curate—for that 
gentleman's declining years forced him at last to acknowledge that the 
duties of his extensive parish were a little too much for those vaunted 
energies which he was wont to boast over his younger and less active 
brethren of the cloth. This was what the patient, faithful lovers had 
privately planned, and quietly waited for years ago; and in due time 
they were united, to the astonishment of the little world they lived 
in, that had long since declared them both born to single bIessedness; 
affirming it impossible that the pale, retiring bookworm should ever 
summon courage to seek a wife, or be able to obtain one if he did, and 
equally impossible that the plain-looking, plain-dealing, unattractive, 
unconciliating Miss Millward should ever find a husband. 
</p>
               <p>They still continued to live at the vicarage, the lady dividing her 
time between her father, her husband, and their poor parishioners,—and 
subsequently, her rising family; and now that the Reverend Michael 
Millward has been gathered to his fathers, full of years and honours,' 
the Reverend Richard Wilson has succeeded him to the vicarage of 
Lindenhope, greatly to the satisfaction of its inhabitants, who had so 
long tried and fully proved his merits, and those of his excellent and 
well-loved partner. 
</p>
               <p>If you are interested in the after fate of that lady's sister, I can 
only tell you—what perhaps you have heard from another quarter—that 
some twelve or thirteen years ago, she relieved the happy couple of her 
presence by marrying a wealthy tradesman of L ; and I don't envy him 
his bargain. I fear she leads him a rather uncomfortable life, though, 
happily he is too dull to perceive the extent of his misfortune. I have 
little enough to do with her myself: we have not met for many years; 
but, I am well assured, she has not yet forgotten or forgiven either 
her former lover or the lady whose superior qualities first opened his 
eyes to the folly of his boyish attachment. 
</p>
               <p>As for Richard Wilson's sister, she, having been wholly unable to 
re-capture Mr. Lawrence or obtain any partner rich and elegant enough 
to suit her ideas of what the husband of Jane Wilson ought to be, is 
yet in single blessedness. Shortly after the death of her mother, she 
withdrew the light of her presence from Ryecote Farm, finding it 
impossible any longer to endure the rough manners and unsophisticated 
habits of her honest brother Robert and his worthy wife, or the idea 
of being identified with such vulgar people in the eyes of the 
world,—and took lodgings in the county town, where she lived, and 
still lives, I suppose, in a kind of closefisted, cold, uncomfortable 
gentility, doing no good to others and but little to herself; spending 
her days in fancy-work and scandal; referring frequently to her 
`brother the vicar' and her `sister the vicar's lady,' but never to her 
brother the farmer and her sister the farmer's wife; seeing as much 
company as she can without too much expense, but loving no one and 
beloved by none—a cold-hearted, supercilious, keenly, insidiously 
censorious old maid.

               <q>
                  <p>“The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and best 
upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.” 
</p>
               </q>
               <p>Though Mr. Lawrence's health was now quite re-established, my visits 
to Woodford were as unremitting as ever; though often less protracted 
than before. We seldom <hi>talked</hi> about Mrs. Huntingdon; but yet we 
never met without mentioning her, for I never sought his company but 
with the hope of hearing something about her, and he never sought mine 
at all, because he saw me often enough without. But I always began to 
talk of other things, and waited first to see if <hi>he</hi> would 
introduce the subject. If he did not, I would casually ask, `Have you 
heard from your sister lately?' If he said, `No,' the matter was 
dropped: if he said `Yes,' I would venture to enquire, `How is she?' 
but never `How is her husband?' though I might be burning to know; 
because, I had not the hypocrisy to profess any anxiety for his 
recovery, and I had not the face to express any desire for a contrary 
result. Had I any such desire?I fear I must plead guilty: but since you 
have heard my confession, you must hear my justification as wells few 
of the excuses, at least, wherewith I sought to pacify my own accusing 
conscience: 
</p>
               <p>In the first place, you see, his life did harm to others, and evidently 
no good to himself, and though I wished it to terminate, I would not 
have hastened its close if, by the lifting of a finger, I could have 
done so, or if a spirit had whispered in my ear that a single effort 
of the will would be enough,—unless, indeed, I had the power to 
exchange him for some other victim of the grave, whose life might be 
of service to his race, and whose death would be lamented by his 
friends. But was there any harm in wishing that, among the many 
thousands whose souls would certainly be required of them before the 
year was over, this wretched mortal might be one? I thought not; and 
therefore I wished with all my heart that it might please Heaven to 
remove him to a better world, or if that might not be, still, to take 
him out of this, for if he were unfit to answer the summons now, after 
a warning sickness, and with such an angel by his side, it seemed but 
too certain that he never would be—that, on the contrary, returning 
health would bring returning lust and villany, and as he grew more 
certain of recovery, more accustomed to her generous goodness, his 
feelings would become more callous, his heart more flinty and 
impervious to her persuasive arguments—But God knew best. Meantime, 
however, I could not but be anxious for the result of His decrees; 
knowing, as I did, that (leaving myself entirely out of the question) 
however Helen might feel interested in her husband's welfare, however 
she might deplore his fate, still, while he lived, she <hi>must</hi> be 
miserable. 
</p>
               <p>A fortnight passed away, and my enquiries were always answered in the 
negative. At length a welcome `yes' drew from me the second question. 
Lawrence divined my anxious thoughts, and appreciated my reserve. I 
feared at first, he was going to torture me by unsatisfactory replies, 
and either leave me quite in the dark concerning what I wanted to know, 
or force me to drag the information out of him, morsel by morsel, by 
direct inquiries—and serve you right,' you will say; but he was more 
merciful; and in a little while, he put his sister's letter into my 
hand. I silently read it, and restored it to him without comment or 
remark. This mode of procedure suited him so well that thereafter he 
always pursued the plan of showing me her letters at once, when I 
enquired after her, if there were any to show: it was so much less 
trouble than to tell me their contents; and I received such confidences 
so quietly and discreetly that he was never induced to discontinue 
them. 
</p>
               <p>But I devoured those precious letters with my eyes, and never let them 
go till their contents were stamped upon my mind; and when I got home, 
the most important passages were entered in my diary among the 
remarkable events of the day. 
</p>
               <p>The first of these communications brought intelligence of a serious 
relapse in Mr. Huntingdon's illness, entirely the result of his own 
infatuation in persisting in the indulgence of his appetite for 
stimulating drink. In vain had she remonstrated, in vain she had 
mingled his wine with water: her arguments and entreaties were a 
nuisance, her interference was an insult so intolerable that at length, 
on finding she had covertly diluted the pale port that was brought him, 
he threw the bottle out of the window, swearing he would not be cheated 
like a baby, ordered the butler, on pain of instant dismissal, to bring 
a bottle of the strongest wine in the cellar, and, affirming that he 
should have been well long ago if he had been let to have his own way, 
but she wanted to keep him weak in order that she might have him under 
her thumb—But by the Lord Harry, he would have no more humbug—seized 
a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other, and never rested till 
he had drunk it dry. Alarming symptoms were the immediate result of 
this `imprudence' as she mildly termed it—symptoms which had rather 
increased than diminished since; and this was the cause of her delay 
in writing to her brother. Every former feature of his malady had 
returned with augmented virulence: the slight external wound, 
half-healed, had broken out afresh; internal inflammation had taken 
place, which might terminate fatally if not soon removed. Of course, 
the wretched sufferer's temper was not improved by this calamity—in 
fact, I suspect it was well nigh insupportable, though his kind nurse 
did not complain; but she said she had been obliged, at last, to give 
her son in charge to Esther Hargrave, as her presence was so constantly 
required in the sick room that she could not possibly attend to him 
herself, and though the child had begged to be allowed to continue with 
her there, and to help her to nurse his papa, and though she had no 
doubt he would have been very good and quiet, she could not think of 
subjecting his young and tender feelings to the sight of so much 
suffering, or of allowing him to witness his father's impatience, or 
hear the dreadful language he was wont to use in his paroxysms of pain 
or irritation. 
</p>
               <p>`The latter,' continued she, `most deeply regrets the step that has 
occasioned his relapse,—But, as usual, he throws the blame upon me. 
If I had reasoned with him like a rational creature, he says, it never 
would have happened; but to be treated like a baby or a fool, was 
enough to put any man past his patience, and drive him to assert his 
independence even at the sacrifice of his own interest—he forgets how 
often I had <hi>reasoned</hi> him “past his patience” before. He appears 
to be sensible of his danger; but nothing can induce him to behold it 
in the  proper light. The other night while I was waiting on him, and 
just as I had brought him a draught to assuage his burning thirst—he 
observed, with a return of his former sarcastic bitterness,— 
</p>
               <p>`”Yes, you're mighty attentive <hi>now</hi>!—I suppose there's 
<hi>nothing</hi> you wouldn't do for me now?' 
</p>
               <p>“You know,” said I, a little surprised at his manner, “that I am 
willing to do anything I can to relieve you.” 
</p>
               <p>`”Yes, <hi>no</hi>”', my immaculate angel; but when once you have secured 
your reward, and find yourself safe in Heaven, and me howling in 
hell-fire, catch you lifting a finger to serve me <hi>then</hi>!—No, 
you'll look complacently on, and not so much as dip the tip of your 
finger in water to cool my tongue!”' 
</p>
               <p>`”If so, it will be because of the great gulf over which I cannot pass; 
and if I <hi>could</hi> look complacently on in such a case, it would be 
only from the assurance that you were being purified from your sins, 
and fitted to enjoy the happiness I felt.hut are you <hi>determined</hi>, 
Arthur, that I shall not meet you in Heaven?” 
</p>
               <p>`”Humph! What should I do there, I should like to know?” 
</p>
               <p>`”Indeed, I cannot tell; and I fear it is too certain that your tastes 
and feelings must be widely altered before you can have any enjoyment 
there. But do you prefer sinking, without an effort, into the state of 
torment you picture to yourself?” 
</p>
               <p>“Oh, it's all a fable,” said he, contemptuously. 
</p>
               <p>`”Are you sure, Arthur? are you <hi>quite</hi> sure? Because if there is 
any doubt, and if you <hi>should</hi> find yourself mistaken after all, 
when it is too late to turn—” 
</p>
               <p>`”It would be rather awkward, to be sure,” said he; “but don't bother 
me now—I'm not going to die yet.—I can't and won't,” he added 
vehemently, as if suddenly struck with the appalling aspect of that 
terrible event, “Helen, you <hi>must</hi> save me!” And he earnestly 
seized my hand, and looked into my face with such imploring eagerness 
that my heart bled for him, and I could not speak for tears.' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p/>
               <p>The next letter brought intelligence that the malady was fast 
increasing; and the poor sufferer's horror of death was still more 
distressing than his impatience of bodily pain. <hi>All</hi> his friends 
had not forsaken him, for Mr. Hattersley, hearing of his danger, had 
come to see him from his distant home in the north. His wife had 
accompanied him, as much for the pleasure of seeing her dear friend, 
from whom she had been parted so long, as to visit her mother and 
sister. 
</p>
               <p>Mrs. Huntingdon expressed herself glad to see Milicent once more, and 
pleased to behold her so happy and well. `She is now at the Grove,' 
continued the letter, `but she often calls to see me. Mr. Hattersley 
spends much of his time at Arthur's bedside. With more good feeling 
than I gave him credit for, he evinces considerable sympathy for his 
unhappy friend, and is far more willing than able to comfort him. 
Sometimes he tries to joke and laugh with him, but that will not do: 
sometimes he endeavours to cheer him with talk about old times; and 
this, at one time, may serve to divert the sufferer from his own sad 
thoughts; at another, it will only plunge him into deeper melancholy 
than before; and then Hattersley is confounded, and knows not what to 
say,—unless it be a timid suggestion that the clergyman might be sent 
for. But Arthur will never consent to that: he knows he has rejected 
the clergyman's well-meant admonitions with scoffing levity at other 
times, and cannot dream of turning to him for consolation now. 
</p>
               <p>`Mr. Hattersley sometimes offers his services instead of mine, but 
Arthur will not let me go: that strange whim still increases, as his 
strength declines—the fancy to have me always by his side. I hardly 
ever leave him, except to go into the next room, where I sometimes 
snatch an hour or so of sleep when he is quiet; but even then, the door 
is left ajar that he may know me to be within call. I am with him now, 
while I write; and I fear my occupation annoys him; though I frequently 
break off to attend to him, and though Mr. Hattersley is also by his 
side. That gentleman came, as he said, to beg a holiday for me, that 
I might have a run in the park, this fine, frosty morning, with 
Milicent, and Esther, and little Arthur, whom he had driven over to see 
me. Our poor invalid evidently felt it a heartless proposition, and 
would have felt it still more heartless in me to accede to it. I 
therefore said I would only go and speak to them a minute, and then 
come back. I did but exchange a few words with them, just outside the 
portico—inhaling the fresh, bracing air as I stood—and then, 
resisting the earnest and eloquent entreaties of all three to stay a 
little longer, and join them in a walk round the garden,—I tore myself 
away and returned to my patient. I had not been absent five minutes, 
but he reproached me bitterly for my levity and neglect. His friend 
espoused my cause:— 
</p>
               <p>`”Nay, nay, Huntingdon,” said he, “you're too hard upon her—she must 
have food and sleep, and a mouthful of fresh air now and then, or she 
can't stand it I tell you. Look at her, man, she's worn to a shadow 
already.” 
</p>
               <p>“What are her sufferings to mine?” said the poor invalid. “You don't 
grudge me these attentions, do you, Helen?” 
</p>
               <p>`”No, Arthur, if I could really serve you by them. I would give my life 
to save you, if I might.” 
</p>
               <p>`”Would you <hi>indeed</hi>?—No!” 
</p>
               <p> `”Most willingly, I would.” 
</p>
               <p>`”Ah! that's because you think yourself more fit to die!” 
</p>
               <p>`There was a painful pause. He was evidently plunged in gloomy 
reflections, but while I pondered for something to say, that might 
benefit without alarming him, Hattersley, whose mind had been pursuing 
almost the same course, broke silence with,— 
</p>
               <p>`”I say, Huntingdon, I <hi>could</hi> send for a parson, of some 
sort.—If you didn't like the vicar, you know, you could have his 
curate, or somebody else.” 
</p>
               <p>`”No; none of them can benefit me if <hi>she</hi> can't,” was the answer. 
And the tears gushed from his eyes as he earnestly exclaimed,—“Oh, 
Helen, if I had listened to you, it never would have come to this! And 
if I had heard you long ago—oh, God! how different it would have 
been!” 
</p>
               <p>`”Hear me now, then, Arthur,” said I, gently pressing his hand. 
</p>
               <p>`”It's too late now,” said he despondently. And after that another 
paroxysm of pain came on; and then his mind began to wander, and we 
feared his death was approaching; but an opiate was administered, his 
sufferings began to abate, he gradually became more composed, and at 
length sank into a kind of slumber. He has been quieter since; and now 
Hattersley has left him, expressing a hope that he shall find him 
better when he calls to-morrow. 
</p>
               <p> `”Perhaps, I <hi>may</hi> recover,” he replied, “who knows?—this may 
have been the crisis. What do <hi>you</hi> think, Helen?” 
</p>
               <p>`Unwilling to depress him, I gave the most cheering answer I could, but 
still recommended him to prepare for the possibility of what I only 
feared was but too certain. But he was determined to hope Shortly 
after, he relapsed into a kind of doze—but now he groans again. 
</p>
               <p>`There is a change. Suddenly he called me to his side, with such a 
strange, excited manner that I feared he was delirious—but he was not. 
“That <hi>was</hi> the crisis, Helen!” said he delightedly. “I had an 
infernal pain here—it is quite gone now; I never was so easy since the 
fall.bite gone, by Heaven!” and he clasped and kissed my hand in the 
very fullness of his heart; but, finding I did not participate his joy, 
he quickly flung it from him, and bitterly cursed my coldness and 
insensibility. How could I reply? Kneeling beside him, I took his hand 
and fondly pressed it to my lips—for the first time since our 
separation—and told him as well as tears would let me speak, that it 
was not <hi>that</hi> that kept me silent; it was the fear that this 
sudden cessation of pain was not so favourable a symptom as he 
supposed.a immediately sent for the doctor. We are now anxiously 
awaiting him: I will tell you what he says. There is still the same 
freedom from pain—the same deadness to all sensation where the 
suffering was most acute. 
</p>
               <p>`My worst fears are realized—mortification has commenced. The doctor 
has told him there is no hope—no words can describe his anguish—I can 
write no more.' 
</p>
               <p>——————- 
</p>
               <p>The next was still more distressing in the tenor of its contents. The 
sufferer was fast approaching dissolution—ragged almost to the verge 
of that awful chasm he trembled to contemplate, from which no agony of 
prayers or tears could save him. Nothing could comfort him now: 
Hattersley's rough attempts at consolation were utterly in vain. The 
world was nothing to him: life and all its interests, its petty cares 
and transient pleasures were a cruel mockery. To talk of the past, was 
to torture him with vain remorse; to refer to the future, was to 
increase his anguish; and yet to be silent, was to leave him a prey to 
his own regrets and apprehensions. Often he dwelt with shuddering 
minuteness on the fate of his perishing clay—the slow, piece-meal 
dissolution already invading his frame; the shroud, the coffin, the 
dark, lonely grave, and all the horrors of corruption. 
</p>
               <p>`If I try,' said his afflicted wife, `to divert him from these 
things—to raise his thoughts to higher themes, it is no 
better:—“Worse and worse!” he groans. “If there be really life beyond 
the tomb, and judgment after death, how <hi>can</hi> I face it?”—I 
cannot do him any good; he will neither be enlightened, nor roused, nor 
comforted by anything I say; and yet he clings to me with unrelenting 
pertinacity—with a kind of childish desperation, as if <hi>I</hi> could 
save him from the fate he dreads. He keeps me night and day beside him. 
He is holding my left hand now, while I write; he has held it thus for 
hours: sometimes quietly, with his pale face upturned to mine: 
sometimes clutching my arm with violence:—the big drops starting from 
his forehead, at the thoughts of what he sees, or thinks he sees before 
him. If I withdraw my hand for a moment, it distresses him:— 
</p>
               <p>`”Stay with me, Helen,” he says; “let me hold you so: it seems as if 
harm could not reach me while you are here. But death <hi>will</hi> comet 
is coming now—fast, fast!—and—oh, if I <hi>could</hi> believe there 
was nothing after!' 
</p>
               <p>“Don't try to believe it, Arthur; there is joy and glory after, if you 
will but try to reach it!” 
</p>
               <p>`”What, for <hi>me</hi>?” he said, with something like a laugh. “Are we 
not to be judged according to the deeds done in the body? Where's the 
use of a probationary existence, if a man may spend it as he pleases, 
just contrary to God's decrees, and then go to Heaven with the best—if 
the vilest sinner may win the reward of the holiest saint, by merely 
saying, “I repent?” 
</p>
               <p>“But if you <hi>sincerely</hi> repent—” 
</p>
               <p>“I <hi>can't</hi> repent; I only fear.” 
</p>
               <p>`”You only regret the past for its consequences to yourself?” 
</p>
               <p>`”Just so—except that I'm sorry to have wronged you Nell, because 
you're so good to me.” 
</p>
               <p>`”Think of the goodness of God, and you cannot but be grieved to have 
offended Him.” 
</p>
               <p>`”What <hi>is</hi> God?—I cannot see Him or hear Him.—God is only an 
idea.” 
</p>
               <p>`”God is Infinite Wisdom, and Power, and Goodness—and LOVE; but if 
this idea is too vast for your human faculties—if your mind loses 
itself in its overwhelming infinitude, fix it on Him who condescended 
to take our nature upon Him, who was raised to Heaven even in His 
glorified human body, in whom the fullness of the godhead shines.” 
</p>
               <p>`But he only shook his head and sighed. Then, in another paroxysm of 
shuddering horror, he tightened his grasp on my hand and arm, and 
groaning and lamenting, still clung to me with that wild, desperate 
earnestness so harrowing to my soul, because I know I cannot help him. 
I did my best to sooth and comfort him. 
</p>
               <p>“Death is so terrible,” he cried, “I cannot bear it! <hi>You</hi> don't 
know, Helen—you can't imagine what it is, because you haven't it 
before you; and when I'm buried, you'll return to your old ways and be 
as happy as ever, and all the world will go on just as busy and merry 
as if I had never been; while I 
</p>
               <p>He burst into tears. 
</p>
               <p>“You needn't let <hi>that</hi> distress you,” I said; “we shall all 
follow you soon enough.” 
</p>
               <p>`”I wish to God I could take you with me now!” he exclaimed, “you 
should plead for me.” 
</p>
               <p>`”No man can deliver his brother, nor make agreement unto God for him,” 
I replied: “`it cost more to redeem their souls'—it cost the blood of 
an incarnate God, perfect and sinless in Himself, to redeem us from the 
bondage of the evil one;—let <hi>Him</hi> plead for you.” 
</p>
               <p>`But I seem to speak in vain. He does not now, as formerly, laugh these 
blessed truths to scorn: but still he cannot trust, or will not 
comprehend them. He cannot linger long. He suffers dreadfully, and so 
do those that wait upon him—But I will not harass you with further 
details: I have said enough, I think, to convince you that I did well 
to go to' 
</p>
               <p>——————— 
</p>
               <p>Poor, poor Helen! dreadful indeed her trials must have been! And I 
could do nothing to lessen them—nay, it almost seemed as if I had 
brought them upon her myself, by my own secret desires; and whether I 
looked at her husband's sufferings or her own, it seemed almost like 
a judgment upon myself for having cherished such a wish. 
</p>
               <p>The next day but one, there came another letter. That too was put into 
my hands without a remark, and these are its contents:— 
</p>
               <p>DEC. 5th. 
</p>
               <p>He is gone at last. I sat beside him all night, with my hand fast 
locked in his, watching the changes of his features and listening to 
his failing breath. He had been silent a long time, and I thought he 
would never speak again, when he murmured, faintly but distinctly— 
</p>
               <p>`Pray for me, Helen!' 
</p>
               <p>`I do pray for you—very hour and every minute, Arthur; but you must 
pray for yourself.' 
</p>
               <p>His lips moved but emitted no sound;—when his looks became unsettled; 
and, from the incoherent half-uttered words that escaped him from time 
to time, supposing him to be now unconscious, I gently disengaged my 
hand from his, intending to steal away for a breath of air, for I was 
almost ready to faint; but a convulsive movement of the fingers, and 
a faintly whispered `Don't leave me!' immediately recalled me: I took 
his hand again, and held it till he was no mor—and then I fainted; it 
was not grief; it was exhaustion that, till then, I had been enabled 
successfully to combat. Oh Frederick! none can imagine the miseries, 
bodily and mental, of that death bed! How could I endure to think that 
that poor trembling soul was hurried away to everlasting torment? it 
would drive me mad! But thank God I have hope—not only from a vague 
dependence on the possibility that penitence and pardon might have 
reached him at the last, but from the blessed confidence that, through 
whatever purging fires the erring spirit may be doomed to 
pass—whatever fate awaits it, still, it is not lost, and God, who 
hateth nothing that He hath made, <hi>will</hi> bless it in the end! 
</p>
               <p>His body will be consigned on Thursday to that dark grave he so much 
dreaded; but the coffin must be closed as soon as possible. If you will 
attend the funeral come quickly, for I need help. 
</p>
               <p>HELEN HUNTINGDON.

               <head>CHAPTER L</head>
               <head>DOUBTS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS</head>
               <p>On reading this, I had no reason to disguise my joy and hope from 
Frederick Lawrence, for I had none to be ashamed of. I felt no joy but 
that his sister was at length released from her afflictive, 
overwhelming toil—no hope but that she would in time recover from the 
effects of it, and be suffered to rest in peace and quietness, at 
least, for the remainder of her life. I experienced a painful 
commiseration for her unhappy husband (though fully aware that he had 
brought every particle of his sufferings upon himself, and but too well 
deserved them all), and a profound sympathy for her own afflictions, 
and deep anxiety for the consequences of those harassing cares, those 
dreadful vigils, that incessant and deleterious confinement beside a 
living corps—or I was persuaded she had not hinted half the sufferings 
she had had to endure. 
</p>
               <p>`You will go to her, Lawrence?' said I, as I put the letter into his 
hand. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, immediately.' 
</p>
               <p>`That's right! I'll leave you, then, to prepare for your departure.' 
</p>
               <p>`I've done that, already, while you were reading the letter, and before 
you came; and the carriage is now coming round to the door.' 
</p>
               <p>Inly approving his promptitude, I bade him good morning, and withdrew. 
He gave me a searching glance as we pressed each other's hands at 
parting; but whatever he sought in my countenance, he saw there nothing 
but the most becoming gravity, it might be, mingled with a little 
sternness in momentary resentment at what I suspected to be passing in 
his mind. 
</p>
               <p>Had I forgotten my own prospects, my ardent love, my pertinacious 
hopes? It seemed like sacrilege to revert to them now, but I had not 
forgotten them. It was, however, with a gloomy sense of the darkness 
of those prospects, the fallacy of those hopes, and the vanity of that 
affection, that I reflected on those things as I remounted my horse and 
slowly journeyed homewards. Mrs. Huntingdon was free now; it was no 
longer a crime to think of her—But did she ever think of 
<hi>me</hi>?—not <hi>now</hi> course it was not to be expected—But would 
she, when this shock was over?—In all the course of her correspondence 
with her brother (our mutual friend, as she herself had called him), 
she had never mentioned me but once—and that was from necessity. This, 
alone, afforded strong presumption that I was already forgotten; yet 
this was not the worst: it might have been her sense of duty that had 
kept her silent, she might be only <hi>trying</hi> to forget; but in 
addition to this, I had a gloomy conviction that the awful realities 
she had seen and felt, her reconciliation with the man she had once 
loved, his dreadful sufferings and death, must eventually efface from 
her mind all traces of her passing love for me. She might recover from 
these horrors so far as to be restored to her former health, her 
tranquillity, her cheerfulness even—But never to those feelings which 
would appear to her, henceforth, as a fleeting fancy, a vain; illusive 
dream; especially as there was no one to remind her of my existence—no 
means of assuring her of my fervent constancy, now that we were so far 
apart, and delicacy forbade me to see her or to write to her, for 
months to come at least. And how could I engage her brother in my 
behalf? how could I break that icy crust of shy reserve? Perhaps he 
would disapprove of my attachment now, as highly as before; perhaps he 
would think me too poor—too lowly born, to match with his sister. Yes, 
there was another barrier: doubtless there was a wide distinction 
between the rank and circumstances of Mrs. Huntingdon, the lady of 
Grassdale Manor, and those of Mrs. Graham the artist, the tenant of 
Wildfell Hall; and it might be deemed presumption in me to offer my 
hand to the former—by the world, by her friends—if not by herself—a 
penalty I might brave, if I were certain she loved me; but otherwise, 
how could I? And, finally, her deceased husband, with his usual 
selfishness, might have so constructed his will as to place 
restrictions upon her marrying again. So that you see I had reasons 
enough for despair if I chose to indulge it. 
</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, it was with no small degree of impatience that I looked 
forward to Mr. Lawrence's return from Grassdale—impatience that 
increased in proportion as his absence was prolonged. He stayed away 
some ten or twelve days. All very right that he should remain to 
comfort and help his sister, but he might have written to tell me how 
she was,—or at least to tell me when to expect his return; for he 
might have known I was suffering tortures of anxiety for her, and 
uncertainty for my own future prospects. And when he did return, all 
he told me about her, was that she had been greatly exhausted and worn 
by her unremitting exertions in behalf of that man who had been the 
scourge of her life, and had dragged her with him nearly to the portals 
of the grave,—and was still much shaken and depressed by his 
melancholy end and the circumstances attendant upon it; but no word in 
reference to memo intimation that my name had ever passed her lips, or 
even been spoken in her presence. To be sure, I asked no questions on 
the subject: I could not bring my mind to do so, believing, as I did, 
that Lawrence was indeed averse to the idea of my union with his 
sister. 
</p>
               <p>I saw that he expected to be further questioned concerning his visit, 
and I saw too, with the keen perception of awakened jealousy, or 
alarmed self-esteem—or by whatever name I ought to call it—that he 
rather shrank from that impending scrutiny, and was no less pleased 
than surprised to find it did not come. Of course, I was burning with 
anger, but pride obliged me to suppress my feelings, and preserve a 
smooth face—or at least, a stoic calmness throughout the interview. 
It was well it did, for, reviewing the matter in my sober judgment, I 
must say it would have been highly absurd and improper to have 
quarrelled with him on such an occasion: I must confess too that I 
wronged him in my heart: the truth was, he liked me very well, but he 
was fully aware that a union between Mrs. Huntingdon and me would be 
what the world calls a mesalliance; and it was not in his nature to set 
the world at defiance;—especially in such a case as this, for its 
dread laugh, or ill opinion, would be far more terrible to him directed 
against his sister than himself. Had he believed that a union was 
necessary to the happiness of both, or of either, or had he known how 
fervently I loved her, he would have acted differently; but seeing me 
so calm and cool, he would not for the world disturb my philosophy; and 
though refraining entirely from any active opposition to the match, he 
would yet do nothing to bring it about, and would much rather take the 
part of prudence, in aiding us to overcome our mutual predilections, 
than that of feeling, to encourage them. `And he was in the right of 
it,' you will say. Perhaps he was—at any rate, I had no business to 
feel so bitterly against him as I did; but I could not then regard the 
matter in such a moderate light; and, after a brief conversation upon 
indifferent topics, I went away, suffering all the pangs of wounded 
pride and injured friendship, in addition to those resulting from the 
fear that I was indeed forgotten, and the knowledge that she I loved 
was alone and afflicted, suffering from injured health and dejected 
spirits, and I was forbidden to console or assist her—forbidden even 
to assure her of my sympathy, for the transmission of any such message 
through Mr. Lawrence was now completely out of the question. 
</p>
               <p>But what should I do? I would wait, and see if she would notice 
me—which of course she would not, unless by some kind message 
intrusted to her brother, that, in all probability, he would not 
deliver, and then—dreadful thought!—she would think me cooled and 
changed for not returning it—or perhaps, he had already given her to 
understand that I had ceased to think of her! I would wait, however, 
till the six months after our parting were fairly passed (which would 
be about the close of February), and then I would send her a letter 
modestly reminding her of her former permission to write to her at the 
close of that period, and hoping I might avail myself of it, at least 
to express my heart-felt sorrow for her late afflictions, my just 
appreciation of her generous conduct, and my hope that her health was 
now completely re-established, and that she would, some time, be 
permitted to enjoy those blessings of a peaceful, happy life, which had 
been denied her so long, but which none could more truly be said to 
merit than herself,—adding a few words of kind remembrance to my 
little friend Arthur, with a hope that he had not forgotten me, and, 
perhaps, a few more in reference to by-gone times—to the delightful 
hours I had passed in her society, and my unfading recollection of 
them, which was the salt and solace of my life,—and a hope that her 
recent troubles had not entirely banished me from her mind.—If she did 
not answer this, of course I should write no more: if she did (as 
surely she would, in <hi>some </hi> fashion) my future proceedings should 
be regulated by her reply. 
</p>
               <p>Ten weeks was long to wait in such a miserable state of uncertainty, 
but courage! it must be endured;—and meantime I would continue to see 
Lawrence now and then, though not so often as before, and I would still 
pursue my habitual enquiries after his sister—if he had lately heard 
from her, and how she was, but nothing more. 
</p>
               <p>I did so, and the answers I received were always provokingly limited 
to the letter of the enquiry: She was much as usual: She made no 
complaints, but the tone of her last letter evinced great depression 
of mind:She said she was better:—and, finally:—She said she was well, 
and very busy with her son's education, and with the management of her 
late husband's property and the regulation of his affairs. The rascal 
had never told me how that property was disposed, or whether Mr. 
Huntingdon had died intestate or not; and I would sooner die than ask 
him, lest he should misconstrue into covetousness my desire to know. 
He never offered to show me his sister's letters now; and I never 
hinted a wish to see them. February, however, was approaching; December 
was past, January, at length, was almost overt few more weeks, and 
then, certain despair or renewal of hope would put an end to this long 
agony of suspense. 
</p>
               <p>But alas! it was just about that time she was called to sustain another 
blow in the death of her uncle worthless old fellow enough, in himself, 
I dare say, but he had always shown more kindness and affection to her 
than to any other creature, and she had always been accustomed to 
regard him as a parent. She was with him when he died, and had assisted 
her aunt to nurse him during the last stage of his illness. Her brother 
went to Staningley to attend the funeral, and told me, upon his return, 
that she was still there, endeavouring to cheer her aunt with her 
presence, and likely to remain some time. This was bad news for me, for 
while she continued there, I could not write to her, as I did not know 
the address, and would not ask it of him. But week followed week, and 
every time I enquired about her she was still at Staningley. 
</p>
               <p>`Where <hi>is</hi> Staningley?' I asked at last. 
</p>
               <p>`In  shire,' was the brief reply: and there was something so cold and 
dry in the manner of it, that I was effectually deterred from 
requesting a more definite account. 
</p>
               <p>`When will she return to Grassdale?' was my next question. 
</p>
               <p>`I don't know.' 
</p>
               <p>`Confound it!' I muttered. 
</p>
               <p>`Why, Markham?' asked my companion, with an air of inns cent surprise. 
But I did not deign to answer him, save by a look of silent, sullen 
contempt, at which he turned away, and contemplated the carpet with a 
slight smile, half pensive, half amused; but quickly looking up, he 
began to talk of other subjects, trying to draw me into a cheerful and 
friendly conversation; but I was too much irritated to discourse with 
him, and soon took leave. 
</p>
               <p>You see Lawrence and I somehow could not manage to get on very well 
together. The fact is, I believe, we were both of us a little too 
touchy. It is a troublesome thing Halford, this susceptibility to 
affronts where none are intended. I am no martyr to it now, as you can 
bear me witness: I have learned to be merry and wise, to be more easy 
with myself and more indulgent to my neighbours, and I can afford to 
laugh at both Lawrence and you. 
</p>
               <p>Partly from accident, partly from wilful negligence on my part (for I 
was really beginning to dislike him), several weeks elapsed before I 
saw my friend again. When we did meet, it was <hi>he</hi> that sought 
<hi>me</hi> out. One bright morning early in June, he came into the field 
where I was just commencing my hay harvest. 
</p>
               <p>`It is long since I saw you, Markham,' said he after the first few 
words had passed between us. `Do you never mean to come to Woodford 
again?' 
</p>
               <p>`I called once, and you were out.' 
</p>
               <p>`I was sorry: but that was long since; I hoped you would call again; 
and now, <hi>I</hi> have called, and <hi>you</hi> were out—which you 
generally are, or I would do myself the pleasure of calling more 
frequently—But being determined to see you this time, I have left my 
pony in the lane, and come over hedge and ditch to join you; for I am 
about to leave Woodford for a while, and may not have the pleasure of 
seeing you again for a month or two.' 
</p>
               <p>`Where are you going?' 
</p>
               <p>`To Grassdale first,' said he, with a half-smile he would willingly 
have suppressed if he could. 
</p>
               <p>`To Grassdale! Is she there, then?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, but in a day or two she will leave it to accompany Mrs. Maxwell 
to F for the benefit of the sea air; and I shall go with them.' (F was 
at that time a quiet but respectable watering place: it is considerably 
more frequented now.) 
</p>
               <p>Lawrence seemed to expect me to take advantage of this circumstance to 
intrust him with some sort of a message to his sister; and I believe 
he would have undertaken to deliver it without any material objections, 
if I had had the sense to ask him; though of course he would not 
<hi>offer</hi> to do so, if I was content to let it alone. But I could 
not bring myself to make the request; and it was not till after he was 
gone, that I saw how fair an opportunity I had lost;and then, indeed, 
I deeply regretted my stupidity and my foolish pride; but it was now 
too late to remedy the evil. 
</p>
               <p>He did not return till towards the latter end of August. He wrote to 
me twice or thrice from F; but his letters were most provokingly 
unsatisfactory, dealing in generalities or in trifles that I cared 
nothing about, or replete with fancies and reflections equally 
unwelcome to me at the time,—saying next to nothing about his sister, 
and little more about himself. I would wait, however, till he came 
back: perhaps I could get something more out of him then. At all 
events, I would not write to her now, while she was with him and her 
aunt, who doubtless would be still more hostile to my presumptuous 
aspirations than himself. When she was returned to the silence and 
solitude of her own home it would be my fittest opportunity. 
</p>
               <p>When Lawrence came, however, he was as reserved as ever on the subject 
of my keen anxiety. He told me that his sister had derived considerable 
benefit from her stay at F—, that her son was quite well, and—alas! 
that both of them were gone, with Mrs. Maxwell, back to 
Staningley;—and there they stayed at least three months. But instead 
of boring you with my chagrin, my expectations and disappointments, my 
fluctuations of dull despondency and flickering hope, my varying 
resolutions, now to drop it, and now to persevere—now to make a bold 
push, and now to let things pass and patiently abide my time,—I will 
employ myself in settling the business of one or two of the characters, 
introduced in the course of this narrative, whom I may not have 
occasion to mention again. 
</p>
               <p>Sometime before Mr. Huntingdon's death, Lady Lowborough eloped with 
another gallant to the continent, where, having lived awhile in 
reckless gaiety and dissipation, they quarrelled and parted. She went 
dashing on for a season, but years came and money went: she sunk, at 
length, in difficulty and debt, disgrace and misery; and died at last, 
as I have heard, in penury, neglect, and utter wretchedness. But this 
might be only a report: she may be living yet for anything I, or any 
of her relatives or former acquaintances can tell; for they have all 
lost sight of her long years ago, and would as thoroughly forget her 
if they could. Her husband, however, upon this second misdemeanour, 
immediately sought and obtained a divorce, and, not long after, married 
again. It was well he did, for Lord Lowborough, morose and moody as he 
seemed, was not the man for a bachelor's life. No public interests, no 
ambitious projects, or active pursuits,—or ties of friendship even (if 
he had had any friends), could compensate to him for the absence of 
domestic comforts and endearments. He had a son and a nominal daughter, 
it is true, but they too painfully reminded him of their mother, and 
the unfortunate little Annabella was a source of perpetual bitterness 
to his soul. He had obliged himself to treat her with paternal 
kindness: he had forced himself not to hate her, and even, perhaps, to 
feel some degree of kindly regard for her, at last, in return for her 
artless and unsuspecting attachment to himself; but the bitterness of 
his self-condemnation for his inward feelings towards that innocent 
being, his constant struggles to subdue the evil promptings of his 
nature (for it was not a generous one), though partly guessed at by 
those who knew him, could be known to God and his own heart alone;—so 
also was the hardness of his conflicts with the temptation to return 
to the vice of his youth, and seek oblivion for past calamities, and 
deadness to the present misery of a blighted heart, a joyless, 
friendless life, and a morbidly disconsolate mind, by yielding again 
to that insidious foe to health, and sense, and virtue, which had so 
deplorably enslaved and degraded him before. 
</p>
               <p>The second object of his choice was widely different from the first. 
Some wondered at his taste; some even ridiculed it—but in this their 
folly was more apparent than his. The lady was about his own age—i.e. 
between thirty and forty—remarkable neither for beauty nor wealth, nor 
brilliant accomplishments; nor any other thing that I ever heard of, 
except genuine good sense, unswerving integrity, active piety, 
warmhearted benevolence, and a fund of cheerful spirits. These 
qualities however, as you may readily imagine, combined to render her 
an excellent mother to the children, and an invaluable wife to his 
lordship. <hi>He,</hi> with his usual self-depreciation (or 
appreciation?) thought her a world too good for him, and while he 
wondered at the kindness of Providence in conferring such a gift upon 
him, and even at her taste in preferring him to other men, he did his 
best to reciprocate the good she did him, and so far succeeded that she 
was, and I believe still is, one of the happiest and fondest wives in 
England; and all who question the good taste of either partner, may be 
thankful if <hi>their</hi> respective selections afford them half the 
genuine satisfaction in the end, or repay their preference with 
affection half as lasting and sincere. 
</p>
               <p>If you are at all interested in the fate of that low scoundrel, 
Grimsby, I can only tell you that he went from bad to worse, sinking 
from bathos to bathos of vice and villany, consorting only with the 
worst members of his club and the lowest dregs of society—happily for 
the rest of the world—and at last met his end in a drunken brawl from 
the hands, it is said, of some brother scoundrel he had cheated at 
play. 
</p>
               <p>As for Mr. Hattersley, he had never wholly forgotten his resolution to 
`come out from among them,' and behave like a man and a Christian, and 
the last illness and death of his once jolly friend Huntingdon, so 
deeply and seriously impressed him with the evil of their former 
practices, that he never needed another lesson of the kind. Avoiding 
the temptations of the town, he continued to pass his life in the 
country immersed in the usual pursuits of a hearty, active country 
gentleman; his occupations being those of farming, and breeding horses 
and cattle, diversified with a little hunting and shooting, and 
enlivened by the occasional companionship of his friends (better 
friends than those of his youth), and the society of his happy little 
wife (now cheerful and confiding as heart could wish) and his fine 
family of stalwart sons and blooming daughters. His father, the banker, 
having died some years ago and left him all his riches, he has now full 
scope for the exercise of his prevailing tastes, and I need not tell 
you that Ralph Hattersley, Esqr., is celebrated throughout the country 
for his noble breed of horses.

               <head>CHAPTER LI</head>
               <head>AN UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE</head>
               <p>We will now turn to a certain still, cold, cloudy afternoon about the 
commencement of December, when the first fall of snow lay thinly 
scattered over the blighted fields and frozen roads, or stored more 
thickly in the hollows of the deep cart ruts and footsteps of men and 
horses, impressed in the now petrified mire of last month's drenching 
rains. I remember it well, for I was walking home from the vicarage, 
with no less remarkable a personage than Miss Eliza Millward by my 
side. I had been to call upon her iather,—a sacrifice to civility 
undertaken entirely to please my mother, not myself, for I hated to go 
near the house; not merely on account of my antipathy to the once so 
bewitching Eliza, but because I had not half forgiven the old gentleman 
himself for his ill opinion of Mrs. Huntingdon; for though now 
constrained to acknowledge himself mistaken in his former judgment, he 
still maintained that she had done wrong to leave her husband; it was 
a violation of her sacred duties as a wife, and a tempting of 
Providence by laying herself open to temptation; and nothing short of 
bodily ill-usage (and that of no trifling nature) could excuse such a 
step—or even that, for in such a case she ought to appeal to the laws 
for protection. But it was not of him I intended to speak; it was of 
his daughter Eliza. Just as I was taking leave of the vicar, she 
entered the room, ready equipped for a walk. 
</p>
               <p>     `I was just coming to see your sister, Mr. Markham,' said she; 
`and so if you have no objection, I'll accompany you home. I like 
company when I'm walking out—don't you?' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes, when it's agreeable.' 
</p>
               <p>     `That of course,' rejoined the young lady, smiling archly. So we 
proceeded together. 
</p>
               <p>     `Shall I find Rose at home, do you think?' said she, as we closed 
the garden gate, and set our faces towards Lirden-car. 
</p>
               <p>     `I believe so.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I trust I shall, for I've a little bit of news for her—if you 
haven't forestalled me.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I?' 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes: do you know what Mr. Lawrence is gone for?' She looked up 
anxiously for my reply. 
</p>
               <p>     `<hi>Is</hi> he gone?' said I, and her face brightened. 
</p>
               <p>     `Ah! then he hasn't told you about his sister?' 
</p>
               <p>     `What of <hi>her</hi>?' I demanded, in terror lest some evil should 
have befallen her. 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh, Mr. Markham, how you blush!' cried she with a tormenting 
laugh. `Ha, ha, you have not forgotten her yet! But you had better be 
quick about it, I can tell you, for alas, alas!—she's going to be 
married next Thursday!' 
</p>
               <p>     `No, Miss Eliza! that's false.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Do you charge me with a falsehood, sir?' 
</p>
               <p>     `You are misinformed.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Am I? Do you know better then?' 
</p>
               <p>     `I think I do.' 
</p>
               <p>     `What makes you look so pale then?' said she, smiling with 
delight at my emotion. `Is it anger at poor me for telling such a fib? 
Well, I only “tell the tale as 'twas told to me:” I don't vouch for the 
truth of it; but at the same time, I don't see what reason Sarah should 
have for deceiving me, or her informant for deceiving her; and that was 
what she told me the footman told her:—that Mrs. Huntingdon was going 
to be married on Thursday, and Mr. Lawrence was gone to the wedding. 
She did tell me the name of the gentleman, but I've forgotten that. 
Perhaps you can assist me to remember it. Is there not some one that 
lives near—or frequently visits the neighbourhood, that has long been 
attached to her? a Mr.—oh dear!—Mr.—' 
</p>
               <p>     `Hargrave?' suggested I, with a bitter smile. 
</p>
               <p>     `You're right!' cried she, `that was the very name.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Impossible, Miss Eliza!' I exclaimed in a tone that made her 
start. 
</p>
               <p>     `Well, you know, that's what they told me,' said she, composedly 
staring me in the face. And then she broke out into a long shrill laugh 
that put me to my wits' end with fury. 
</p>
               <p>     `Really, you must excuse me,' cried she: `I know it's very rude, 
but ha, ha, ha!—Did you think to marry her yourself? Dear, dear, what 
a pity! ha, ha, ha!—Gracious, Mr. Markham! are you going to faint? O 
mercy! shall I call this man? Here, Jacob—' But checking the word on 
her lips, I seized her arm and gave it, I think, a pretty severe 
squeeze, for she shrank into herself with a faint cry of pain or 
terror; but the spirit within her was not subdued: instantly rallying, 
she continued, with well feigned concern— 
</p>
               <p>     `What can I do for you? Will you have some water—some brandy?—I 
dare say they have some in the public-house down there, if you'll let 
me run.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Have done with this nonsense!' cried I sternly. She looked 
confounded—almost frightened again, for a moment. `You know I hate 
such jests,' I continued. 
</p>
               <p>     `<hi>Jests</hi> indeed! I wasn't <hi>jesting</hi>!' 
</p>
               <p>      `You were laughing, at all events; and I don't like to be 
laughed at,' returned I, making violent efforts to speak with proper 
dignity and composure, and to say nothing but what was coherent and 
sensible. `And since you are in such a merry mood, Miss Eliza, you must 
be good enough company for yourself, and therefore I shall leave you 
to finish your walk alone—for, now I think of it, I have business 
elsewhere; so good evening.' 
</p>
               <p>     With that I left her (smothering her malicious laughter) and 
turned aside into the fields, springing up the bank, and pushing 
through the nearest gap in the hedge. Determined at once to prove the 
truth—or rather the falsehood of her story, I hastened to Woodford as 
fast as my legs could carry me—first, veering round by a circuitous 
course, but the moment I was out of sight of my fair tormentor, cutting 
away across the country, just as a bird might fly—over pastureland and 
fallow, and stubble, and lane—clearing hedges and ditches, and 
hurdles, till I came to the young squire's gates. Never till now had 
I known the full fervour of my love—the full strength of my hopes, not 
wholly crushed even in my hours of deepest despondency, always 
tenaciously clinging to the thought that one day she might be mine—or 
if not that, at least that something of my memory, some slight 
remembrance of our friendship and our love would be for ever cherished 
in her heart. I marched up to the door, determined if I saw the master, 
to question him boldly concerning his sister, to wait and hesitate no 
longer, but cast false delicacy and stupid pride behind my back, and 
know my fate at once. 
</p>
               <p>     `Is Mr. Lawrence at home?' I eagerly asked of the servant that 
opened the door. 
</p>
               <p>     `No sir, master went yesterday,' replied he, looking very 
alert. 
</p>
               <p>     `Went where?' 
</p>
               <p>     `To Grassdale, sir—wasn't you aware, sir? He's very close, is 
master,' said the fellow with a foolish, simpering grin. `I suppose, 
sir—' 
</p>
               <p>     But I turned and left him, without waiting to hear what he 
supposed. I was not going to stand there to expose my tortured feelings 
to the insolent laughter and impertinent curiosity of a fellow like 
that. 
</p>
               <p>     But what was to be done now? Could it be possible that she had 
left me for <hi>that</hi> man? I could not believe it. Me she might 
forsake, but <hi>not</hi> to give herself to him! Well, I would know the 
truth—to no concerns of daily life could I attend; while this tempest 
of doubt and dread, of jealousy and rage distracted me. I would take 
the morning coach from L—- (the evening one would be already gone), 
and fly to Grassdale, I <hi>must</hi> be there before the marriage. And 
why? Because a thought struck me, that <hi>perhaps</hi> I might prevent 
it—that if I did not, she and I might both lament it to the latest 
moment of our lives. It struck me that some one might have belied me 
to her: perhaps her brother—yes, no doubt her brother had persuaded 
her that I was false and faithless, and taking advantage of her natural 
indignation, and perhaps her desponding carelessness about her future 
life, had urged her, artfully, cruelly on, to this other marriage in 
order to secure her from me. If this <hi>was</hi> the case, and if she 
should only discover her mistake when too late to repair it—to what 
a life of misery and vain regret might she be doomed as well as me! and 
what remorse for me, to think my foolish scruples had induced it all! 
Oh, I <hi>must</hi> see her—she must know my truth even if I told it at 
the church door! I might pass for a madman or an impertinent fool—even 
she might be offended at such an interruption, or at least might tell 
me it was now too lat—but if I <hi>could</hi> save her! if she 
<hi>might</hi> be mint was too rapturous a thought! 
</p>
               <p>      Winged by this hope, and goaded by these fears, I hurried 
homewards to prepare for my departure on the morrow. I told my mother 
that urgent business which admitted no delay, but which I could not 
then explain, called me away to (the last large town through which I 
had to pass). My deep anxiety and serious preoccupation, could not be 
concealed from her maternal eyes; and I had much ado to calm her 
apprehensions of some disastrous mystery. 
</p>
               <p>     That night there came a heavy fall of snow, which so retarded the 
progress of the coaches on the following day, that I was almost driven 
to distraction. I travelled all night of course, for this was 
Wednesday: tomorrow morning, doubtless, the marriage would take place. 
But the night was long and dark; the snow heavily clogged the wheels 
and balled the horses' feet; the animals were consumedly lazy, the 
coachmen most execrably cautious, the passengers confoundedly apathetic 
in their supine indifference to the rate of our progression. Instead 
of assisting me to bully the several coachmen and urge them forward, 
they merely stared and grinned at my impatience: one fellow even 
ventured to rally me upon it—but I silenced him with a look that 
quelled him for the rest of the journey;—and when, at the last stage, 
I would have taken the reins into my own hand, they all with one accord 
opposed it. 
</p>
               <p>     It was broad daylight when we entered M—- and drew up at the 
Rose and Crown. I alighted and called aloud for a postchaise to 
Grassdale. There was none to be had: the only one in the town was under 
repair. `A gig then—-fly—car—anything—only be quick!' There was a 
gig but not a horse to spare. I sent into the town to seek one; but 
they were such an intolerable time about it that I could wait no 
longer: I thought my own feet would carry me sooner, and bidding them 
send the confounded conveyance after me, if it were ready within an 
hour, I set off as fast as I could walk. The distance was little more 
than six miles, but the road was strange, and I had to keep stopping 
to enquire my way—hallooing to carters and clod-hoppers, and 
frequently invading the cottages, for there were few abroad that 
winter's morning,—sometimes knocking up the lazy people from their 
beds, for where so little work was to be done—perhaps so little food 
and fire to be had, they cared not to curtail their slumbers. I had no 
time to think of <hi>them</hi>, however: aching with weariness and 
desperation, I hurried on. The gig did not overtake me: it was well I 
had not waited for it—vexatious rather, that I had been fool enough 
to wait so long. 
</p>
               <p>     At length however, I entered the neighbourhood of Grassdale. I 
approached the little rural church—but lo! there stood a train of 
carriages before it—it needed not the white favours bedecking the 
servants and horses, nor the merry voices of the village idlers 
assembled to witness the show, to apprize me that there was a wedding 
within. I ran in among them', demanding, with breathless eagerness, had 
the ceremony long commenced? They only gaped and stared. In my 
desperation I pushed past them, and was about to enter the church-yard 
gate, when a group of ragged urchins, that had been hanging like bees 
to the windows, suddenly dropped off and made a rush for the porch, 
vociferating in the uncouth dialect of their county, something which 
signified, `It's over—they're coming out!' 
</p>
               <p>     If Eliza Millward had seen me then, she might indeed have been 
delighted. I grasped the gate-post for support, and stood intently 
gazing towards the door to take my last look on my soul's delight, my 
first on that detested mortal who had torn her from my heart, and 
doomed her, I was certain, to a life of misery and hollow, vain 
repining—for what happiness could she enjoy with him? I did not wish 
to shock her with my presence now, but I had not power to move away. 
Forth came the bride and bridegroom. Him I saw not; I had eyes for none 
but her. A long veil shrouded half her graceful form, but did not hide 
it; I could see that while she carried her head erect, her eyes were 
bent upon the ground, and her face and neck were suffused with a 
crimson blush; but every feature was radiant with smiles, and, gleaming 
through the misty whiteness of her veil, were clusters of golden 
ringlets! O Heavens! it was <hi>not</hi> my Helen! The first glimpse made 
me start—but my eyes were darkened with exhaustion and despair—dare 
I trust them? Yes—it <hi>is</hi> not she! It was a younger, slighter, 
rosier beauty—lovely, indeed, but with far less dignity and depth of 
soul—without that indefinable grace, that keenly <hi>spirituel</hi> yet 
gentle charm, that ineffable power to attract and subjugate the 
heart—my heart at least. I looked at the bridegroom—it was Frederick 
Lawrence! I wiped away the cold drops that were trickling down my 
forehead, and stepped back as he approached; but his eye fell upon me, 
and he knew me, altered as my appearance must have been. 
</p>
               <p>     `Is that you Markham?' said he, startled and confounded at the 
apparition—perhaps, too, at the wildness of my looks. 
</p>
               <p>     `Yes, Lawrence—is that you?' I mustered the presence of mind to 
reply. 
</p>
               <p>     He smiled and coloured, as if half-proud and half-ashamed of his 
identity; and if he had reason to be proud of the sweet lady on his 
arm, he had no less cause to be ashamed of having concealed his good 
fortune so long. 
</p>
               <p>     `Allow me to introduce you to my bride,' said he, endeavouring 
to hide his embarrassment by an assumption of careless gaiety. `Esther, 
this is Mr. Markham, my friend Markham, Mrs. Lawrence, late Miss 
Hargrave.' 
</p>
               <p>     I bowed to the bride, and vehemently wrung the bridegroom's 
hand. 
</p>
               <p>     `Why did you not tell me of this?' I said reproachfully, 
pretending a resentment I did not feel (for in truth I was almost wild 
with joy to find myself so happily mistaken, and overflowing with 
affection to him for this and for the base injustice I felt that I had 
done him in my mind—he might have wronged me, but not to <hi>that</hi>
extent; and as I had hated him like a demon for the last forty hours, 
the reaction from such a feeling was so great that I could pardon all 
offences for the moment—and love him in spite of them too). 
</p>
               <p>     `I <hi>did tell</hi> you,' said he, with an air of guilty 
confusion, `you received my letter?' 
</p>
               <p>     `What letter?' 
</p>
               <p>     `The one announcing my intended marriage.' 
</p>
               <p>     `I never received the most distant hint of such an intention.' 
</p>
               <p>     `It must have crossed you on your way then—it should have 
reached you yesterday morning—it was rather late, I acknowledge. But 
what brought you here then, if you received no information?' 
</p>
               <p>     It was now <hi>my</hi> turn to be confounded; but the young lady, 
who had been busily patting the snow with her foot during our short, 
sotto voce colloquy, very opportunely came to my assistance by pinching 
her companion's arm and whispering a suggestion that his friend should 
be invited to step into the carriage and go with them; it being 
scarcely agreeable to stand there among so many gazers, and keeping 
their friends waiting, into the bargain. 
</p>
               <p>     `And so cold as it is too!' said he, glancing with dismay at her 
slight drapery, and immediately handing her into the carriage. 
`Markham, will you come? We are going to Paris, but we can drop you 
anywhere between this and Dover.' 
</p>
               <p>     `No thank you. Good bye—I needn't wish you a pleasant journey; 
but I shall expect a very handsome apology, some time, mind, and scores 
of letters, before we meet again.' 
</p>
               <p>     He shook my hand and hastened to take his place beside his lady. 
This was no time or place for explanation or discourse: we had already 
stood long enough to excite the wonder of the village sightseers, and 
perhaps the wrath of the attendant bridal party; though, of course, all 
this passed in a much shorter time than I have taken to relate or even 
than you will take to read it. I stood beside the carriage, and, the 
window being down, I saw my happy friend fondly encircle his 
companion's waist with his arm, while she rested her glowing cheek on 
his shoulder, looking the very impersonation' of loving, trusting 
bliss. In the interval between the footman's closing the door and 
taking his place behind, she raised her smiling brown eyes to his face, 
observing playfully— 
</p>
               <p>     `I fear you must think me very insensible, Frederick: I know it 
is the custom for ladies to cry on these occasions, but I couldn't 
squeeze a tear for my life.' 
</p>
               <p>     He only answered with a kiss, and pressed her still closer to his 
bosom. 
</p>
               <p>     `But what is this?' he murmured. `Why, Esther, you're crying 
now!' 
</p>
               <p>     `Oh, it's nothing—it's only too much happiness—and the wish,' 
sobbed she, `that our dear Helen were as happy as ourselves.' 
</p>
               <p>     `Bless you for that wish!' I inwardly responded as the carriage 
rolled away—`and Heaven grant it be not wholly vain!' 
</p>
               <p>      I thought a cloud had suddenly darkened her husband's face as 
she spoke. What did <hi>he</hi> think? Could he grudge such happiness to 
his dear sister and his friend as he now felt himself? At <hi>such</hi>
a moment it was impossible. The contrast between her fate and his 
<hi>must</hi> darken his bliss for a time. Perhaps too he thought of me: 
perhaps he regretted the part he had had in preventing our union, by 
omitting to help us, if not by actually plotting against us—I 
exonerated him from <hi>that</hi> charge, now, and deeply lamented my 
former ungenerous suspicions; but he <hi>had</hi> wronged us, still—I 
hoped, I trusted that he had. He had not attempted to check the course 
of our love by actually damming up the streams in their passage, but 
he had passively watched the two currents wandering through life's arid 
wilderness, declining to clear away the obstructions that divided them, 
and secretly hoping that both would lose themselves in the sand before 
they could be joined in one. And meantime, he had been quietly 
proceeding with his own affairs: perhaps his heart and head had been 
so full of his fair lady that he had had but little thought to spare 
for others. Doubtless he had made his first acquaintance with her—his 
first intimate acquaintance at least—during his three months' sojourn 
at F , for I now recollected that he had once casually let fall an 
intimation that his aunt and sister had a young friend staying with 
them at the time, and this accounted for at least one half his silence 
about all transactions there. Now too I saw a reason for many little 
things that had slightly puzzled me before; among the rest, for sundry 
departures from Woodford, and absences more or less prolonged, for 
which he never satisfactorily accounted, and concerning which he hated 
to be questioned on his return. Well might the servant say his master 
was `very close.' But why this strange reserve to <hi>me?</hi> Partly, 
from that remarkable idiosyncrasy to which I have before alluded; 
partly, perhaps, from tenderness to my feelings, or fear to disturb my 
philosophy by touching upon the infectious theme of love.

               <head>CHAPTER LII</head>
               <head>FLUCTUATIONS</head>
               <p>The tardy gig had overtaken me at last. I entered it, and bade the man 
who brought it drive to Grassdale Manor—I was too busy with my own 
thoughts to care to drive it myself. I would see Mrs. Huntingdon—there 
could be no impropriety in that now that her husband had been dead 
above a year—and by her indifference or her joy at my unexpected 
arrival, I could soon tell whether her heart was truly mine. But my 
companion, a loquacious, forward fellow, was not disposed to leave me 
to the indulgence of my private cogitations. 
</p>
               <p>`There they go!' said he as the carriages filed away before us. 
`There'll be brave doings on yonder <hi>to-day</hi>, as what come 
tomorra.—Know anything of that family, sir? or you're a stranger in 
these parts?' 
</p>
               <p>`I know them by report.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humph!—There's the best of `em gone anyhow. And I suppose the old 
missis is agoing to leave after this stir's gotten overed, and take 
herself off, somewhere, to live on her bit of a jointure, and the young 
`unit least the new `un (she's none so very young) is coming down to 
live at the Grove.' 
</p>
               <p>`Is Mr. Hargrave married, then?' 
</p>
               <p>`Ay sir, a few months since. He should a been wed afore, to a widow 
lady, but they couldn't agree over the money: she'd a rare long purse, 
and Mr. Hargrave wanted it all to his-self, but she wouldn't let it go, 
and so then they fell out. This one isn't quite as rich—nor as 
handsome either, but she hasn't been married before. She's very plain 
they say, and getting on to forty or past, and so, you know, if she 
didn't jump at this hopportunity, she thought she'd never get a better. 
I guess she thought such a handsOme young husband was worth all `at 
ever she had, and he might take it and welcome; but I lay she'll rue 
her bargain afore long. They say she begins already to see 'at he isn't 
not altogether that nice, generous, perlite, delightful gentleman 'at 
she thought him afore marriage begins a being careless, and masterful 
already. Ay, and 
she'll find him harder and carelesser nor she thinks on.' 
</p>
               <p>`You seem to be well acquainted with him,' I observed. 
</p>
               <p>`I am, sir; I've known him since he was quite a young gentleman; and a 
proud'un he was, 
and a wilful. I was servant yonder for several years; but I couldn't stand 
their niggardly 
ways—she got ever longer and worse did Missis, with her nipping and 
screwing, and 
watching and grudging; so I thought I'd find another place as <hi>what</hi>
came.' 
</p>
               <p>And then he discoursed upon his present position as ostler at the Rose and 
Crown, and 
how greatly superior it was to his former one, in comfort and freedom, though 
inferior in 
outward respectability; and entered into various details respecting the 
domestic economy at 
the Grove, and the characters of Mrs. Hargrave and her son,—to which I gave 
no heed, 
being too much occupied with my own anxious, fluttering anticipations and 
with the 
character of the country through which we passed, that, in spite of the 
leafless trees and 
snowy ground, had for some time begun to manifest unequivocal signs of the 
approach to 
a gentleman's country seat. 
</p>
               <p>`Are we not near the house?' said I, interrupting him in the middle of his 
discourse. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, sir; yond's the park.' 
</p>
               <p>My heart sank within me to behold that stately mansion in the midst of its 
expansive 
grounds-he park as beautiful now, in its wintry garb, as it could be in its 
summer glory; 
the majestic sweep, the undulating swell and fall, displayed to full 
advantage in that robe 
of dazzling purity, stainless and printless—save one long, winding track 
left by the 
trooping deer—the stately timber-trees with their heavy laden branches 
gleaming white 
against the dull, grey sky; the deep, encircling woods; the broad expanse of 
water sleeping 
in frozen quiet; and the weeping ash and willow drooping their snowclad 
boughs above 
it—all presented a picture, striking, indeed, and pleasing to an 
unencumbered mind, but by 
no means encouraging to me. There was one comfort however,-all this was 
entailed upon 
little Arthur, and could not under any circumstances, strictly speaking, be 
his mother's. 
But how was she situated? Overcoming with a sudden effort my repugnance to 
mention 
her name to my garrulous companion, I asked him if he knew whether her 
late husband had left a will, and how the property had been disposed 
of. Oh, yes, he knew all about it; and I was quickly informed that to 
her had been left the full control and management of the estate during 
her son's minority, besides the absolute, unconditional possession of 
her own fortune (but I knew her father had not given her much), and the 
small additional sum that had been settled upon her before marriage. 
</p>
               <p>Before the close of the explanation, we drew up at the park gates. Now 
for the trial—if I should find her within—but alas! she might be 
still at Staningley: her brother had given me no intimation to the 
contrary. I enquired at the porter's lodge if Mrs. Huntingdon were at 
home. No, she was with her aunt in —-hire, but was expected to return 
before Christmas. She usually spent most of her time at Staningley, 
only coming to Grassdale occasionally, when the management of affairs, 
or the interest of her tenants and dependants required her presence. 
</p>
               <p>`Near what town is Staningley situated?' I asked. The requisite 
information was soon obtained. `Now then, my man, give me the reins, 
and we'll return to M—-. I must have some breakfast at the Rose and 
Crown, and then away to Staningley by the first coach for—-” 
</p>
               <p>`You'll not get there to-day, sir.' 
</p>
               <p>`No matter, I don't want to get there to-day; I want to get there 
to-morrow, and pass the night on the road.' 
</p>
               <p>`At an inn, sir? You'd better by half stay at <hi>our</hi> house; and 
then start fresh to-morrow, and have the whole day for your journey.' 
</p>
               <p>`What, and lose twelve hours? not I.' 
</p>
               <p>`Perhaps, sir, you're <hi>related</hi> to Mrs. Huntingdon?' said he, 
seeking to indulge his curiosity since his cupidity was not to be 
gratified. 
</p>
               <p>`I have not that honour.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ah! well,' returned he with a dubious, sidelong glance at my splashed, 
grey trousers and rough P jacket. `But,' he added, encouragingly, 
`there's many a fine lady like that `at has kinsfolks poorer nor what 
you are, sir, I should think.' 
</p>
               <p>`No doubt,—and there's many a fine gentleman would esteem himself 
vastly honoured to be able to claim kindred with the lady you mention.' 
</p>
               <p>He now cunningly glanced at my face. `Perhaps, sir, you <hi>mean</hi>
to—' 
</p>
               <p>I guessed what was coming, and checked the impertinent conjecture 
with,—`Perhaps you'll be so good as to be quiet a moment. I'm busy. 
</p>
               <p>`Busy, sir?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, in my mind, and don't want to have my cogitations disturbed.' 
</p>
               <p>`Indeed, sir!' 
</p>
               <p>You will see that my disappointment had not <hi>very</hi> greatly 
affected me, or I should not have been able so quietly to bear with the 
fellow's impertinence. The fact is I thought it as well—nay better, 
all things considered, that I should not see her to-day,—that I should 
have time to compose my mind for the interview—to prepare it for a 
heavier disappointment, after the intoxicating delight experienced by 
this sudden removal of my former apprehensions; not to mention that, 
after travelling a night and a day without intermission, and rushing 
in hot haste through six miles of new-fallen snow, I could not possibly 
be in a very presentable condition. 
</p>
               <p>At M— I had time before the coach started to replenish my forces with 
a hearty breakfast, and to obtain the refreshment of my usual morning's 
ablutions, and the amelioration of some slight change in my 
toilet,—and also to dispatch a short note to my mother (excellent son 
that I was) to assure her that I was still in existence and to excuse 
my nonappearance at the expected time. It was a long journey to 
Staningley for those slow travelling days; but I did not deny myself 
needful refreshment on the road, nor even a night's rest at a way-side 
inn; choosing rather to brook a little delay than to present myself 
worn, wild, and weatherbeaten before my mistress and her aunt, who 
would be astonished enough to see me without that. Next morning, 
therefore, I not only fortified myself with as substantial a breakfast 
as my excited feelings would allow me to swallow, but I bestowed a 
little more than usual time and care upon my toilet; and, furnished 
with a change of linen from my small carpet-bag, well brushed clothes, 
well polished boots, and neat new gloves,—I mounted `the Lightning,' 
and resumed my journey. I had nearly two stages yet before me, but the 
coach, I was informed, passed through the neighbourhood of Staningley, 
and, having desired to be set down as near the Hall as possible, I had 
nothing to do but to sit with folded arms and speculate upon the coming 
hour. 
</p>
               <p>It was a clear, frosty morning. The very fact of sitting exalted aloft, 
surveying the snowy landscape and sweet, sunny sky, inhaling the pure, 
bracing air, and crunching away over the crisp, frozen snow, was 
exhilarating enough in itself, but add to this the idea of to what goal 
I was hastening, and whom I expected to meet, and you may have some 
faint conception of my frame of mind at the time—only a <hi>faint</hi>
one though, for my heart swelled with unspeakable delight, and my 
spirits rose almost to madness—in spite of my prudent endeavours to 
bind them down to a reasonable platitude' by thinking of the undeniable 
difference between Helen's rank and mine; of all that she had passed 
through since our parting; of her long, unbroken silence; and, above 
all, of her cool, cautious aunt, whose counsels she would doubtless be 
careful not to slight again. These considerations made my heart flutter 
with anxiety, and my chest heave with impatience to get the crisis 
over, but they could not dim her image in my mind, or mar the vivid 
recollection of what had been said and felt between us—or destroy the 
keen anticipation of what was to be—in fact, I could not realize their 
terrors now. Towards the close of the journey, however, a couple of my 
fellow passengers kindly came to my assistance, and brought me low 
enough. 
</p>
               <p>`Fine land this,' said one of them, pointing with his umbrella to the 
wide fields on the right, conspicuous for their compact hedgerows, 
deep, well-cut ditches, and fine timber-trees, growing sometimes on the 
borders, sometimes in the midst of the enclosure;—`very fine land, if 
you saw it in the summer or spring.' 
</p>
               <p>`Ay,' responded the others gruff elderly man, with a drab great coat 
buttoned up to the chin and a cotton umbrella between his knees. `It's 
old Maxwell's I suppose.' 
</p>
               <p>`It <hi>was</hi> his, sir, but he's dead now, you're aware, and has left 
it all to his niece.' 
</p>
               <p>`All!' 
</p>
               <p>`Every rood of it,—and the mansion-house and all,—every hatom of his 
worldly goods!—except just a trifle, by way of remembrance to his 
nephew down in —-hire and an annuity to his wife.' 
</p>
               <p>`It's strange, sir!' 
</p>
               <p>`It is sir. And she wasn't his own niece neither; but he had no near 
relations of his own—none but a nephew he'd quarrelled with—and he 
always had a partiality for this one. And then his wife advised him to 
it, they say: she'd brought most of the property, and it was her wish 
that this lady should have it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Humph!—She'll be a fine catch for somebody.' 
</p>
               <p>`She will so. She's a widow, but quite young yet, and uncommon handsome 
fortune of her own, besides, and only one child—and she's nursing a 
fine estate for him in ——— There'll be lots to speak for 
her!—'fraid there's no chance for uz'—(facetiously jogging me with 
his elbow, as well as his companion)—`ha, ha, ha! No offence, sir, I 
hope?' (to me) `Ahem!—I should think she'll marry none but a nobleman, 
myself. Look ye sir,' resumed he, turning to his other neighbour, and 
pointing past me with his umbrella, `that's the Hall—grand park, you 
see—and all them woods—plenty of timber there, and lots of 
game—hallo! what now?' 
</p>
               <p>This exclamation was occasioned by the sudden stoppage of the coach at 
the park gates. 
</p>
               <p>`Gen'leman for Staningley Hall?' cried the coachman; and I rose and 
threw my carpet-bag on to the ground, preparatory to dropping myself 
down after it. 
</p>
               <p>`Sickly, sir?' asked my talkative neighbour, staring me in the face (I 
dare say it was white enough). 
</p>
               <p>`No. Here, coachman.' 
</p>
               <p>`Thank'ee, sir.—All right!' 
</p>
               <p>The coachman pocketed his fee and drove away, leaving me not walking 
up the park, but pacing to and fro before its gates, with folded arms 
and eyes fixed upon the ground—in overwhelming force of images, 
thoughts, impressions crowding on my mind, and nothing tangibly 
distinct but this:—My love had been cherished in vain; my hope was 
gone for ever; I must tear myself away at once, and banish or suppress 
all thoughts of her like the remembrance of a wild, mad dream. Gladly 
would I have lingered round the place for hours, in the hope of 
catching, at least one distant glimpse of her before I went, but it 
must not be: I must not suffer her to see me; for what could have 
brought me hither but the hope of reviving her attachment, with a view, 
hereafter to obtain her hand? And could I bear that she should think 
me capable of such a thing?—of presuming upon the acquaintance—the 
<hi>love</hi> if you will—accidentally contracted, or rather forced upon 
her against her will, when she was an unknown fugitive, toiling for her 
own support, apparently without fortune, family or connections—to come 
upon her now, when she was re-instated in her proper sphere, and claim 
a share in her prosperity, which, had it never failed her, would most 
certainly have kept her unknown to me for ever? and this too, when we 
had parted sixteen months ago, and she had expressly forbidden me to 
hope for a re-union in this world—and never sent me a line or a 
message from that day to this? No! The very idea was intolerable. 
</p>
               <p>And even if she should have a lingering affection for me still, ought 
I to disturb her peace by awakening those feelings? to subject her to 
the struggles of conflicting duty and inclination—to whichsoever side 
the latter might allure, or the former imperatively call her—whether 
she should deem it her duty to risk the slights and censures of the 
world, the sorrow and displeasure of those she loved, for a romantic 
idea of truth and constancy to me, or to sacrifice her individual 
wishes to the feelings of her friends and her own sense of prudence and 
the fitness of things? No—and I would not! I would go at once, and she 
should never know that I had approached the place of her abode; for 
though I might disclaim all idea of ever aspiring to her hand, or even 
of soliciting a place in her friendly regard, her peace should not be 
broken by my presence, nor her heart afflicted by the sight of my 
fidelity. 
</p>
               <p>`Adieu then, dear Helen, for ever!—For ever adieu!' 
</p>
               <p>So said I—and yet I could not tear myself away. I moved a few paces, 
and then looked back, for one last view of her stately home, that I 
might have its outward form, at least impressed upon my mind as 
indelibly as her own image, which alas! I must not see again—then, 
walked a few steps farther; and then lost in melancholy musings, paused 
again and leant my back against a rough old tree that grew beside the 
road.

               <head>CHAPTER LIII</head>
               <head>CONCLUSION</head>
               <p>While standing thus, absorbed in my gloomy reverie, a gentleman's carriage 
came round 
the 
corner of the road. I did not look at it; and had it rolled quietly by me, I 
should not have 
remembered the fact of its appearance at all; but a tiny voice from within it 
roused me by 
exclaiming— 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma, mamma, here's Mr. Markham!' 
</p>
               <p>I did not hear the reply, but presently the same voice answered— 
</p>
               <p>`It is indeed, mamma—look for yourself.' 
</p>
               <p>I did not raise my eyes, but I suppose mamma looked, for a clear, melodious 
voice, whose 
tones thrilled through my nerves, exclaimed— 
</p>
               <p>`Oh, aunt! here's Mr. Markham—Arthur's friend!—Stop, Richard!' 
</p>
               <p>There was such evidence of joyous though suppressed excitement in the 
utterance of those 
few words—especially that tremulous, `Oh, aunt—' that it threw me almost 
off my guard. 
The 
carriage stopped immediately, and I looked up and met the eye of a pale, 
grave, elderly 
lady 
surveying me from the open window. She bowed and so did I, and then she 
withdrew her 
head, while Arthur screamed to the footman to let him out; but before that 
functionary 
could 
descend from his box, a hand was silently put forth from the carriage window. 
I knew that 
hand, though a black glove concealed its delicate whiteness and half its fair 
proportions, 
and 
quickly seizing it, I pressed it in my own—ardently for a moment, but 
instantly recollecting 
myself, I dropped it, and it was immediately withdrawn. 
</p>
               <p>`Were you coming to see us, or only passing by?' asked the low voice of its 
owner, who, 
I 
felt, was attentively surveying my countenance from behind the thick, black 
veil which 
with 
the shadowing panels, entirely concealed her own from me. 
</p>
               <p>`I—I came to see the place,' faltered I. 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`The place,' repeated she, in a tone which betokened more displeasure or 
disappointment 
than 
surprise. `Will you not enter it then?' 
</p>
               <p>`If you wish it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Can you doubt?' 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, yes! he must enter,' cried Arthur running round from the other door; 
and seizing my 
hand in both his, he shook it heartily. 
</p>
               <p>`Do you remember me, sir?' said he. 
</p>
               <p>`Yes, full well, my little man, altered though you are,' replied I, surveying 
the 
comparatively 
tall, slim young gentleman with his mother's image visibly stamped upon his 
fair, 
intelligent 
features, in spite of the blue eyes beaming with gladness, and the bright 
locks clustering 
beneath his cap. 
</p>
               <p>`Am I not grown?' said he, stretching himself up to his full height. 
</p>
               <p>`Grown! three inches upon my word!' 
</p>
               <p>`I was seven last birthday,' was the proud rejoinder. `In seven years more, I 
shall be as 
tall 
as you, nearly.' 
</p>
               <p>`Arthur,' said his mother, `tell him to come in. Go on Richard.' 
</p>
               <p>There was a touch of sadness as well as coldness in her voice, but I knew not 
to what to 
ascribe it. The carriage drove on and entered the gates before us. My little 
companion led 
me 
up the park, discoursing merrily all the way. Arrived at the Hall door, I 
paused on the 
steps 
and looked round me, waiting to recover my composure, if possible—or at any 
rate, to 
remember my new-formed resolutions and the principles on which they were 
founded; and 
it was not till Arthur had been for some time gently pulling my coat, and 
repeating his 
invitations to enter, that I at length consented to accompany him into the 
apartment where 
the 
ladies awaited us. 
</p>
               <p>Helen eyed me as I entered with a kind of gentle, serious scrutiny and 
politely asked after 
Mrs. Markham and Rose. I respectfully answered her enquiries. Mrs. Maxwell 
begged me 
to 
be seated, observing it was rather cold, but she supposed I had not travelled 
far that 
morning. 
</p>
               <p>`Not quite twenty miles,' I answered. 
</p>
               <p>`Not on foot!' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Madam, by coach.' 
</p>
               <p>`Here's Rachel, sir,' said Arthur, the only truly happy one amongst us, 
directing my 
attention 
to that worthy individual, who had just entered to take her mistress's 
things. She 
vouchsafed 
me an almost friendly smile of recognitions favour that demanded, at least, a 
civil 
salutation 
on my part, which was accordingly given and respectively returned—she had 
seen the error 
of her former estimation of my character. 
</p>
               <p>When Helen was divested of her lugubrious bonnet and veil, her heavy winter 
cloak &amp;c. 
she 
looked so like herself that I knew not how to bear it. I was particularly 
glad to see her 
beautiful black hair unstinted still and unconcealed in its glossy 
luxuriance. 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma has left off her widow's cap in honour of uncle's marriage,' observed 
Arthur, 
reading my looks with a child's mingled simplicity and quickness of 
observation. Mamma 
looked grave and Mrs. Maxwell shook her head. `And aunt Maxwell is never 
going to 
leave 
off hers,' persisted the naughty boy; but when he saw that his pertness was 
seriously 
displeasing and painful to his aunt, he went and silently put his arm round 
her neck, 
kissed 
her cheek, and withdrew to the recess of one of the great bay windows, where 
he quietly 
amused himself with his dog while Mrs. Maxwell gravely discussed with me the 
interesting 
topics of the weather, the season, and the roads. I considered her presence 
very useful as a 
check upon my natural impulses—an antidote to those emotions of tumultuous 
excitement 
which would otherwise have carried me away against my reason and my will, but 
just then 
I felt the restraint almost intolerable, and I had the greatest difficulty in 
forcing myself to 
attend to her remarks and answer them with ordinary politeness; for I was 
sensible that 
Helen 
was standing within a few feet of me beside the fire. I dared not look at 
her, but I felt her 
eye 
was upon me, and from one hasty, furtive glance, I thought her cheek was 
slightly flushed, 
and that her fingers, as she played with her watch chain, were agitated with 
that restless, 
trembling motion which betokens high excitement. 
</p>
               <p>`Tell me,' said she, availing herself of the first pause in the attempted 
conversation 
between 
her aunt and me, and speaking fast and low with her eyes bent on the gold 
chain—for I 
now 
ventured another glance—`Tell me how you all are at Lindenhope?—has nothing 
happened 
since I left you?' 
</p>
               <p>`I believe not.' 
</p>
               <p>`Nobody dead? nobody married?' 
</p>
               <p>`No.' 
</p>
               <p>`Or—or expecting to marry?—No old ties dissolved or new ones formed? no old 
friends 
forgotten or supplanted?' 
</p>
               <p>She dropped her voice so low in the last sentence that no one could have 
caught the 
concluding words but myself, and at the same time turned her eyes upon me 
with a 
dawning 
smile, most sweetly melancholy, and a look of timid though keen enquiry that 
made my 
cheeks tingle with inexpressible emotions. 
</p>
               <p>`I believe not,' I answered.—`Certainly not, if others are as little changed 
as I.' Her face 
glowed in sympathy with mine. 
</p>
               <p>`And you really did not mean to call?' she exclaimed. 
</p>
               <p>`I feared to intrude.' 
</p>
               <p>`To intrude!' cried she with an impatient gesture.—`What'—but as if 
suddenly recollecting 
her 
aunt's presence, she checked herself and turning to that lady continued—`Why 
aunt, this 
man 
is my brother's close friend and was my own intimate acquaintance (for a few 
short 
months 
at least), and professed a great attachment to my boy—and when he passes the 
house, so 
many 
scores of miles from his home, he declines to look in for fear of 
intruding!' 
</p>
               <p>`Mr. Markham is over modest,' observed Mrs. Maxwell. 
</p>
               <p>`Over ceremonious rather,' said her niece—`over—well, it's no matter.' And 
turning from 
me, 
she seated herself in a chair beside the table, and pulling a book to her by 
the cover, 
began 
to turn over the leaves in an energetic kind of abstraction. 
</p>
               <p>`If I had known,' said I, `that you would have honoured me by remembering me 
as an 
intimate acquaintance, I most likely should not have denied myself the 
pleasure of calling 
upon you, but I thought you had forgotten me long ago.' 
</p>
               <p>`You judged of others by yourself,' muttered she without raising her eyes 
from the book, 
but 
reddening as she spoke and hastily turning over a dozen leaves at once. 
</p>
               <p>There was a pause of which Arthur thought he might venture to avail himself 
to introduce 
his 
handsome young setter and show me how wonderfully it was grown and improved, 
and to 
ask 
after the welfare of its father Sancho. Mrs. Maxwell then withdrew to take 
off her things. 
Helen immediately pushed the book from her and after silently surveying her 
son, his 
friend, 
and his dog for a few moments, she dismissed the former from the room under 
pretence of 
wishing him to fetch his last new book to shew me. The child obeyed with 
alacrity; but I 
continued caressing the dog. The silence might have lasted till its master's 
return had it 
depended on me to break it, but, in half a minute or less, my hostess 
impatiently rose, and 
taking her former station on the rug between me and the chimney corner, 
earnestly 
exclaimed— 
</p>
               <p>`Gilbert, what is the matter with you?—why are you so changed?—It is a very 
indiscreet 
question I know,' she hastened to add: `perhaps, a very rude one—don't 
answer it if you 
think 
so—out I hate mysteries and concealments.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am not changed—Helen—unfortunately I am as keen and passionate as 
ever—it is not I, it 
is circumstances that are changed.' 
</p>
               <p>`What circumstances? Do tell me!' Her cheek was blanched with the very 
anguish of 
anxiety—could it be with the fear that I had rashly pledged my faith to 
another? 
</p>
               <p>`I'll tell you at once,' said I. `I will confess that I came here for the 
purpose of seeing you 
(not without some monitory misgivings at my own presumption, and fears that I 
should be 
as little welcome as expected when I came), but I did not know that this 
estate was yours, 
until enlightened on the subject of your inheritance by the conversation of 
two fellow 
passengers in the last stage of my journey; and then, I saw at once the folly 
of the hopes I 
had cherished and the madness of retaining them a moment longer; and though I 
alighted 
at 
your gates, I determined not to enter within them; I lingered a few minutes 
to see the 
place, 
but was fully resolved to return to M—- without seeing its mistress.' 
</p>
               <p>`And if my aunt and I had not been just returning from our morning drive, I 
should have 
seen 
and heard no more of you?' 
</p>
               <p>`I thought it would be better for both that we should not meet,' replied I as 
calmly as I 
could, 
but not daring to speak above my breath from conscious inability to steady my 
voice, and 
not 
daring to look in her face lest my firmness should forsake me altogether: `I 
thought an 
interview would only disturb your peace and madden me. But I am glad, now, of 
this 
opportunity of seeing you once more and knowing that you have not forgotten 
me, and of 
assuring you that I shall never cease to remember you.' 
</p>
               <p>There was a moment's pause. Mrs. Huntingdon moved away, and stood in the 
recess of 
the 
window. Did she regard this as an intimation that modesty alone prevented me 
from 
asking 
her hand? and was she considering how to repulse me with the smallest injury 
to my 
feelings? 
Before I could speak to relieve her from such a perplexity, she broke the 
silence herself 
by 
suddenly turning towards me and observing 
</p>
               <p>`You might have had such an opportunity before—as far I mean as regards 
assuring me of 
your kindly recollections, and yourself of mine, if you had written to 
me.' 
</p>
               <p>`I would have done so, but I did not know your address, and did not like to 
ask your 
brother, 
because I thought he would object to my writing—but this would not have 
deterred me for 
a 
moment, if I could have ventured to believe that you expected to hear from 
me, or even 
wasted a thought upon your unhappy friend; but your silence naturally led me 
to conclude 
myself forgotten. 
</p>
               <p>`Did you expect me to write to you then?' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Helen—Mrs. Huntingdon,' said I, blushing at the implied imputation, 
`certainly not; 
but 
if you had sent me a message through your brother, or even asked him about me 
now and 
then—' 
</p>
               <p>`I did ask about you, frequently. I was not going to do more,' continued she, 
smiling, `so 
long 
as you continued to restrict yourself to a few polite enquiries about my 
health.' 
</p>
               <p>`Your brother never told me that you had mentioned my name. 
</p>
               <p>`Did you ever ask him?' 
</p>
               <p>`No; for I saw he did not wish to be questioned about you, or to afford the 
slightest 
encouragement or assistance to my too obstinate attachment.' Helen did not 
reply. `And he 
was perfectly right,' added I. But she remained in silence looking out upon 
the snowy 
lawn. 
`Oh, I will relieve her of my presence!' thought I; and immediately I rose 
and advanced to 
take leave, with a most heroic resolution—but pride was at the bottom of it, 
or it could not 
have carried me through. 
</p>
               <p>`Are you going already?' said she, taking the hand I offered, and not 
immediately letting it 
go. 
</p>
               <p>`Why should I stay any longer?' 
</p>
               <p>`Wait till Arthur comes, at least.' 
</p>
               <p>Only too glad to obey, I stood and leant against the opposite side of the 
window. 
</p>
               <p>`You told me you were not changed,' said my companion: you are—very much 
so.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, Mrs. Huntingdon, I only ought to be.' 
</p>
               <p>`Do you mean to maintain that you have the same regard for me that you had 
when last 
we 
met?' 
</p>
               <p>`I have, but it would be wrong to talk of it now.' 
</p>
               <p>`It was wrong to talk of it then, Gilbert; it would not now—unless to do so 
would be to 
violate 
the truth.' 
</p>
               <p>I was too much agitated to speak; but, without waiting for an answer, she 
turned away her 
glistening eye and crimson cheek, and threw up the window and looked out, 
whether to 
calm 
her own excited feelings or to relieve her embarrassment,—or only to pluck 
that beautiful 
half-blown Christmas rose that grew upon the little shrub without, just 
peeping from the 
snow, that had hitherto, no doubt, defended it from the frost, and was now 
melting away 
in 
the sun. Pluck it however, she did, and having gently dashed the glittering 
powder from its 
leaves, approached it to her lips and said, 
</p>
               <p>`This rose is not so fragrant as a summer flower, but it has stood through 
hardships none 
of 
them could bear: the cold rain of winter has sufficed to nourish it, and its 
faint sun to 
warm 
it; the bleak winds have not blanched it, or broken its stem, and the keen 
frost has not 
blighted it. Look, Gilbert, it is still fresh and blooming as a flower can 
be, with the cold 
snow 
even now on its petals.—Will you have it?' 
</p>
               <p>I held out my hand: I dared not speak lest my emotion should overmaster me. 
She laid the 
rose across my palm, but I scarcely closed my fingers upon it, so deeply was 
I absorbed in 
thinking what might be the meaning of her words, and what I ought to do or 
say upon the 
occasion; whether to give way to my feelings or restrain them still. 
Misconstruing this 
hesitation into indifference—or reluctance even—to accept her gift, Helen 
suddenly 
snatched 
it from my hand, threw it out on to the snow, shut down the window with an 
emphasis, 
and 
withdrew to the fire. 
</p>
               <p>`Helen! what means this?' I cried, electrified at this startling change in 
her demeanour. 
</p>
               <p>`You did not understand my gift,' said she,—`or, what is worse, you despised 
it: I'm sorry 
I 
gave it you; but since I did make such a mistake, the only remedy I could 
think of, was to 
take it away.' 
</p>
               <p>`You misunderstood me, cruelly,' I replied, and in a minute I had opened the 
window 
again, 
leaped out, picked up the flower, brought it in, and presented it to her, 
imploring her to 
give 
it me again, and I would keep it for ever for her sake, and prize it more 
highly than 
anything 
in the world I possessed. 
</p>
               <p>`And will this content you?' said she as she took it in her hand. 
</p>
               <p>`It shall,' I answered. 
</p>
               <p>`There, then; take it.' 
</p>
               <p>I pressed it earnestly to my lips, and put it in my bosom, Mrs. Huntingdon 
looking on 
with 
a half sarcastic smile. 
</p>
               <p>`Now, are you going?' said she. 
</p>
               <p>`I will if—if I must.' 
</p>
               <p>`You are changed,' persisted she— `you are grown either very proud or very 
indifferent.' 
</p>
               <p>`I am neither, Helen—Mrs. Huntingdon. If you could see my heart— 
</p>
               <p>`You must be one,—if not both. And why Mrs. Huntingdon?—why not Helen, as 
before?' 
</p>
               <p>`Helen, then—dear Helen!' I murmured. I was in an agony of mingled love, 
hope, delight, 
uncertainty, and suspense. 
</p>
               <p>`The rose I gave you was an emblem of my heart,' said she; `would you take it 
away and 
leave me here alone?' 
</p>
               <p>`Would you give me your hand too, if I asked it?' 
</p>
               <p>`Have I not said enough?' she answered with a most enchanting smile. I 
snatched her hand 
and would have fervently kissed it, but suddenly checked myself and 
said,— 
</p>
               <p>`But have you considered the consequences?' 
</p>
               <p/>
               <p>`Hardly, I think, or I should not have offered myself to one too proud to 
take me, or too 
indifferent to make his affection outweigh my worldly goods.' 
</p>
               <p>Stupid blockhead that I was!—I trembled to clasp her in my arms, but dared 
not believe in 
so 
much joy, and yet restrained myself to say,— 
</p>
               <p>`But if you should repent!' 
</p>
               <p>`It would be your fault,' she replied: `I never shall, unless you bitterly 
disappoint me. If 
you 
have not sufficient confidence in my affection to believe this, let me 
alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`My darling angel—my own Helen,' cried I, now passionately kissing the hand 
I still 
retained, 
and throwing my left arm around her, `you never shall repent, if it depend on 
me 
alone.—But 
have you thought of your aunt?' I trembled for the answer and clasped her 
closer to my 
heart 
in the instinctive dread of losing my new-found treasure. 
</p>
               <p>`My aunt must not know of it yet,' said she. `She would think it a rash, wild 
step, because 
she could not imagine how well I know you; but she must know you herself, and 
learn to 
like 
you. You must leave us now, after lunch, and come again in spring, and make a 
longer 
stay, 
and cultivate her acquaintance; and I know you will like each other.' 
</p>
               <p>`And then you will be mine,' said I printing a kiss upon her lips, and 
another, and 
another—for I was as daring and impetuous now as I had been backward and 
constrained 
before. 
</p>
               <p>`No—in another year,' replied she, gently disengaging herself from my 
embrace, but still 
fondly clasping my hand. 
</p>
               <p>`Another year! Oh, Helen, I could not wait so long!' 
</p>
               <p>`Where is your fidelity?' 
</p>
               <p>`I mean I could not endure the misery of so long a separation.' 
</p>
               <p>`It would not be a separation: we will write every day; my spirit shall be 
always with you; 
and sometimes you shall see me with your bodily eye. I will not be such a 
hypocrite as to 
pretend that I desire to wait so long myself, but as my marriage is to please 
myself alone, 
I 
ought to consult my friends about the time of it.' 
</p>
               <p>`Your friends will disapprove.' 
</p>
               <p>`They will not greatly disapprove, dear Gilbert,' said she, earnestly kissing 
my hand—`they 
cannot, when they know you—or if they could, they would not be true friends; 
I should not 
care for their estrangement.—Now are you satisfied?' She looked up in my 
face with a 
smile 
of ineffable tenderness. 
</p>
               <p>`Can I be otherwise, with your love? And you do love me, Helen?' said I, not 
doubting 
the 
fact, but wishing to hear it confirmed by her own acknowledgment. 
</p>
               <p>`If you loved as I do,' she earnestly replied, `you would not have so nearly 
lost me—these 
scruples of false delicacy and pride would never thus have troubled you—you 
would have 
seen 
that the greatest worldly distinctions and discrepancies of rank, birth, and 
fortune are as 
dust 
in the balance compared with the unity of accordant thoughts and feelings, 
and truly 
loving, 
sympathizing hearts and souls.' 
</p>
               <p>`But this is too much happiness,' said I, embracing her again; `I have not 
deserved it 
Helen—I 
dare not believe in such felicity: and the longer I have to wait, the greater 
will be my 
dread 
that something will intervene to snatch you from me—and think, a thousand 
things may 
happen in a year!—I shall be in one long fever of restless terror and 
impatience all the 
time. 
And besides, winter is such a dreary season.' 
</p>
               <p>`I thought so too,' replied she gravely: `I would not be married in 
winter—in December, at 
least,' she added with a shudder—for in that month had occurred both the 
ill-starred 
marriage 
that had bound her to her former husband and the terrible death that released 
her—`and 
therefore, I said another year in spring.' 
</p>
               <p>`Next spring.' 
</p>
               <p>`No, no—next autumn, perhaps.' 
</p>
               <p>`Summer, then.' 
</p>
               <p>`Well, the close of summer. There now! be satisfied.' 
</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Arthur re-entered the room—good boy for keeping out 
so 
long. 
</p>
               <p>`Mamma, I couldn't find the book in either of the places you told me to look 
for it' (there 
was a conscious something in mamma's smile that seemed to say, `No, dear, I 
knew you 
could not'), `but Rachel got it for me at last. Look, Mr. Markham, a natural 
history with 
all 
kinds of birds and beasts in it, and the reading as nice as the pictures!' 
</p>
               <p>In great good humour, I sat down to examine the book and drew the little 
fellow between 
my 
knees. Had he come a minute before, I should have received him less 
graciously, but now 
I 
affectionately stroked his curling locks, and even kissed his ivory forehead: 
he was my 
own 
Helen's son, and therefore mine; and as such I have ever since regarded him. 
That pretty 
child is now a fine young man: he has realized his mother's brightest 
expectations, and is 
at 
present residing in Grassdale Manor with his young wife, the merry little 
Helen Hattersley, 
of yore. 
</p>
               <p>I had not looked through half the book, before Mrs. Maxwell appeared to 
invite me into 
the 
other room to lunch. That lady's cool, distant manners rather chilled me at 
first; but I did 
my 
best to propitiate her, and not entirely without success I think, even in 
that first short visit; 
for when I talked cheerfully to her, she gradually became more kind and 
cordial, and 
when 
I departed she bade me a gracious adieu, hoping erelong to have the pleasure 
of seeing me 
again. 
</p>
               <p>`But you must not go till you have seen the conservatory, my aunt's winter 
garden,' said 
Helen, as I advanced to take leave of her, with as much philosophy and 
self-command as I 
could summon to my aid. 
</p>
               <p>I gladly availed myself of such a respite, and followed her into a large and 
beautiful 
conservatory, plentifully furnished with flowers considering the season—but 
of course, I 
had 
little attention to spare for them. It was not however for any tender 
colloquy that my 
companion had brought me there:— 
</p>
               <p>`My aunt is particularly fond of flowers,' she observed, `and she is fond of 
Staningley too: 
I brought you here to offer a petition in her behalf that this may be her 
home as long as 
she 
lives, and—if it be not our home likewise—that I may often see her and be 
with her; for I 
fear 
she will be sorry to lose me; and, though she leads a retired and 
contemplative life, she is 
apt 
to get low-spirited if left too much alone.' 
</p>
               <p>`By all means, dearest Helen!—do what you will with your own. I should not 
dream of 
wishing your aunt to leave the place under any circumstances; and we will 
live either here 
or elsewhere as you and she may determine, and you shall see her as often as 
you like. I 
know she must be pained to part with you, and I am willing to make any 
reparation in my 
power. I love her for your sake, and her happiness shall be as dear to me as 
that of my 
own 
mother.' 
</p>
               <p>`Thank you, darling! you shall have a kiss for that. Good bye. There 
now—there 
Gilbert—-let 
me go—here's Arthur, don't astonish his infantile brain with your 
madness.' 
</p>
               <p>———————— 
</p>
               <p>But it is time to bring my narrative to a close—ny one but you would say I 
had made it 
too 
long already; but for your satisfaction, I will add a few words more; 
because, I know you 
will 
have a fellow-feeling for the old lady, and will wish to know the last of her 
history. I did 
come again in spring, and agreeably to Helen's injunctions, did my best to 
cultivate her 
acquaintance. She received me very kindly, having been doubtless, already 
prepared to 
think 
highly of my character, by her niece's too favourable report. I turned my 
best side out of 
course, and we got along marvellously well together. When my ambitious 
intentions were 
made known to her, she took it more sensibly than I had ventured to hope. Her 
only 
remark 
on the subject, in my hearing, was— 
</p>
               <p>`And so Mr. Markham, you are going to rob me of my niece I understand. Well! 
I hope 
God 
will prosper your union, and make my dear girl happy at last. Could she have 
been 
contented 
to remain single, I own I should have been better satisfied; but if she must 
marry again, I 
know of no one, now living and of a suitable age, to whom I would more 
willingly resign 
her 
than yourself, or who would be more likely to appreciate her worth and make 
her truly 
happy, 
as far as I can tell.' 
</p>
               <p>Of course I was delighted with the compliment, and hoped to show her she was 
not 
mistaken 
in her favourable judgment. 
</p>
               <p>`I have, however, one request to offer,' continued she. `It seems I am still 
to look on 
Staningley as my home: I wish you to make it yours likewise, for Helen is 
attached to the 
place and to mess I am to her. There are painful associations connected with 
Grassdale, 
which 
she cannot easily overcome; and I shall not molest you with my company or 
interference 
here: I am a very quiet person, and shall keep my own apartments and attend 
to my own 
concerns, and only see you now and then.' 
</p>
               <p>Of course I most readily consented to this; and we lived in the greatest 
harmony with our 
dear aunt until the day of her death, which melancholy event took place a few 
years 
after—melancholy, not to herself (for it came quietly upon her, and she was 
glad to reach 
her 
journey's end), but only to the few loving friends and grateful dependants 
she left 
behind. 
</p>
               <p>To return, however, to my own affairs: I was married in summer, on a glorious 
August 
morning. It took the whole eight months, and all Helen's kindness and 
goodness to boot, 
to 
overcome my mother's prejudices against my bride elect, and to reconcile her 
to the idea 
of 
my leaving Linden-car and living so far away. Yet she was gratified at her 
son's good 
fortune 
after all, and proudly attributed it all to his own superior merits and 
endowments. I 
bequeathed the farm to Fergus, with better hopes of its prosperity than I 
should have had a 
year ago under similar circumstances; for he had lately fallen in love with 
the vicar of 
L—-'s 
eldest daughter, a lady whose superiority had roused his latent virtues and 
stimulated him 
to 
the most surprising exertions, not only to gain her affection and esteem, and 
to obtain a 
fortune sufficient to enable him to aspire to her hand, but to render himself 
worthy of her, 
in 
his own eyes, as well as in those of her parents; and in the end he was 
successful, as you 
already know. As for myself, I need not tell you how happily my Helen and I 
have lived 
and 
loved together, and how blessed we still are in each other's society, and in 
the promising 
young scions that are growing up about us. We are just now looking forward to 
the advent 
of you and Rose, for the time of your annual visit draws nigh, when you must 
leave your 
dusty, smoky, noisy, toiling, striving city for a season of invigorating 
relaxation and social 
retirement with us. 
</p>
               <p>Till then, farewell, GILBERT MARKHAM. 
</p>
               <p>Staningley, June 10th, 1847.
