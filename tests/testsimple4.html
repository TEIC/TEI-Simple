            <h1 class="head">Extended prose: MARLEY'S GHOST</h1> <span class="simple_foo">1 @bar.jpg</span> 
            <p class="p">Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register
               of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief
               mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything
               he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p">Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly
               dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail
               as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors
               is in the simile; and my unhallowed <span class="pb">2 </span> hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me
               to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and
               he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his
               sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend,
               and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event,
               but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
               it with an undoubted bargain. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p">The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There
               is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful
               can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that
               Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable
               in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than
               there <span class="pb">3 </span> would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
               spot — say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance — literally to astonish his son's
               weak mind.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above
               the ware-house door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley.
               Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
               but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p">Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching,
               grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from
               which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and
               solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
               nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue;
               and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on
               his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He <span class="pb">4 </span> carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days;
               and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry
               weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more
               intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't
               know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast
               of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often <span class="q2">came down</span> handsomely, and Scrooge never did.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, <span class="q2">My dear Scrooge, how are you. When will you come to see me.</span> No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock,
               no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place,
               of Scrooge. Even the blindmen's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming
               on, would tug their owners into doorways <span class="pb">5 </span> and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, <span class="q2">No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master! </span></p> 
            <p class="p">But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the
               crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the
               knowing ones call <span class="q2">nuts</span> to Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">Once upon a time — of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve — old Scrooge
               sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal:
               and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating
               their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to
               warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already:
               it had not been light all day: and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring
               offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at
               every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of
               the <span class="pb">6 </span> narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping
               down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and
               was brewing on a large scale.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his
               clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge
               had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked
               like one coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his
               own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted
               that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white
               comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man
               of a strong imagination, he failed. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!</span> cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so
               quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach. <span class="pb">7 </span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Bah!</span> said Scrooge, <span class="q2">Humbug!</span></p> 
            <p class="p">He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's,
               that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and
               his breath smoked again. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Christmas a humbug, uncle!</span> said Scrooge's nephew. <span class="q2">You don't mean that, I am sure.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">I do,</span> said Scrooge. <span class="q2">Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? what reason have you to be merry?
                  You're poor enough.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Come, then,</span> returned the nephew gaily. <span class="q2">What right have you to be dismal? what reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.</span></p> 
            <p class="p">Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, <span class="q2">Bah!</span> again; and followed it up with <span class="q2">Humbug.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Don't be cross, uncle,</span> said the nephew.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">What else can I be,</span> returned the uncle, <span class="q2">when I live in such a world of fools as this Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas.
                  What's Christmas time to you but a time for <span class="pb">8 </span>paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour
                  richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round
                  dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,</span> said Scrooge indignantly, <span class="q2">every idiot who goes about with <span class="q2">Merry Christmas</span> on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly
                  through his heart. He should!</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Uncle!</span> pleaded the nephew.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Nephew!</span> returned the uncle, sternly, <span class="q2">keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Keep it!</span> repeated Scrooge's nephew. <span class="q2">But you don't keep it.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Let me leave it alone, then,</span> said Scrooge. <span class="q2">Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited,
                  I dare say,</span> returned the nephew: <span class="q2">Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas<span class="pb">9 </span> time, when it has come round — apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
                  origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that — as a good time: a kind,
                  forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar
                  of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely,
                  and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the
                  grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle,
                  though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it <span class="hi2">has</span> done me good, and <span class="hi2">will</span> do me good; and I say, God bless it!</span></p> 
            <p class="p">The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the
               impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Let me hear another sound from <span class="hi2">you</span>,</span> said Scrooge, <span class="q2">and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation. You're quite a powerful speaker,
                  sir,</span> he added, turning to his nephew. <span class="q2">I wonder you don't go into Parliament.</span><span class="pb">10 </span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.</span></p> 
            <p class="p">Scrooge said that he would see him — yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length
               of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">But why?</span> cried Scrooge's nephew. <span class="q2">Why?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Why did you get married?</span> said Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Because I fell in love.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Because you fell in love!</span> growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than
               a merry Christmas. <span class="q2">Good afternoon!</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason
                  for not coming now?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Good afternoon,</span> said Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Good afternoon,</span> said Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel,
                  to which<span class="pb">11 </span> I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep
                  my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Good afternoon!</span> said Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">And A Happy New Year!</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Good afternoon!</span> said Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the
               outer door to bestow the greeting of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was,
               was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">There's another fellow,</span> muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: <span class="q2">my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry
                  Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.</span></p> 
            <p class="p">This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. They were
               portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's
               office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him. 
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,</span> said one of the <span class="pb">12 </span>gentlemen, referring to his list. <span class="q2">Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr Scrooge, or Mr Marley?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Mr Marley has been dead these seven years,</span> Scrooge replied. <span class="q2">He died seven years ago, this very night.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,</span> said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.
            </p> 
            <p class="p">It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word <span class="q2">liberality</span>, Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">At this festive season of the year, Mr Scrooge,</span> said the gentleman, taking up a pen, <span class="q2">it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the
                  Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in
                  want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts,
                  sir.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Are there no prisons?</span> asked Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Plenty of prisons,</span> said the gentleman, laying down the pen again. <span class="pb">13 </span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">And the Union workhouses?</span> demanded Scrooge. <span class="q2">Are they still in operation?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">They are. Still,</span> returned the gentleman, <span class="q2">I wish I could say they were not.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?</span> said Scrooge.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Both very busy, sir.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop
                  them in their useful course,</span> said Scrooge. <span class="q2">I'm very glad to hear it.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to
                  the multitude,</span> returned the gentleman, <span class="q2">a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,
                  and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when
                  Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Nothing!</span> Scrooge replied.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">You wish to be anonymous?</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">I wish to be left alone,</span> said Scrooge. <span class="q2">Since <span class="pb">14 </span> you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at
                  Christmas and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments
                  I have mentioned: they cost enough: and those who are badly off must go there.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">Many can't go there; and many would rather die.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">If they would rather die,</span> said Scrooge, <span class="q2">they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides — excuse me —
                  I don't know that.</span></p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">But you might know it,</span> observed the gentleman.
            </p> 
            <p class="p"><span class="q2">It's not my business,</span> Scrooge returned. <span class="q2">It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other
                  people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!</span></p> 
            <p class="p">Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew.
               Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious
               temper than was usual with him. <span class="pb">15 </span></p> 
            <p class="p">Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan
               had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that, <span class="note3">test of a note</span> instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose.
               The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones
               are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas
               carol: but at the first sound of 
               <div class="q1">
                  <div class="l">God bless you, merry gentleman! </div>
                  <div class="l">May nothing you dismay! </div>
               </div> Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action<span class="pb">17 </span> that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial
               frost.
