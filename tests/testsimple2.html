         <div class="p">Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl, TEI @ Oxford. </div> 
         <div class="p">EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
            publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
            image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
            (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually
            the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473
            and 1700 available in EEBO.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
            restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions
            (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based
            on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
         </div> 
         <div class="p">The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
            Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015.
            Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully
            request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
            assumptions that can be made about the data.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL).
            If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works
            are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of
            subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general,
            first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number
            of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second
            or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding.
            Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan.
            5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy
            and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone.
            After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked
            as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text.
            Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should
            make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will
            remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear
            in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a
            TCP editor.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
            TEI in Libraries guidelines.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
            mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented
            either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters
            represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
