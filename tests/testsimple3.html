         <div class="p">Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl, TEI @ Oxford. </div> 
         <div class="p">EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
            publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
            image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
            (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually
            the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473
            and 1700 available in EEBO.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
            restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions
            (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based
            on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
         </div> 
         <div class="p">The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
            Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015.
            Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully
            request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
            assumptions that can be made about the data.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL).
            If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works
            are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of
            subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general,
            first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number
            of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second
            or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding.
            Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan.
            5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy
            and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone.
            After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked
            as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text.
            Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should
            make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will
            remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear
            in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a
            TCP editor.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
            TEI in Libraries guidelines.
         </div> 
         <div class="p">Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
            mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented
            either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters
            represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                  beyond the bounds of my intent, but of this no more. I will now come to the postures
                  of the Musket and Pike: which, I conceive, are fittest to begin from the ta
                  <div class="g"></div>king up of their Armes, and arming the Souldiers concluding them with the laying down
                  of their Armes, or disarming them. But before I begin the Postures: Mee thinks I heare
                  some already inqui
                  <div class="g"></div>ring what is a Posture. Wherefore that I may sa
                  <div class="g"></div>tisfie them, and not be troublesome to others. In briefe thus.
               </div> 
               <div class="p">Posture in a Souldier is the garbe or figure, that he useth in the handling of his
                  Armes, consisting of severall Motions for atchieving of each Po
                  <div class="g"></div>sture. The Motion being the working part, the Posture the alteration or act, either
                  in circum
                  <div class="g"></div>stance or matter. As to rest your Musket being one Posture, to shoulder your Musket
                  another, so likewise for the rest, howbeit some perchance will 
                  <div class="pb"></div> object, (as formerly hath bin to one of

                  yet I have known them not only questioned, but written a
                  <div class="g"></div>gainst, peremptorily concluding that there are but three Postures to be used for the
                  Musket, whose errours I shal easily confute. But more of this after the Postures of
                  the Musket. Wherefore for the more orderly proceeding conceive their Armes to lie
                  before them on the ground, and then the first command will be, to stand to their Armes.

               <div class="p">
                  <div class="simple_dropcap">I</div> Shall now endevour to give some reasons for these severall places of dignitie in Ranke
                  and File. And first for that Geometricall propor
                  <div class="g"></div>tion gives both life and being to 
                  <div class="pb"></div> orderly discipline, consider that all parts of the body ought to be answerable. Wherefore
                  seeing that the joyning of Files and Rankes produceth greater Bodies; it is necessary
                  that a true proporti
                  <div class="g"></div>on should be kept from the beginning: and that in drawing forth of Files they observe
                  to make the Reere halfe files answerable in skill and worth to the Front halfe file.
                  And that the file-leaders, and halfe-rankes of the left flanke, should be equiva
                  <div class="g"></div>lent in worth, skill, and valour to the right flanke, that the Reere division hold
                  like proportion with the Front division, and that all parts of the body 
                  <div class="figure">
                     <div class="figDesc">depiction of 'ranks and files'</div>
                  </div> be ballanced with true proportion, so neere as the knowledge of the Souldi
                  <div class="g"></div>ers, and the number of the men will give you leave; and that there may be correspondency
                  in their worth, place, and dignity
                  <div class="g">▪</div> you may observe by ad
                  <div class="g"></div>ding the figures of number together, which are in the Margent, where you shal finde
                  that the dignity being added together of the Front halfe file, makes the number of
                  18. And the worth of the Reere division being in like man
                  <div class="g"></div>ner added, makes the like number. So likewise shal you finde the dignity and worth
                  of the File leaders of the left flanke, to paralell the worth of those on the right
                  flanke by the same rule. If you will have it yet more cleere, observe that the file
                  leader is the chiefe in his File, the bringer up the second, the halfe File leader
                  the third, the 
                  <div class="pb"></div> last man of the front halfe file the fourth. Now note that as the worth of the first
                  precedes the se
                  <div class="g"></div>cond, so the worth of the third exceeds the fourth. Now adde the first worth to the
                  fourth worth, and that makes five. And the second worth to the third, and it makes
                  the same number; so that there is equalitie throughout the Battell both in Front,
                  Reere, and Flankes: for it were unreasonable, that all the chiefe men should be on
                  the right Flanke, and all the worst on the left. For the left must be opposed to the
                  enemies right. The File leader ought to be worthiest, because he hath the com
                  <div class="g"></div>mand of his File, and marcheth the first against his enemy. The bringer up ought to
                  be the second, because his place of march is in the Reere, and is in most danger,
                  should the enemy charge on that part. The halfe file leader is the third in honour,
                  because that when the halfe file is taken off upon any occasion, he is the leader
                  (unlesse they be commanded to face about) the last man of the front halfe file is
                  the fourth man in dignitie, for when the Reere division is taken off, then he is the
                  Bringer up. The next man to the file-leader hath the fift place of honour, for that
                  one doubling brings him into the front. The next man before the Bringer-up hath the
                  sixt place of honour, for that if the body be faced about, one doubling brings him
                  into the Front accidentall, or keeping the proper front by once doubling of rankes,
                  he becomes Bringer-up to his File-leader. The se
                  <div class="g"></div>venth place of honour is his that marcheth next after the halfe-file leader, for that
                  when the halfe 
                  <div class="pb"></div> files double the Front, or marcheth forth, then one doubling, ranks him even with
                  the Front. The eight and last place of honour, is his that is the third from the Front,
                  the File being but 8. deepe, which may also be made a File-leader, though with more
                  trouble than the rest: for by counter-marching Front and Reere into the middest, and
                  then facing to the former front, &amp; after doubling of ranks, makes him likewise a file-leader.
                  Now as every mans dignitie is more or lesse in his File, so is all his ranke with
                  him. Wherefore this that hath already beene said, may suffice to demon
                  <div class="g"></div>strate unto those which as yet are ignorant of the severall places of dignity, both
                  in Ranke and File. I might have enforced many other reasons con
                  <div class="g"></div>cerning the dignity of number and place: but I have insisted longer upon this subject,
                  then at first I intended, which makes me the more willing, though somewhat abruptly
                  to breake from it, and come to shew the manner of joyning or draw
                  <div class="g"></div>ing up of Files into forme of battell. And there
                  <div class="g"></div>fore this may serve for all, the Serjeant that hath order to place them, is to lead
                  them up according to their worth and honour. As first the right hand file; then the
                  left hand file; and so the other files successively within them according to their
                  seve
                  <div class="g"></div>rall worths and places. As by the following figure you may more plainely perceive.

                  (me thinkes like some of our little-knowing souldiers of the trained Bands) they already
                  begin to be ambitious of File-lea
                  <div class="g"></div>ders places; therefore that their owne weakenes
                  <div class="g"></div>ses may light them to reade their owne follies, we will see how they will behave themselves
                  in exer
                  <div class="g"></div>cise amongst the Companie. Wherein the first thing we are to instruct them in, is
                  their distances. But because it is held by some a matter disputable, whether distance
                  be one of the motions or no: We will first declare what is distance. To which I answer,
                  that indeed Distance it selfe is no motion, but there is motion in producing such
                  distance; for Distance is the space of ground between man and man, either in File
                  or Ranke, having relation one
                  <div class="g"></div>ly to the place between each partie. All the rest of the motions having not onely
                  relation to the one, but the other. Wherefore not to spend more time in a matter so
                  apparant, we will say that the disci
                  <div class="g"></div>pline of a foot-companie consists chiefly in di
                  <div class="g"></div>stance and motion. And therefore seeing that 
                  <div class="pb"></div> distance is the ground of motion, and that no mo
                  <div class="g"></div>tion can be performed without distance, wee will leave to discourse it, and fall to
                  the matter it selfe, and shew how many sorts of Distance is ordinari
                  <div class="g"></div>ly used in our moderne discipline, which are these foure here under named,

                  twelve foot, and so of other distances. But the best received opinions hold them to

                  <div class="simple_dropcap">B</div>Efore we come to shew the varietie of 
                  <div class="hi">Facings</div> in the action, I thinke it will not be amisse to speake a word or two in the way of
                  definition: and therefore what is 
                  <div class="hi">Facing
                     <div class="g">▪</div>
                  </div> To which I answer, That 
                  <div class="hi">Facing</div> is a particular turning of the Aspect from one part to another, whereby the Front
                  proper becomes a Front accidentall: And a Front accidentall, may be reduced to his
                  proper Front. There are some likewise that by no meanes will allow of the word Face:
                  Concluding it alto
                  <div class="g"></div>gether unnecessarie; And no other word must be given, but, To the Right, To the left,
                  &amp;c. Yet I wonder that men will stumble at so small a straw, which cannot chuse but
                  be better used than refu
                  <div class="g"></div>sed. For the word Face is but one syllable, and quickly pronounced, and gives so cleare
                  an expres
                  <div class="g"></div>sion of the intent of the Commander that it con
                  <div class="g"></div>cludes it necessary. As for example, Should you command a Company to double Rankes
                  to the Right, and then command them as they were, and then say, To the Left, it might
                  puzzle a good Soul
                  <div class="g"></div>dier at the first, to discerne whether he should face 
                  <div class="pb"></div> or double: The like mistake might bee among Countermarches: Wherefore I conceive that
                  none can justly taxe it for superfluous, seeing the easiest expression hath alwayes
                  beene accounted for the best. Yet spare me, for my intent is not to over
                  <div class="g"></div>sway any man in his opinion, but rather to deliver mine; leaving all men freely to
                  their owne likings.

                  <div class="hi">Idea</div> of any ordinary Facing in his minde. Wherefore I will but shew one or two of the hardest.

                  <div class="g"></div>reth from the other doubling of ranks, first done, both in quantity and quality. In
                  quantity it diffe
                  <div class="g"></div>reth, in regard the other leaves a large distance betweene Ranke and Ranke, being
                  double the di
                  <div class="g"></div>stance they formerly stood at: this contrariwise continuing and preserving the same
                  distance they formerly stood at betweene each Ranke. In quali
                  <div class="g"></div>ty it also differeth, in regard that it brings the best and second sort of Souldiers,
                  together into the Front. The manner of this doubling you may 
                  <div class="pb"></div> plainely perceive by the figure, where it is perfor
                  <div class="g"></div>med as followeth. The eight or last ranke, which are the bringers up, passe forwards
                  even in ranke, through or betweene the intervales, to the right of them that stand
                  before them, until they come even in ranke with the Front; The seventh rank follow
                  <div class="g"></div>ing those which marched from behinde them, placing themselves in the second Rank,
                  the sixth in the third, the fifth ranke or halfe file in the fourth or reere of the
                  front halfe file. This dou
                  <div class="g"></div>bling maketh a very able Front, in bringing all the best Souldiers together. And although
                  it hath di
                  <div class="g"></div>minished the number, in regard of the depth, yet it hath doubled the number in the
                  length. This doubling is in quantity of number, not of ground. When you march into
                  your places, remember this, that the Rank which last tooke his place in the execution
                  of this motion, must first march into his place in the way of reducement. For as they
                  are led forth by their Bringers up, contrariwise they are led off by their halfe file
                  leaders.

               <div class="p">In the doubling of the Front to the left by Brin

                  the left flanke to the left. As you may plainely per
                  <div class="g"></div>ceive by the following Figure.

                  it weakneth the Inward part, where it taketh two Files cleane away, leaving a large
                  Interuale in the midst. Some say it is good when a Commander will grace any, to bring
                  them through the center or midst of the Battalia. But you must note, if you have an
                  odde File you cannot so punctually performe it, as when the number of your Files be
                  even. The manner of the doubling, you may perceive by the Figure; The motion, by the
                  little lines drawen from the Pricks. The performance is as followeth.

                  double into the third; The sixt into the fift, and so likewise for the rest.
               </div> 
               <div class="p">If you would double Files to the right and left inward, it is to be done the contrary
                  way: For whereas in this Figure of doubling last performed; the outmost Files stand,
                  the other doubling out
                  <div class="g"></div>ward into them: Contrarywise the two inmost Files should stand, the rest doubling
                  to them in

                  other part; The other part Contra would bee closest in that part. Some men doe not
                  approove of either of these doublings. I leave every man to his owne choice. The practise

                  Reere was 4/7 worse then the Front: This doubling by Halfe-files brings the best and
                  the third together into the Front, and leaves the second and fourth in the Reere:
                  So that the Front is made more able, then the Reere, by ⅓. It differeth likewise in
                  Motion thus; For whereas in the other doubling, by Bringers up, the Motion was be

                  <div class="g">▪</div> every Ranke following the Ranke which came from behind him: This contrary
                  <div class="g"></div>wise is directly led foorth by the fift Ranke from the Front, (if they be but eight
                  deepe) and so is executed more surely and suddenly; the fift Ranke passing in
                  <div class="g"></div>to the first; the sixth Ranke into the second; the se
                  <div class="g"></div>venth into the third, and so for the rest. For the re

                  their places; Then as the Motion was led on by the Halfe-file-leaders, so in the reducement,
                  they are led off by the Bringers up: Doubling of halfe-files to the left produceth
                  the same effect; onely the contrary hand.

                  being led by the Halfe-file-leaders to the Reere, which are those that hold the fourth

                  then the whole body is to face about to the Reere, being the part to be doubled: If

                  and Place; The right Flanke being wholly inserted, into the left Flanke, as you may
                  perceive by the 
                  <div class="pb"></div> Figure; The Motion is to be performed on this manner: The halfe-rankes of the Right,
                  Face to the Right, and then Even in ranke together, Coun
                  <div class="g"></div>termarch betweene the Intervales, untill the out

                  doubling is, to strengthen one of the Flankes, by bringing more hands, to doe present
                  execution; the other Flanke being in more surety. The way for the Reduce
                  <div class="g"></div>ment of this Motion is, after this manner; The halfe-ranks last doubled, being faced
                  to the Right, then they which were the last, which tooke their places in the Motion,
                  now are the first, which take their places in the Reducement; orderly marching in
                  Ranke together, untill they come to their places: Then facing to their Leader, they
                  become Files againe. The left flanke may in like manner, double the Right by Countermarch;
                  The difference is this: The right Flanke stands, the left Flanke is inserted into
                  the Right, as before the Right was into the Left. To shew another Figure for it, would

                  <div class="g"></div>ked with Muskettiers: then it would produce a mixture of Armes. To avoid which, before
                  you enter upon this doubling, of passing in, through or betweene your halfe rankes;
                  Cause your halfe files to double the Front to the right intire, which being performed,
                  you may then proceed to the doubling of your flanks, any way without mixture of Armes.
                  If I should have shewen this motion with Pikes or Muskettiers alone, this first dou

                  be a doubling of halfe files to the right intire, whereby the next dou
                  <div class="g"></div>bling may be the more commodiously accompli

               <div class="figure"></div> 
               <div class="p">This doubling of halfe files to the right intire, I have fully exprest in the figure,
                  as the body stands, the motion being ended: because we are to adde another doubling,
                  before wee reduce them. This figure next following, will be best shewen in 
                  <div class="pb"></div> the motion or action, not fully performed: that thereby the manner may be the more
                  easily dis

                  <div class="g"></div>bling of halfe files, is a doubling both of number and place; for the length of the
                  Battalia is not on
                  <div class="g"></div>ly double so many a breast as they were before, but they also have extended ther length
                  to dou
                  <div class="g"></div>ble their proportion of ground, which formerly they did occupie. I forbeare to speake
                  more of this doubling, untill we come to shew it in motion: and now proceed to the
                  next doubling upon this. The command is as followeth.

                  <div class="pb"></div> This doubling of halfe rankes is a more speedy and sure doubling, then the doubling
                  of halfe ranks by countermarch, but is most commonly used when the body consists but
                  of one sort of Armes, being either all Muskettiers, or all Pikes. But because in my
                  figures I have as well Musket
                  <div class="g"></div>tiers as Pikes, I have made use of a Doubling in
                  <div class="g"></div>tire, and from that have doubled my left flanke, to prevent the mixture of Armes:
                  However mixture of Armes upon some occasion may be necessary. The manner to performe
                  the motion, is this. The left flanke stands, the halfe ranks of the right, face to
                  the left; and then the inmost file of the right flanke, (all the files of the right
                  flanke, being by this facing become ranks) is the leader of this mo
                  <div class="g"></div>tion, marching forth right to their left hands, be
                  <div class="g"></div>tween the intervales of the rankes of the left flank, untill that the sixteenth file
                  which now is become a ranke, have placed themselves orderly in the two and thirtieth
                  file, (which is the outmost file of the left flanke.) The fifteenth in the one and
                  thirtieth, the fourteenth in the thirtieth: the thirteenth in the nine and twentieth;
                  and so likewise of all the rest. The places may be per
                  <div class="g"></div>ceived by the figure. The doubling is of number, and not of place. For reducement
                  to both these doublings, first cause the halfe rankes which last doubled, to face
                  to the right, and so to march into their places. They that last tooke their places
                  in the motion, are the first that take their places in the reducement. The doubling
                  of halfe ranks be

                  I will now shew intire doublings, as they are in action: and first beginne with doubling
                  halfe-files. The Figure followeth.

               <div class="figure"></div> 
               <div class="p">This doubling of halfe-files intire, hath beene held a better doubling; then either
                  the ordinary doubling of Ranks, or the usuall way of doubling by halfe-files or Bringers
                  up: some of the causes are these. First it makes no disturbance to the o
                  <div class="g"></div>ther part of the Battalia; but that it may either be executed in time of motion, exercise,
                  or skirmish. Secondly, it appeares another solid body, to the 
                  <div class="pb"></div> great disheartening of any enemy. Thirdly, it is very apt for over-fronting; being
                  a doubling both of number and place. The way to performe the motion, is this. The
                  halfe-files face to the left, and march till they are quite cleere of that part of
                  the body, which stands; then they face to their Lea
                  <div class="g"></div>der, and so march up, untill they are become e
                  <div class="g"></div>ven in ranke with those which stand upon the right flanke: and then the Figure will
                  be perfect. For the reducement; the word of command is, 
                  <div class="hi">Halfe Files face about to the right, march forth into your places:</div> having faced about, they march straight forth, untill they be cleere of the front
                  halfe-files; then they face to the left, and march straight forth, untill every man
                  hath his right place, and then face right after their Leaders. The doubling of halfe-files
                  to the right intire, is performed af
                  <div class="g"></div>ter the same manner, onely differing in the hand.

                  But because that it is necessary to shew one, let the halfe files face about to the

                  <div class="pb"></div> For the manner or way of this Motion, it may be thus performed: The Front halfe-files
                  Face to the Right, and Left, and march untill they are cleere of the other halfe-files
                  of the Reere; Then they Face to the Reere, and March on, untill they have attained
                  to bee Even in Ranke with them, whom they had Command to Double; which perfects the
                  Doubling. The way to Reduce them, is as followeth: If you keepe your place of the
                  first Front, Then let your Halfe-files
                  <div class="g">▪</div> Face about, (according to former directions,) and March un
                  <div class="g"></div>till they are cleere of the Reere Halfe-files, which stand; Then Face to the Right
                  and Left inward, and close their Divisions; And being Eaced all to their Leader, they
                  are Reduced. Sundry, and di
                  <div class="g"></div>vers ways there are, for Reducement both of this and most other Figures. Neuerthelesse
                  I conceive, if I give one Reducement to each Figure, it may suffice to those that
                  know little; As for such which know better, they know more wayes to the Wood then
                  one: And surely, should I inlarge my selfe, but halfe so much as I might, (and indeed
                  in some things, no more then were needfull) I should then bring my Volume into too
                  great a Bulke, and by the price, hinder some of the profit: But I am wil
                  <div class="g"></div>lingly silent in some things, whereby others may be the better encouraged by my weaknesses,
                  to take notice of their owne worths, which may in

                  he will not expect that I should inlarge my selfe so amply, as I might, upon every
                  part. For then my booke would grow be
                  <div class="g"></div>yond his bounds, and I beyond my promise; but lest I be taxed for digression, this
                  that hath alrea
                  <div class="g"></div>dy beene shewne, may suffice for 
                  <div class="hi">Conversion.</div> But because it may be expected, that I should shew 
                  <div class="hi">Conversion</div> in Figure, as well as the other Motions, therefore to gratifie such, I shall demonstrate
                  two 
                  <div class="pb"></div> Figures unto them: which may serve for all the rest. The one shall be of

                  <div class="pb"></div> This foregoing 
                  <div class="hi">figure</div> of 
                  <div class="hi">Conversion,</div> is of 
                  <div class="hi">Rankes, wheeling to the right and left,</div> or 
                  <div class="hi">ranks ranking to each flanke by wheeling.</div> It differeth from 
                  <div class="hi">ranks filing,</div> both in manner and matter. In the manner thus, Whereas in 
                  <div class="hi">ranks filing</div> to the right and left; the 
                  <div class="hi">right</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">left-hand file-leaders,</div> preserve and conti
                  <div class="g"></div>nue their places; and with that, their honours. In this 
                  <div class="hi">wheeling by Conversion to the right and left,</div> con
                  <div class="g"></div>trariwise: the 
                  <div class="hi">innermost file-leaders,</div> become the 
                  <div class="hi">outmost</div> men in that pure where the 
                  <div class="hi">front</div> stood; the other 
                  <div class="hi">file-leaders ranking even</div> within them. Some men have called this, 
                  <div class="hi">Rankes, filing by Conversion, to the right and left,</div> but corruptly. For 
                  <div class="hi">conversion</div> alwaies produceth 
                  <div class="hi">rankes,</div> as I formerly said: and 
                  <div class="hi">inversion, files.</div> But their mistake groweth from this, that when 
                  <div class="hi">rankes wheele to the right,</div> or 
                  <div class="hi">right</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">left,</div> then (say they) they by 
                  <div class="hi">wheeling,</div> become 
                  <div class="hi">file,</div> or 
                  <div class="hi">files,</div> which is a palpable 
                  <div class="hi">mistake.</div> For when we have any 
                  <div class="hi">command</div> for 
                  <div class="hi">wheeling,</div> it is a 
                  <div class="hi">maxime</div> for us, to 
                  <div class="hi">wheele our aspects unto the hand or part na
                     <div class="g"></div>med.
                  </div> By which doing, we either become ranke, or rankes: and not files, as some have sought
                  former
                  <div class="g"></div>ly to maintaine. One use, among many, for this 
                  <div class="hi">motion</div> is. It is the speediest way for a great 
                  <div class="hi">body</div> (if they have their due distance) to 
                  <div class="hi">give fire to one, or both flanks,</div> that as yet I know of. The way to performe this 
                  <div class="hi">motion,</div> is as followeth. The 
                  <div class="hi">right</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">left-hand-men,</div> of every 
                  <div class="hi">ranke,</div> became the 
                  <div class="hi">Hindges</div> of the 
                  <div class="hi">motion:</div> the rest of each ranke, 
                  <div class="hi">whee
                     <div class="g"></div>ling by equall division,
                  </div> to the right and left about, and above their right and left-hand Leaders, untill they
                  become ranks to the flanks. As you may per
                  <div class="g"></div>ceive 
                  <div class="pb"></div> by the Figure, where the 
                  <div class="hi">pricks</div> denote unto you, the

                  </div> the

                  <div class="hi">way</div> of their 
                  <div class="hi">mo

                  </div> themselves being converted into two ranks, sheweth the motion executed. I have onely 
                  <div class="hi">conver
                     <div class="g"></div>ted
                  </div> three of the rankes; for it would have taken too much roome, to have 
                  <div class="hi">wheeled</div> all the 
                  <div class="hi">ranks.</div> And it is easie by this that is shewne, to conceive the rest. If you would avoid 
                  <div class="hi">mixture of Armes,</div> then place all your 
                  <div class="hi">Muskettiers,</div> either in

               <div class="p">The easiest way for the

                     <div class="g"></div>nions.
                  </div> But if I should stand to shew their many and severall reasons, I might well be thought
                  to be without reason my selfe. My opinion is; That taking the ground before the 
                  <div class="hi">Front,</div> is gaining ground: and that to leave the ground we stood on, to take the ground next
                  behind the 
                  <div class="hi">Reere,</div> is losse of ground: And yet to take either, whereby there is advantage gotten, must
                  needs be gaining. But where the matter it selfe is so indifferent, it were fondnesse
                  to spend longer time about it. Where
                  <div class="g"></div>fore note, That 
                  <div class="hi">Countermarches</div> were of ancient use amongst the Greekes many hundred of yeeres since, &amp; from them
                  learned and practised, by many other 
                  <div class="hi">Nations;</div> and so still continued unto this day. But as the 
                  <div class="hi">Snow-ball</div> by much rowling, becomes the greater: So, in like manner, these 
                  <div class="hi">Counter-marches</div> have received 
                  <div class="hi">addition</div> in all ages. So that the three originall ones are now become more then thirty accounting
                  those 
                  <div class="hi">divisionall.</div> And yet are all of them fathered upon one or other, of the three kinds. Though some
                  of them will scarcely be owned or acknowledged; as you shall perceive, when I come
                  to shew them in their severall places. But amongst all the 
                  <div class="hi">Motions,</div> this might be the best spared: as being least 
                  <div class="hi">beneficiall,</div> to this our

                     are disreputed, and accounted of no use, because the Souldier wanting skill, cannot

                     yet they will not sticke, to carpe at such, as shall shew more, than they, concluding
                     such things for superfluous, and improper, which they themselues do not rightly understand:

                  beyond the bounds of my intent, but of this no more. I will now come to the postures
                  of the Musket and Pike: which, I conceive, are fittest to begin from the ta
                  <div class="g"></div>king up of their Armes, and arming the Souldiers concluding them with the laying down
                  of their Armes, or disarming them. But before I begin the Postures: Mee thinks I heare
                  some already inqui
                  <div class="g"></div>ring what is a Posture. Wherefore that I may sa
                  <div class="g"></div>tisfie them, and not be troublesome to others. In briefe thus.
               </div> 
               <div class="p">Posture in a Souldier is the garbe or figure, that he useth in the handling of his
                  Armes, consisting of severall Motions for atchieving of each Po
                  <div class="g"></div>sture. The Motion being the working part, the Posture the alteration or act, either
                  in circum
                  <div class="g"></div>stance or matter. As to rest your Musket being one Posture, to shoulder your Musket
                  another, so likewise for the rest, howbeit some perchance will 
                  <div class="pb"></div> object, (as formerly hath bin to one of

                  yet I have known them not only questioned, but written a
                  <div class="g"></div>gainst, peremptorily concluding that there are but three Postures to be used for the
                  Musket, whose errours I shal easily confute. But more of this after the Postures of
                  the Musket. Wherefore for the more orderly proceeding conceive their Armes to lie
                  before them on the ground, and then the first command will be, to stand to their Armes.

                     Sentinell but comes ready charged: So if any occasion happen that he must give fire
                     in the time of his standing Sentinel, it causeth a generall Alarme. So that he will
                     have no fit time to make ready upon his Rest: Where

                     me leave to answer some, which out of a Criticall humour will al
                     <div class="g"></div>wayes be carping at others, condemning these Postures, saying, There are more by halfe,
                     then are either good or usefull; and that there are no more Postures to be used, but
                     Make ready, Present, Give fire. The which wee will not deny that in Service there
                     are any other usefull: notwithstand
                     <div class="g"></div>ing I would have them to know, that Make ready is no Posture, but a word of Command,
                     including all Postures, from the first Arming of the Soul
                     <div class="g"></div>dier to the present: or if the Muskettier be char
                     <div class="g"></div>ged, shouldered or both, then the word (Make ready) commands the prosecution of the
                     rest of your Postures which are between the Posture

                     first it is most necessary to instruct them punctually, from Posture to Posture: Which
                     being once attained, he manageth his Armes more surely more come
                     <div class="g"></div>ly, with more celerity, and with better execution: and at the first may as easily
                     be taught the best way. But if he have got an habit of doing ill there wil be as much
                     or more pains spent in reclayming his errours, as at first to teach him the best,
                     safest, and readiest way.

               <div class="p">
                  <div class="simple_dropcap">I</div> Shall now endevour to give some reasons for these severall places of dignitie in Ranke
                  and File. And first for that Geometricall propor
                  <div class="g"></div>tion gives both life and being to 
                  <div class="pb"></div> orderly discipline, consider that all parts of the body ought to be answerable. Wherefore
                  seeing that the joyning of Files and Rankes produceth greater Bodies; it is necessary
                  that a true proporti
                  <div class="g"></div>on should be kept from the beginning: and that in drawing forth of Files they observe
                  to make the Reere halfe files answerable in skill and worth to the Front halfe file.
                  And that the file-leaders, and halfe-rankes of the left flanke, should be equiva
                  <div class="g"></div>lent in worth, skill, and valour to the right flanke, that the Reere division hold
                  like proportion with the Front division, and that all parts of the body 
                  <div class="figure">
                     <div class="figDesc">depiction of 'ranks and files'</div>
                  </div> be ballanced with true proportion, so neere as the knowledge of the Souldi
                  <div class="g"></div>ers, and the number of the men will give you leave; and that there may be correspondency
                  in their worth, place, and dignity
                  <div class="g">▪</div> you may observe by ad
                  <div class="g"></div>ding the figures of number together, which are in the Margent, where you shal finde
                  that the dignity being added together of the Front halfe file, makes the number of
                  18. And the worth of the Reere division being in like man
                  <div class="g"></div>ner added, makes the like number. So likewise shal you finde the dignity and worth
                  of the File leaders of the left flanke, to paralell the worth of those on the right
                  flanke by the same rule. If you will have it yet more cleere, observe that the file
                  leader is the chiefe in his File, the bringer up the second, the halfe File leader
                  the third, the 
                  <div class="pb"></div> last man of the front halfe file the fourth. Now note that as the worth of the first
                  precedes the se
                  <div class="g"></div>cond, so the worth of the third exceeds the fourth. Now adde the first worth to the
                  fourth worth, and that makes five. And the second worth to the third, and it makes
                  the same number; so that there is equalitie throughout the Battell both in Front,
                  Reere, and Flankes: for it were unreasonable, that all the chiefe men should be on
                  the right Flanke, and all the worst on the left. For the left must be opposed to the
                  enemies right. The File leader ought to be worthiest, because he hath the com
                  <div class="g"></div>mand of his File, and marcheth the first against his enemy. The bringer up ought to
                  be the second, because his place of march is in the Reere, and is in most danger,
                  should the enemy charge on that part. The halfe file leader is the third in honour,
                  because that when the halfe file is taken off upon any occasion, he is the leader
                  (unlesse they be commanded to face about) the last man of the front halfe file is
                  the fourth man in dignitie, for when the Reere division is taken off, then he is the
                  Bringer up. The next man to the file-leader hath the fift place of honour, for that
                  one doubling brings him into the front. The next man before the Bringer-up hath the
                  sixt place of honour, for that if the body be faced about, one doubling brings him
                  into the Front accidentall, or keeping the proper front by once doubling of rankes,
                  he becomes Bringer-up to his File-leader. The se
                  <div class="g"></div>venth place of honour is his that marcheth next after the halfe-file leader, for that
                  when the halfe 
                  <div class="pb"></div> files double the Front, or marcheth forth, then one doubling, ranks him even with
                  the Front. The eight and last place of honour, is his that is the third from the Front,
                  the File being but 8. deepe, which may also be made a File-leader, though with more
                  trouble than the rest: for by counter-marching Front and Reere into the middest, and
                  then facing to the former front, &amp; after doubling of ranks, makes him likewise a file-leader.
                  Now as every mans dignitie is more or lesse in his File, so is all his ranke with
                  him. Wherefore this that hath already beene said, may suffice to demon
                  <div class="g"></div>strate unto those which as yet are ignorant of the severall places of dignity, both
                  in Ranke and File. I might have enforced many other reasons con
                  <div class="g"></div>cerning the dignity of number and place: but I have insisted longer upon this subject,
                  then at first I intended, which makes me the more willing, though somewhat abruptly
                  to breake from it, and come to shew the manner of joyning or draw
                  <div class="g"></div>ing up of Files into forme of battell. And there
                  <div class="g"></div>fore this may serve for all, the Serjeant that hath order to place them, is to lead
                  them up according to their worth and honour. As first the right hand file; then the
                  left hand file; and so the other files successively within them according to their
                  seve
                  <div class="g"></div>rall worths and places. As by the following figure you may more plainely perceive.

                  <div class="simple_dropcap">N</div>Ow that our Souldiers have attained some small knowledge in the use of their Armes
                  (me thinkes like some of our little-knowing souldiers of the trained Bands) they already
                  begin to be ambitious of File-lea
                  <div class="g"></div>ders places; therefore that their owne weakenes
                  <div class="g"></div>ses may light them to reade their owne follies, we will see how they will behave themselves
                  in exer
                  <div class="g"></div>cise amongst the Companie. Wherein the first thing we are to instruct them in, is
                  their distances. But because it is held by some a matter disputable, whether distance
                  be one of the motions or no: We will first declare what is distance. To which I answer,
                  that indeed Distance it selfe is no motion, but there is motion in producing such
                  distance; for Distance is the space of ground between man and man, either in File
                  or Ranke, having relation one
                  <div class="g"></div>ly to the place between each partie. All the rest of the motions having not onely
                  relation to the one, but the other. Wherefore not to spend more time in a matter so
                  apparant, we will say that the disci
                  <div class="g"></div>pline of a foot-companie consists chiefly in di
                  <div class="g"></div>stance and motion. And therefore seeing that 
                  <div class="pb"></div> distance is the ground of motion, and that no mo
                  <div class="g"></div>tion can be performed without distance, wee will leave to discourse it, and fall to
                  the matter it selfe, and shew how many sorts of Distance is ordinari

                  <div class="simple_dropcap">B</div>Efore we come to shew the varietie of 
                  <div class="hi">Facings</div> in the action, I thinke it will not be amisse to speake a word or two in the way of
                  definition: and therefore what is 
                  <div class="hi">Facing
                     <div class="g">▪</div>
                  </div> To which I answer, That 
                  <div class="hi">Facing</div> is a particular turning of the Aspect from one part to another, whereby the Front
                  proper becomes a Front accidentall: And a Front accidentall, may be reduced to his
                  proper Front. There are some likewise that by no meanes will allow of the word Face:
                  Concluding it alto
                  <div class="g"></div>gether unnecessarie; And no other word must be given, but, To the Right, To the left,
                  &amp;c. Yet I wonder that men will stumble at so small a straw, which cannot chuse but
                  be better used than refu
                  <div class="g"></div>sed. For the word Face is but one syllable, and quickly pronounced, and gives so cleare
                  an expres
                  <div class="g"></div>sion of the intent of the Commander that it con
                  <div class="g"></div>cludes it necessary. As for example, Should you command a Company to double Rankes
                  to the Right, and then command them as they were, and then say, To the Left, it might
                  puzzle a good Soul
                  <div class="g"></div>dier at the first, to discerne whether he should face 
                  <div class="pb"></div> or double: The like mistake might bee among Countermarches: Wherefore I conceive that
                  none can justly taxe it for superfluous, seeing the easiest expression hath alwayes
                  beene accounted for the best. Yet spare me, for my intent is not to over
                  <div class="g"></div>sway any man in his opinion, but rather to deliver mine; leaving all men freely to
                  their owne likings.

                  every man that knows any thing, may easily conceive the 
                  <div class="hi">Idea</div> of any ordinary Facing in his minde. Wherefore I will but shew one or two of the hardest.
                  You are to note that in the Motion of Facings every man turnes on the Center, or Ball

                  distance they formerly stood at betweene each Ranke. In quali
                  <div class="g"></div>ty it also differeth, in regard that it brings the best and second sort of Souldiers,
                  together into the Front. The manner of this doubling you may 
                  <div class="pb"></div> plainely perceive by the figure, where it is perfor
                  <div class="g"></div>med as followeth. The eight or last ranke, which are the bringers up, passe forwards
                  even in ranke, through or betweene the intervales, to the right of them that stand
                  before them, until they come even in ranke with the Front; The seventh rank follow
                  <div class="g"></div>ing those which marched from behinde them, placing themselves in the second Rank,
                  the sixth in the third, the fifth ranke or halfe file in the fourth or reere of the
                  front halfe file. This dou
                  <div class="g"></div>bling maketh a very able Front, in bringing all the best Souldiers together. And although
                  it hath di
                  <div class="g"></div>minished the number, in regard of the depth, yet it hath doubled the number in the
                  length. This doubling is in quantity of number, not of ground. When you march into
                  your places, remember this, that the Rank which last tooke his place in the execution
                  of this motion, must first march into his place in the way of reducement. For as they
                  are led forth by their Bringers up, contrariwise they are led off by their halfe file
                  leaders.

                  the left flanke to the left. As you may plainely per

                  it weakneth the Inward part, where it taketh two Files cleane away, leaving a large
                  Interuale in the midst. Some say it is good when a Commander will grace any, to bring
                  them through the center or midst of the Battalia. But you must note, if you have an
                  odde File you cannot so punctually performe it, as when the number of your Files be
                  even. The manner of the doubling, you may perceive by the Figure; The motion, by the
                  little lines drawen from the Pricks. The performance is as followeth.

               <div class="p">If you would double Files to the right and left inward, it is to be done the contrary
                  way: For whereas in this Figure of doubling last performed; the outmost Files stand,
                  the other doubling out
                  <div class="g"></div>ward into them: Contrarywise the two inmost Files should stand, the rest doubling

                  the third together into the Front, and leaves the second and fourth in the Reere:
                  So that the Front is made more able, then the Reere, by ⅓. It differeth likewise in

                  and Place; The right Flanke being wholly inserted, into the left Flanke, as you may
                  perceive by the 
                  <div class="pb"></div> Figure; The Motion is to be performed on this manner: The halfe-rankes of the Right,
                  Face to the Right, and then Even in ranke together, Coun
                  <div class="g"></div>termarch betweene the Intervales, untill the out

                  File of the left Flanke, which is marked with the number 16: The second into the fifteenth;
                  the third into the foure

                  doubling is, to strengthen one of the Flankes, by bringing more hands, to doe present
                  execution; the other Flanke being in more surety. The way for the Reduce
                  <div class="g"></div>ment of this Motion is, after this manner; The halfe-ranks last doubled, being faced
                  to the Right, then they which were the last, which tooke their places in the Motion,
                  now are the first, which take their places in the Reducement; orderly marching in
                  Ranke together, untill they come to their places: Then facing to their Leader, they
                  become Files againe. The left flanke may in like manner, double the Right by Countermarch;
                  The difference is this: The right Flanke stands, the left Flanke is inserted into
                  the Right, as before the Right was into the Left. To shew another Figure for it, would
                  be altogether needlesse.

                  <div class="g"></div>ked with Muskettiers: then it would produce a mixture of Armes. To avoid which, before
                  you enter upon this doubling, of passing in, through or betweene your halfe rankes;
                  Cause your halfe files to double the Front to the right intire, which being performed,
                  you may then proceed to the doubling of your flanks, any way without mixture of Armes.
                  If I should have shewen this motion with Pikes or Muskettiers alone, this first dou

                  <div class="g"></div>stance, and come to the prosecution of the matter: which in the first place, will
                  be a doubling of halfe files to the right intire, whereby the next dou
                  <div class="g"></div>bling may be the more commodiously accompli
                  <div class="g"></div>shed. The figure followeth.

               <div class="figure"></div> 
               <div class="p">This doubling of halfe files to the right intire, I have fully exprest in the figure,
                  as the body stands, the motion being ended: because we are to adde another doubling,
                  before wee reduce them. This figure next following, will be best shewen in 
                  <div class="pb"></div> the motion or action, not fully performed: that thereby the manner may be the more
                  easily dis
                  <div class="g"></div>cerned. But by the way observe, that this dou
                  <div class="g"></div>bling of halfe files, is a doubling both of number and place; for the length of the
                  Battalia is not on
                  <div class="g"></div>ly double so many a breast as they were before, but they also have extended ther length
                  to dou
                  <div class="g"></div>ble their proportion of ground, which formerly they did occupie. I forbeare to speake
                  more of this doubling, untill we come to shew it in motion: and now proceed to the
                  next doubling upon this. The command is as followeth.

               <div class="p">
                  <div class="pb"></div> This doubling of halfe rankes is a more speedy and sure doubling, then the doubling
                  of halfe ranks by countermarch, but is most commonly used when the body consists but
                  of one sort of Armes, being either all Muskettiers, or all Pikes. But because in my
                  figures I have as well Musket
                  <div class="g"></div>tiers as Pikes, I have made use of a Doubling in
                  <div class="g"></div>tire, and from that have doubled my left flanke, to prevent the mixture of Armes:
                  However mixture of Armes upon some occasion may be necessary. The manner to performe
                  the motion, is this. The left flanke stands, the halfe ranks of the right, face to
                  the left; and then the inmost file of the right flanke, (all the files of the right
                  flanke, being by this facing become ranks) is the leader of this mo
                  <div class="g"></div>tion, marching forth right to their left hands, be
                  <div class="g"></div>tween the intervales of the rankes of the left flank, untill that the sixteenth file
                  which now is become a ranke, have placed themselves orderly in the two and thirtieth
                  file, (which is the outmost file of the left flanke.) The fifteenth in the one and
                  thirtieth, the fourteenth in the thirtieth: the thirteenth in the nine and twentieth;
                  and so likewise of all the rest. The places may be per
                  <div class="g"></div>ceived by the figure. The doubling is of number, and not of place. For reducement
                  to both these doublings, first cause the halfe rankes which last doubled, to face
                  to the right, and so to march into their places. They that last tooke their places
                  in the motion, are the first that take their places in the reducement. The doubling
                  of halfe ranks be
                  <div class="g"></div>ing thus reduced, next for the reducing of the halfe

               <div class="p">This doubling of halfe-files intire, hath beene held a better doubling; then either
                  the ordinary doubling of Ranks, or the usuall way of doubling by halfe-files or Bringers
                  up: some of the causes are these. First it makes no disturbance to the o
                  <div class="g"></div>ther part of the Battalia; but that it may either be executed in time of motion, exercise,
                  or skirmish. Secondly, it appeares another solid body, to the 
                  <div class="pb"></div> great disheartening of any enemy. Thirdly, it is very apt for over-fronting; being
                  a doubling both of number and place. The way to performe the motion, is this. The
                  halfe-files face to the left, and march till they are quite cleere of that part of
                  the body, which stands; then they face to their Lea
                  <div class="g"></div>der, and so march up, untill they are become e
                  <div class="g"></div>ven in ranke with those which stand upon the right flanke: and then the Figure will
                  be perfect. For the reducement; the word of command is, 
                  <div class="hi">Halfe Files face about to the right, march forth into your places:</div> having faced about, they march straight forth, untill they be cleere of the front

                  hath his right place, and then face right after their Leaders. The doubling of halfe-files
                  to the right intire, is performed af
                  <div class="g"></div>ter the same manner, onely differing in the hand.

                  being opened to the Right and Left, and Faced upon the Enemy; March gallantly Vp,
                  and receive the Charge, whilest the others provide for themselves. This Motion may
                  also be usefull, when you have gained some place of aduantage, For then by this Doub

                  by the suddaine bringing of these Supplies into the Reere you may not onely relieve
                  your owne, but happily overfront your Enemy. The Figure followeth

               <div class="p">
                  <div class="pb"></div> For the manner or way of this Motion, it may be thus performed: The Front halfe-files
                  Face to the Right, and Left, and march untill they are cleere of the other halfe-files
                  of the Reere; Then they Face to the Reere, and March on, untill they have attained
                  to bee Even in Ranke with them, whom they had Command to Double; which perfects the
                  Doubling. The way to Reduce them, is as followeth: If you keepe your place of the
                  first Front, Then let your Halfe-files
                  <div class="g">▪</div> Face about, (according to former directions,) and March un
                  <div class="g"></div>till they are cleere of the Reere Halfe-files, which stand; Then Face to the Right
                  and Left inward, and close their Divisions; And being Eaced all to their Leader, they
                  are Reduced. Sundry, and di
                  <div class="g"></div>vers ways there are, for Reducement both of this and most other Figures. Neuerthelesse
                  I conceive, if I give one Reducement to each Figure, it may suffice to those that
                  know little; As for such which know better, they know more wayes to the Wood then
                  one: And surely, should I inlarge my selfe, but halfe so much as I might, (and indeed
                  in some things, no more then were needfull) I should then bring my Volume into too
                  great a Bulke, and by the price, hinder some of the profit: But I am wil
                  <div class="g"></div>lingly silent in some things, whereby others may be the better encouraged by my weaknesses,
                  to take notice of their owne worths, which may in
                  <div class="g"></div>duce them to put Pen to paper, and thereby pro
                  <div class="g"></div>duce some worthy worke, which may tend to their Credits, and their Countreys good.

                  <div class="hi">ranks filing,</div> both in manner and matter. In the manner thus, Whereas in 
                  <div class="hi">ranks filing</div> to the right and left; the

                  <div class="hi">wheeling by Conversion to the right and left,</div> con
                  <div class="g"></div>trariwise: the

                  <div class="hi">file-leaders ranking even</div> within them. Some men have called this, 
                  <div class="hi">Rankes, filing by Conversion, to the right and left,</div> but corruptly. For 
                  <div class="hi">conversion</div> alwaies produceth 
                  <div class="hi">rankes,</div> as I formerly said: and 
                  <div class="hi">inversion, files.</div> But their mistake groweth from this, that when 
                  <div class="hi">rankes wheele to the right,</div> or 
                  <div class="hi">right</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">left,</div> then (say they) they by 
                  <div class="hi">wheeling,</div> become 
                  <div class="hi">file,</div> or 
                  <div class="hi">files,</div> which is a palpable 
                  <div class="hi">mistake.</div> For when we have any 
                  <div class="hi">command</div> for 
                  <div class="hi">wheeling,</div> it is a

                     <div class="g"></div>med.
                  </div> By which doing, we either become ranke, or rankes: and not files, as some have sought
                  former
                  <div class="g"></div>ly to maintaine. One use, among many, for this

                  <div class="hi">give fire to one, or both flanks,</div> that as yet I know of. The way to performe this 
                  <div class="hi">motion,</div> is as followeth. The 
                  <div class="hi">right</div> and

                  <div class="hi">Reere,</div> it makes a semblance of flying. Some will have the 
                  <div class="hi">Lacedamonian,</div> A Counter-march of gaining of ground: because the 
                  <div class="hi">Enemy</div> appearing in the 
                  <div class="hi">Reere,</div> it makes a semblance of Charging or falling on. Others call it, A Coun
                  <div class="g"></div>termarch of losse of ground: because it looseth all 
                  <div class="pb"></div> that ground the 
                  <div class="hi">Battalia</div> stood upon; taking in stead thereof, the ground behind the 
                  <div class="hi">Reere.</div> There are others of opinion, That there are Counter-marches of losse and gaine, in
                  either of them. All these are furnished with 
                  <div class="hi">reasons,</div> to backe their

                  </div> But if I should stand to shew their many and severall reasons, I might well be thought
                  to be without reason my selfe. My opinion is; That taking the ground before the 
                  <div class="hi">Front,</div> is gaining ground: and that to leave the ground we stood on, to take the ground next
                  behind the 
                  <div class="hi">Reere,</div> is losse of ground: And yet to take either, whereby there is advantage gotten, must
                  needs be gaining. But where the matter it selfe is so indifferent, it were fondnesse
                  to spend longer time about it. Where
                  <div class="g"></div>fore note, That 
                  <div class="hi">Countermarches</div> were of ancient use amongst the Greekes many hundred of yeeres since, &amp; from them
                  learned and practised, by many other 
                  <div class="hi">Nations;</div> and so still continued unto this day. But as the 
                  <div class="hi">Snow-ball</div> by much rowling, becomes the greater: So, in like manner, these 
                  <div class="hi">Counter-marches</div> have received 
                  <div class="hi">addition</div> in all ages. So that the three originall ones are now become more then thirty accounting
                  those 
                  <div class="hi">divisionall.</div> And yet are all of them fathered upon one or other, of the three kinds. Though some
                  of them will scarcely be owned or acknowledged; as you shall perceive, when I come
                  to shew them in their severall places. But amongst all the 
                  <div class="hi">Motions,</div> this might be the best spared: as being least

                     <div class="g"></div>lesse such is the wilfull stupidity of the times, that many good, and usefull things
                     are disreputed, and accounted of no use, because the Souldier wanting skill, cannot
                     performe them, as they ought: which would the

                     <div class="hi">Motions</div> would become facile and easie. And to say truth, the grea
                     <div class="g"></div>test fault is, want of skill in those, which should give instruction to others; and
                     yet they will not sticke, to carpe at such, as shall shew more, than they, concluding
                     such things for superfluous, and improper, which they themselues do not rightly understand:

                  <div class="g"></div>ficient, to expresse the worth of the Figure) yet may the

                  </div> and the Muskettiers may give fire, two, three, or foure waies at once upon it: Yea,
                  if the

                  <div class="hi">opulent,</div> as the Figure is

                  <div class="pb"></div> might fire twelve severall wayes together. This notwithstanding, I spare to speake
                  further to what may be done; and come to shew what I intend in it. Concerning this
                  Figure, the waies to fire upon it, are ordinarily two. The first, when the Musket
                  <div class="g"></div>tiers give fire, and then place themselves in the 
                  <div class="hi">reere</div> of their 
                  <div class="hi">owne divisions</div> of Muskets. The second way is, after that they have fired, to place them in the 
                  <div class="hi">reere</div> of their Pikes: the Pikes maintaining the Muskettiers 
                  <div class="hi">ground.</div> The words of Command which produce the Figure, are as followeth.

                  the first rankes have given fire, let them

                  which fired and
