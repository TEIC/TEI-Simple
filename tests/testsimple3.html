               </h2> 
               <h2 class="head">Concerning Postures and handling Armes.</h2> 
               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">T</span>He first rudiments for the Discipline of Infantry ought to be an Instruction, for the well mannaging of their Armes; whereby they may be brought, to
                  use them with ease and delight: whereas to the contrary (without exercise) both sorts of Armes, wil become
                  a troublesom burden, unto the unskilfull Bearers. No man is borne a Souldier, neither can any attain, to be kilfull in
                  the Art Military without practice. But by practice is gained knowledge, knowledge begets courage and confidence; few or none being fearefull to execute
                  what by <span class="pb">2 @tcp:1160:15</span> frequent practice they have throughly learned.
               </p> 
               <p class="p">Wherefore it is necessary for every one that intends any proficiency in this part of the Art military, to be instructed in the Postures and well handling of their Armes; a thing much
                  to be desired in our Trained Bands, though small hope of amendment. Seeing the Souldiers are
                  scarce called forth to exercise either Posture, or Motion once in foure or five yeares. Whose
                  the fault is I know not, only I pray God that it may be ame<span class="g2">̄</span>ded, lest shame and infamy be the least of euils which our carelesse security may
                  bring upon us: Yet pardon this digression, for my zeale to my Countries good had almost transported mee
                  beyond the bounds of my intent, but of this no more. I will now come to the postures
                  of the Musket and Pike: which, I conceive, are fittest to begin from the taking up of their Armes, and arming the Souldiers concluding them with the laying down
                  of their Armes, or disarming them. But before I begin the Postures: Mee thinks I heare
                  some already inquiring what is a Posture. Wherefore that I may satisfie them, and not be troublesome to others. In briefe thus.
               </p> 
               <p class="p">Posture in a Souldier is the garbe or figure, that he useth in the handling of his
                  Armes, consisting of severall Motions for atchieving of each Posture. The Motion being the working part, the Posture the alteration or act, either
                  in circumstance or matter. As to rest your Musket being one Posture, to shoulder your Musket
                  another, so likewise for the rest, howbeit some perchance will <span class="pb">3 @tcp:1160:15</span> object, (as formerly hath bin to one of <span class="hi2">Athens,</span> making a long Oration in the praise of <span class="hi2">Hercules</span> his valour) who ever doubted of it. So to me who ever questioned these for Postures:
                  yet I have known them not only questioned, but written against, peremptorily concluding that there are but three Postures to be used for the
                  Musket, whose errours I shal easily confute. But more of this after the Postures of
                  the Musket. Wherefore for the more orderly proceeding conceive their Armes to lie
                  before them on the ground, and then the first command will be, to stand to their Armes.

                  <p class="p">There is likewise the Sentinell Posture, which is, The Muskettier having his Musket
                     charged with Bullet, his Match cockt, his Pan guarded, stands with his Musket rested
                     to performe <span class="pb">6 @tcp:1160:17</span> such duty as shall be commanded or given him in charge. Some have likewise taught
                     to make ready on, or from the Sentinell Posture: But note that as none comes to stand
                     Sentinell but comes ready charged: So if any occasion happen that he must give fire
                     in the time of his standing Sentinel, it causeth a generall Alarme. So that he will
                     have no fit time to make ready upon his Rest: Wherefore, I conceive it superfluous; but will ever conforme to better judgement.
                  </p> 
                  <p class="p">We have also the Funerall Posture, which from the Rest is to be performed at 3. Motions,
                     which cannot so well be exprest in writing, as it will expresse it selfe in Action. Wherefore seeing that it is rather an Ornament to Obsequies,
                     than truly necessary for Armies I will not spend more time about it, but come to the Postures of the Pike. Yet before I passe upon them, give
                     me leave to answer some, which out of a Criticall humour will alwayes be carping at others, condemning these Postures, saying, There are more by halfe,
                     then are either good or usefull; and that there are no more Postures to be used, but
                     Make ready, Present, Give fire. The which wee will not deny that in Service there
                     are any other usefull: notwithstanding I would have them to know, that Make ready is no Posture, but a word of Command,
                     including all Postures, from the first Arming of the Souldier to the present: or if the Muskettier be charged, shouldered or both, then the word (Make ready) commands the prosecution of the
                     rest of your Postures which are between the Posture <span class="pb">7 @tcp:1160:17</span> you then immediatly are at, when the word is given, and the other Posture, Present for which reason when wee teach Muskettiers at
                     first it is most necessary to instruct them punctually, from Posture to Posture: Which
                     being once attained, he manageth his Armes more surely more comely, with more celerity, and with better execution: and at the first may as easily
                     be taught the best way. But if he have got an habit of doing ill there wil be as much
                     or more pains spent in reclayming his errours, as at first to teach him the best,
                     safest, and readiest way.

                  or marching even a breast, or (as some write) pouldron to pouldron, or shoulder to shoulder. A File<span class="margin-left note1">What is a File.</span> is a sequence of men, standing one behinde another, backe to belly in a straight line from Front to Reere, consisting sometimes
                  of 6. 8. or 10. men. on some occasions the <span class="hi2">Spaniards</span> make them 12. deepe. But when any one would shew much variety of exercise, then 8. will be the more pliant and dividual number, yet for service
                  in the field, where men are not altogether so expert (as I could wish our Country-men
                  were) 10. men is the fittest number, not onely for the cause aforesaid, but also because that 10. is the square root of a 100. and is a better number to draw Companies
                  into grosser bodies.

               <h2 class="head">Reasons for precedency of dignity in Rankes and Files.</h2> 
               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">I</span> Shall now endevour to give some reasons for these severall places of dignitie in Ranke
                  and File. And first for that Geometricall proportion gives both life and being to <span class="pb">16 @tcp:1160:22</span> orderly discipline, consider that all parts of the body ought to be answerable. Wherefore
                  seeing that the joyning of Files and Rankes produceth greater Bodies; it is necessary
                  that a true proportion should be kept from the beginning: and that in drawing forth of Files they observe
                  to make the Reere halfe files answerable in skill and worth to the Front halfe file.
                  And that the file-leaders, and halfe-rankes of the left flanke, should be equivalent in worth, skill, and valour to the right flanke, that the Reere division hold
                  like proportion with the Front division, and that all parts of the body <span class="figure2"><span class="figDesc">depiction of 'ranks and files'</span></span> be ballanced with true proportion, so neere as the knowledge of the Souldiers, and the number of the men will give you leave; and that there may be correspondency
                  in their worth, place, and dignity<span class="g2">▪</span> you may observe by adding the figures of number together, which are in the Margent, where you shal finde
                  that the dignity being added together of the Front halfe file, makes the number of
                  18. And the worth of the Reere division being in like manner added, makes the like number. So likewise shal you finde the dignity and worth
                  of the File leaders of the left flanke, to paralell the worth of those on the right
                  flanke by the same rule. If you will have it yet more cleere, observe that the file
                  leader is the chiefe in his File, the bringer up the second, the halfe File leader
                  the third, the <span class="pb">17 @tcp:1160:22</span> last man of the front halfe file the fourth. Now note that as the worth of the first
                  precedes the second, so the worth of the third exceeds the fourth. Now adde the first worth to the
                  fourth worth, and that makes five. And the second worth to the third, and it makes
                  the same number; so that there is equalitie throughout the Battell both in Front,
                  Reere, and Flankes: for it were unreasonable, that all the chiefe men should be on
                  the right Flanke, and all the worst on the left. For the left must be opposed to the
                  enemies right. The File leader ought to be worthiest, because he hath the command of his File, and marcheth the first against his enemy. The bringer up ought to
                  be the second, because his place of march is in the Reere, and is in most danger,
                  should the enemy charge on that part. The halfe file leader is the third in honour,
                  because that when the halfe file is taken off upon any occasion, he is the leader
                  (unlesse they be commanded to face about) the last man of the front halfe file is
                  the fourth man in dignitie, for when the Reere division is taken off, then he is the
                  Bringer up. The next man to the file-leader hath the fift place of honour, for that
                  one doubling brings him into the front. The next man before the Bringer-up hath the
                  sixt place of honour, for that if the body be faced about, one doubling brings him
                  into the Front accidentall, or keeping the proper front by once doubling of rankes,
                  he becomes Bringer-up to his File-leader. The seventh place of honour is his that marcheth next after the halfe-file leader, for that
                  when the halfe <span class="pb">18 @tcp:1160:23</span> files double the Front, or marcheth forth, then one doubling, ranks him even with
                  the Front. The eight and last place of honour, is his that is the third from the Front,
                  the File being but 8. deepe, which may also be made a File-leader, though with more
                  trouble than the rest: for by counter-marching Front and Reere into the middest, and
                  then facing to the former front, &amp; after doubling of ranks, makes him likewise a file-leader.
                  Now as every mans dignitie is more or lesse in his File, so is all his ranke with
                  him. Wherefore this that hath already beene said, may suffice to demonstrate unto those which as yet are ignorant of the severall places of dignity, both
                  in Ranke and File. I might have enforced many other reasons concerning the dignity of number and place: but I have insisted longer upon this subject,
                  then at first I intended, which makes me the more willing, though somewhat abruptly
                  to breake from it, and come to shew the manner of joyning or drawing up of Files into forme of battell. And therefore this may serve for all, the Serjeant that hath order to place them, is to lead
                  them up according to their worth and honour. As first the right hand file; then the
                  left hand file; and so the other files successively within them according to their
                  severall worths and places. As by the following figure you may more plainely perceive.

                  I dare say they have been well reputed of by good Souldiers, no disparagement unto the fault-finders (if there happen to be any such.) As
                  for the noble, worthy, and well-knowing Souldiers, I am almost confident that out

               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">N</span>Ow that our Souldiers have attained some small knowledge in the use of their Armes
                  (me thinkes like some of our little-knowing souldiers of the trained Bands) they already
                  begin to be ambitious of File-leaders places; therefore that their owne weakenesses may light them to reade their owne follies, we will see how they will behave themselves
                  in exercise amongst the Companie. Wherein the first thing we are to instruct them in, is
                  their distances. But because it is held by some a matter disputable, whether distance
                  be one of the motions or no: We will first declare what is distance. To which I answer,
                  that indeed Distance it selfe is no motion, but there is motion in producing such
                  distance; for Distance is the space of ground between man and man, either in File
                  or Ranke, having relation onely to the place between each partie. All the rest of the motions having not onely
                  relation to the one, but the other. Wherefore not to spend more time in a matter so
                  apparant, we will say that the discipline of a foot-companie consists chiefly in distance and motion. And therefore seeing that <span class="pb">21 @tcp:1160:24</span> distance is the ground of motion, and that no motion can be performed without distance, wee will leave to discourse it, and fall to
                  the matter it selfe, and shew how many sorts of Distance is ordinarily used in our moderne discipline, which are these foure here under named, <span class="hi2">viz.</span></p>

                  they went both under one and the same denomination. As that order in File was three
                  foot, order in Ranke sixe foot, open order in file sixe foot, open order in ranke
                  twelve foot, and so of other distances. But the best received opinions hold them to
                  be alike both in ranke and file.

               <h2 class="head">What is Facing, and the use of the word, whether to be used or refused.</h2> 
               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">B</span>Efore we come to shew the varietie of <span class="hi2">Facings</span> in the action, I thinke it will not be amisse to speake a word or two in the way of
                  definition: and therefore what is <span class="hi2">Facing<span class="g2">▪</span></span> To which I answer, That <span class="hi2">Facing</span> is a particular turning of the Aspect from one part to another, whereby the Front
                  proper becomes a Front accidentall: And a Front accidentall, may be reduced to his
                  proper Front. There are some likewise that by no meanes will allow of the word Face:
                  Concluding it altogether unnecessarie; And no other word must be given, but, To the Right, To the left,
                  &amp;c. Yet I wonder that men will stumble at so small a straw, which cannot chuse but
                  be better used than refused. For the word Face is but one syllable, and quickly pronounced, and gives so cleare
                  an expression of the intent of the Commander that it concludes it necessary. As for example, Should you command a Company to double Rankes
                  to the Right, and then command them as they were, and then say, To the Left, it might
                  puzzle a good Souldier at the first, to discerne whether he should face <span class="pb">29 @tcp:1160:28</span> or double: The like mistake might bee among Countermarches: Wherefore I conceive that
                  none can justly taxe it for superfluous, seeing the easiest expression hath alwayes
                  beene accounted for the best. Yet spare me, for my intent is not to oversway any man in his opinion, but rather to deliver mine; leaving all men freely to
                  their owne likings.
               </p> 
               <p class="p">If my intent were to make a great booke with a little matter, I might then here insert
                  figures for every particular Facing, and their Reducements to their first Posture,
                  which would take up divers sheets of paper, and to little purpose. For I suppose that
                  every man that knows any thing, may easily conceive the <span class="hi2">Idea</span> of any ordinary Facing in his minde. Wherefore I will but shew one or two of the hardest.
                  You are to note that in the Motion of Facings every man turnes on the Center, or Ball
                  of the left foot, moving onely the right, the other being the keeper both of ranke

                  such like, when they made use of such formes of battell. But for the use of them in
                  our moderne Discipline, I conceive there is little or none, onely thus, wee honour
                  the memory of the Ancients in their use. And some say they are very fit for exercise;
                  for that by their use the souldier is made more apt and perfect in the other. Therefore

               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">D</span>Oublings are of most excellent and singular good use for the strengthening of any part of the battell, according to the occasion or discretion of the Commander, and consists of these two generals, Doublings of length, and
                  Doublings of depth, all times in quantity <span class="pb">35 @tcp:1160:31</span> of number, sometimes both in number and place, both sorts having this restriction,
                  to be doublings of rankes or flanks; every particular doublings pointing at one of these, although there be sundry and divers waies for the
                  doing of them, each of them being to very good purpose, for some consideration or
                  other. Doublings of Ranks, from what forme soever it be done, doth make the number
                  double so much as was before, and sometimes doth extend the length of the battell
                  to double the proportion of ground, as well as well as number.
               </p> 
               <p class="p">Doublings of files (or flankes) doe also double the number in depth, and sometimes
                  becomes a doubling both of number and place. Wherefore for the better understanding
                  of the doublings, observe with me these sixe usuall waies following.

               <p class="p">The first is the doubling of rankes, and is when every even ranke doubleth into the
                  odde; the second is, when the halfe-files double their ranks forwards into the Front: the third,
                  when the Bringers-up double their ranks forwards into the Front. The fourth when the
                  Front-halfe files doubleth <span class="pb">36 @tcp:1160:32</span> the Reere. These first foure being doublings of ranks, the length of the battell being
                  by them extended either simply in number, or both in number and place. The next two
                  are doublings of flanks: the first whereof is the ordinary doublings of files, every
                  one of the even files being inserted into the odde files, accounting from the hand
                  named. The next is the doubling of halfe-rankes, which is to be understood when one
                  flanke doubleth the other, either by passing through, countermarch, doubling intire, or divisionall.
               </p> 
               <p class="p">You are to note in this motion of doubling, that as there is one part of the body

                     forth with that foot which is next unto the place named, and in the reducement, to

                  one figure will be sufficient, which I hold most necessary to demonstrate in manner

               </p> <span class="figure2"></span> 
               <p class="p">This doubling of Ranks by Bringers up, differeth from the other doubling of ranks, first done, both in quantity and quality. In
                  quantity it differeth, in regard the other leaves a large distance betweene Ranke and Ranke, being
                  double the distance they formerly stood at: this contrariwise continuing and preserving the same
                  distance they formerly stood at betweene each Ranke. In quality it also differeth, in regard that it brings the best and second sort of Souldiers,
                  together into the Front. The manner of this doubling you may <span class="pb">45 @tcp:1160:36</span> plainely perceive by the figure, where it is performed as followeth. The eight or last ranke, which are the bringers up, passe forwards
                  even in ranke, through or betweene the intervales, to the right of them that stand
                  before them, until they come even in ranke with the Front; The seventh rank following those which marched from behinde them, placing themselves in the second Rank,
                  the sixth in the third, the fifth ranke or halfe file in the fourth or reere of the
                  front halfe file. This doubling maketh a very able Front, in bringing all the best Souldiers together. And although
                  it hath diminished the number, in regard of the depth, yet it hath doubled the number in the
                  length. This doubling is in quantity of number, not of ground. When you march into
                  your places, remember this, that the Rank which last tooke his place in the execution
                  of this motion, must first march into his place in the way of reducement. For as they
                  are led forth by their Bringers up, contrariwise they are led off by their halfe file
                  leaders.
               </p> 
               <p class="p">In the doubling of the Front to the left by Bringers up, it is the same, onely differing in this, that whereas before it was to the
                  Right, this is to the Left. Wherefore let this suffice for doublings, by Bringers
                  up.

                  the left flanke to the left. As you may plainely perceive by the following Figure.

                  Interuale in the midst. Some say it is good when a Commander will grace any, to bring
                  them through the center or midst of the Battalia. But you must note, if you have an
                  odde File you cannot so punctually performe it, as when the number of your Files be
                  even. The manner of the doubling, you may perceive by the Figure; The motion, by the

                  Bringers up, in quality, not in quantity, (for therein they keepe one proportion:) In quality it differeth thus: The doubling by Bringers up brought the best
                  and second sort of souldiers together into the Front; The fourth and third sort into the Reere: So that the
                  Reere was 4/7 worse then the Front: This doubling by Halfe-files brings the best and
                  the third together into the Front, and leaves the second and fourth in the Reere:
                  So that the Front is made more able, then the Reere, by ⅓. It differeth likewise in
                  Motion thus; For whereas in the other doubling, by Bringers up, the Motion was begun, by the last Ranke<span class="g2">▪</span> every Ranke following the Ranke which came from behind him: This contrarywise is directly led foorth by the fift Ranke from the Front, (if they be but eight
                  deepe) and so is executed more surely and suddenly; the fift Ranke passing into the first; the sixth Ranke into the second; the seventh into the third, and so for the rest. For the reducement, when they are commanded to face about to the left, and march forth into
                  their places; Then as the Motion was led on by the Halfe-file-leaders, so in the reducement,
                  they are led off by the Bringers up: Doubling of halfe-files to the left produceth

                  and Place; The right Flanke being wholly inserted, into the left Flanke, as you may
                  perceive by the <span class="pb">56 @tcp:1160:42</span> Figure; The Motion is to be performed on this manner: The halfe-rankes of the Right,
                  Face to the Right, and then Even in ranke together, Countermarch betweene the Intervales, untill the outmost file to the Right, which is marked with the figure 1, be come into the outmost
                  File of the left Flanke, which is marked with the number 16: The second into the fifteenth;
                  the third into the foureteenth; The fourth into the thirteenth: and the rest in like manner. The use of this
                  doubling is, to strengthen one of the Flankes, by bringing more hands, to doe present
                  execution; the other Flanke being in more surety. The way for the Reducement of this Motion is, after this manner; The halfe-ranks last doubled, being faced
                  to the Right, then they which were the last, which tooke their places in the Motion,
                  now are the first, which take their places in the Reducement; orderly marching in
                  Ranke together, untill they come to their places: Then facing to their Leader, they
                  become Files againe. The left flanke may in like manner, double the Right by Countermarch;
                  The difference is this: The right Flanke stands, the left Flanke is inserted into
                  the Right, as before the Right was into the Left. To shew another Figure for it, would
                  be altogether needlesse.

                  flanke into the other, a different way from that last shewen. But if I should performe it, as the body
                  stands, in the ordinary square, flanked with Muskettiers: then it would produce a mixture of Armes. To avoid which, before
                  you enter upon this doubling, of passing in, through or betweene your halfe rankes;
                  Cause your halfe files to double the Front to the right intire, which being performed,
                  you may then proceed to the doubling of your flanks, any way without mixture of Armes.
                  If I should have shewen this motion with Pikes or Muskettiers alone, this first doubling of halfe files intire, might have beene spared: but I desire not to leave any thing obscure or difficult, but to render it as
                  easie and apparant as I may, to the capacity of the meanest reader: and if any place
                  in this small Treatise of mine shall seem ambiguous, I shall intreate the courteous
                  to impute it to my lacke of language to expresse my selfe, rather than any will in me to

                  this Booke contained. But left by doubling of words, I prove tardy in my worke; I will forbeare further circumstance, and come to the prosecution of the matter: which in the first place, will
                  be a doubling of halfe files to the right intire, whereby the next doubling may be the more commodiously accomplished. The figure followeth.
               </p> <span class="figure2"></span> 
               <p class="p">This doubling of halfe files to the right intire, I have fully exprest in the figure,
                  as the body stands, the motion being ended: because we are to adde another doubling,
                  before wee reduce them. This figure next following, will be best shewen in <span class="pb">59 @tcp:1160:43</span> the motion or action, not fully performed: that thereby the manner may be the more
                  easily discerned. But by the way observe, that this doubling of halfe files, is a doubling both of number and place; for the length of the
                  Battalia is not only double so many a breast as they were before, but they also have extended ther length
                  to double their proportion of ground, which formerly they did occupie. I forbeare to speake
                  more of this doubling, untill we come to shew it in motion: and now proceed to the
                  next doubling upon this. The command is as followeth.

               <p class="p"><span class="pb">60 @tcp:1160:44</span> This doubling of halfe rankes is a more speedy and sure doubling, then the doubling
                  of halfe ranks by countermarch, but is most commonly used when the body consists but
                  of one sort of Armes, being either all Muskettiers, or all Pikes. But because in my
                  figures I have as well Muskettiers as Pikes, I have made use of a Doubling intire, and from that have doubled my left flanke, to prevent the mixture of Armes:
                  However mixture of Armes upon some occasion may be necessary. The manner to performe
                  the motion, is this. The left flanke stands, the halfe ranks of the right, face to
                  the left; and then the inmost file of the right flanke, (all the files of the right
                  flanke, being by this facing become ranks) is the leader of this motion, marching forth right to their left hands, between the intervales of the rankes of the left flank, untill that the sixteenth file
                  which now is become a ranke, have placed themselves orderly in the two and thirtieth
                  file, (which is the outmost file of the left flanke.) The fifteenth in the one and
                  thirtieth, the fourteenth in the thirtieth: the thirteenth in the nine and twentieth;
                  and so likewise of all the rest. The places may be perceived by the figure. The doubling is of number, and not of place. For reducement
                  to both these doublings, first cause the halfe rankes which last doubled, to face
                  to the right, and so to march into their places. They that last tooke their places
                  in the motion, are the first that take their places in the reducement. The doubling
                  of halfe ranks being thus reduced, next for the reducing of the halfe <span class="pb">61 @tcp:1160:44</span> files, (which were doubled before, for the accomodating<span class="margin-left note1">Order in Ranke and File. The distance required for intire Doubling.</span> of the doubling of halfe-ranks) command the halfe files to face about to the left, and to march forth into their places:
                  Wherewith I will conclude these sort of doublings, which require open order in Ranke and File, and come next to shew intire doublings, which
                  claime a closer distance for their true performance. And therfore conceive them closed to their order, both in Ranke and File.

                  are disranked and divided into more parts or places than one. This may serve for way of distinction:
                  I will now shew intire doublings, as they are in action: and first beginne with doubling
                  halfe-files. The Figure followeth.
               </p> <span class="figure2"></span> 
               <p class="p">This doubling of halfe-files intire, hath beene held a better doubling; then either
                  the ordinary doubling of Ranks, or the usuall way of doubling by halfe-files or Bringers
                  up: some of the causes are these. First it makes no disturbance to the other part of the Battalia; but that it may either be executed in time of motion, exercise,
                  or skirmish. Secondly, it appeares another solid body, to the <span class="pb">63 @tcp:1160:45</span> great disheartening of any enemy. Thirdly, it is very apt for over-fronting; being
                  a doubling both of number and place. The way to performe the motion, is this. The
                  halfe-files face to the left, and march till they are quite cleere of that part of
                  the body, which stands; then they face to their Leader, and so march up, untill they are become even in ranke with those which stand upon the right flanke: and then the Figure will
                  be perfect. For the reducement; the word of command is, <span class="hi2">Halfe Files face about to the right, march forth into your places:</span> having faced about, they march straight forth, untill they be cleere of the front
                  halfe-files; then they face to the left, and march straight forth, untill every man
                  hath his right place, and then face right after their Leaders. The doubling of halfe-files
                  to the right intire, is performed after the same manner, onely differing in the hand.

                  and face to their Leader. Then the halfe files march up, and even their Front. For
                  the reducement of this Figure, there are (as there are for all the rest) divers waies.
                  But because that it is necessary to shew one, let the halfe files face about to the
                  Reere, and march untill they are cleere of the Front halfe files, then stand and face to their Leader;
                  then the other halfe files of the Front, close their division, and they are reduced.

               <p class="p"><span class="pb">69 @tcp:1160:48</span> For the manner or way of this Motion, it may be thus performed: The Front halfe-files

                  to bee Even in Ranke with them, whom they had Command to Double; which perfects the
                  Doubling. The way to Reduce them, is as followeth: If you keepe your place of the
                  first Front, Then let your Halfe-files<span class="g2">▪</span> Face about, (according to former directions,) and March untill they are cleere of the Reere Halfe-files, which stand; Then Face to the Right
                  and Left inward, and close their Divisions; And being Eaced all to their Leader, they
                  are Reduced. Sundry, and divers ways there are, for Reducement both of this and most other Figures. Neuerthelesse
                  I conceive, if I give one Reducement to each Figure, it may suffice to those that
                  know little; As for such which know better, they know more wayes to the Wood then
                  one: And surely, should I inlarge my selfe, but halfe so much as I might, (and indeed
                  in some things, no more then were needfull) I should then bring my Volume into too
                  great a Bulke, and by the price, hinder some of the profit: But I am willingly silent in some things, whereby others may be the better encouraged by my weaknesses,
                  to take notice of their owne worths, which may induce them to put Pen to paper, and thereby produce some worthy worke, which may tend to their Credits, and their Countreys good.

               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">I</span>F I would strive to bee curious, I should need no other subject to lengthen my discourse,
                  but onely this, of <span class="hi2">Inversion</span> and <span class="hi2">Conversion,</span> which of it selfe would yeeld matter sufficient to make a Booke of. But I have taken a large taske. And therefore like
                  the Artists in Geography, who sometimes by a <span class="hi2">spot,</span> present a <span class="hi2">Town,</span> and by a <span class="hi2">wrinckled line,</span> a large <span class="hi2">River:</span> so must I crave of the favourable Reader, that in this small Treatise of Discipline,
                  he will not expect that I should inlarge my selfe so amply, as I might, upon every
                  part. For then my booke would grow beyond his bounds, and I beyond my promise; but lest I be taxed for digression, this
                  that hath already beene shewne, may suffice for <span class="hi2">Conversion.</span> But because it may be expected, that I should shew <span class="hi2">Conversion</span> in Figure, as well as the other Motions, therefore to gratifie such, I shall demonstrate
                  two <span class="pb">98 @tcp:1160:65</span> Figures unto them: which may serve for all the rest. The one shall be of <span class="hi2">rankes wheeling, by Conversion:</span> the other of <span class="hi2">files ranking, foure to the left.</span> The word of <span class="hi2">command</span> for the first, stands placed right over the <span class="hi2">figure.</span></p> <span class="figure2"></span> <span class="pb">98 @tcp:1160:66</span> <span class="gap1"><span class="desc">〈1 page duplicate〉</span></span> 
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">99 @tcp:1160:66</span> This foregoing <span class="hi2">figure</span> of <span class="hi2">Conversion,</span> is of <span class="hi2">Rankes, wheeling to the right and left,</span> or <span class="hi2">ranks ranking to each flanke by wheeling.</span> It differeth from <span class="hi2">ranks filing,</span> both in manner and matter. In the manner thus, Whereas in <span class="hi2">ranks filing</span> to the right and left; the <span class="hi2">right</span> and <span class="hi2">left-hand file-leaders,</span> preserve and continue their places; and with that, their honours. In this <span class="hi2">wheeling by Conversion to the right and left,</span> contrariwise: the <span class="hi2">innermost file-leaders,</span> become the <span class="hi2">outmost</span> men in that pure where the <span class="hi2">front</span> stood; the other <span class="hi2">file-leaders ranking even</span> within them. Some men have called this, <span class="hi2">Rankes, filing by Conversion, to the right and left,</span> but corruptly. For <span class="hi2">conversion</span> alwaies produceth <span class="hi2">rankes,</span> as I formerly said: and <span class="hi2">inversion, files.</span> But their mistake groweth from this, that when <span class="hi2">rankes wheele to the right,</span> or <span class="hi2">right</span> and <span class="hi2">left,</span> then (say they) they by <span class="hi2">wheeling,</span> become <span class="hi2">file,</span> or <span class="hi2">files,</span> which is a palpable <span class="hi2">mistake.</span> For when we have any <span class="hi2">command</span> for <span class="hi2">wheeling,</span> it is a <span class="hi2">maxime</span> for us, to <span class="hi2">wheele our aspects unto the hand or part named.</span> By which doing, we either become ranke, or rankes: and not files, as some have sought
                  formerly to maintaine. One use, among many, for this <span class="hi2">motion</span> is. It is the speediest way for a great <span class="hi2">body</span> (if they have their due distance) to <span class="hi2">give fire to one, or both flanks,</span> that as yet I know of. The way to performe this <span class="hi2">motion,</span> is as followeth. The <span class="hi2">right</span> and <span class="hi2">left-hand-men,</span> of every <span class="hi2">ranke,</span> became the <span class="hi2">Hindges</span> of the <span class="hi2">motion:</span> the rest of each ranke, <span class="hi2">wheeling by equall division,</span> to the right and left about, and above their right and left-hand Leaders, untill they
                  become ranks to the flanks. As you may perceive <span class="pb">100 @tcp:1160:67</span> by the Figure, where the <span class="hi2">pricks</span> denote unto you, the <span class="hi2">places</span> they stood in before the <span class="hi2">motion:</span> the <span class="hi2">quarter circles,</span> shewing the <span class="hi2">way</span> of their <span class="hi2">motion:</span> themselves being converted into two ranks, sheweth the motion executed. I have onely <span class="hi2">converted</span> three of the rankes; for it would have taken too much roome, to have <span class="hi2">wheeled</span> all the <span class="hi2">ranks.</span> And it is easie by this that is shewne, to conceive the rest. If you would avoid <span class="hi2">mixture of Armes,</span> then place all your <span class="hi2">Muskettiers,</span> either in <span class="hi2">Front,</span> or <span class="hi2">Reere:</span> or else <span class="hi2">wheele</span> onely your <span class="hi2">Muskettiers,</span> and leave your <span class="hi2">Pikes, standing.</span> Or else it may be done; the <span class="hi2">body marching</span> at <span class="hi2">length:</span> the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers</span> being in the <span class="hi2">front,</span> and <span class="hi2">reere Divisions.</span> The <span class="hi2">word</span> for the <span class="hi2">reducement</span> is; <span class="hi2">rankes, ranke as you were.</span></p> 
               <p class="p">The easiest way for the <span class="hi2">reducement,</span> will be first for to <span class="hi2">face</span> to the <span class="hi2">reere,</span> and then to <span class="hi2">wheele backe</span> into their places. Then, <span class="hi2">face</span> to their <span class="hi2">leader;</span> and they will be reduced as at first. Now we will come to shew the next <span class="hi2">figure</span> of <span class="hi2">Conversion,</span> which is of <span class="hi2">files</span> converted into <span class="hi2">ranks</span> by <span class="hi2">equall proportion.</span></p>

               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">I</span>N this <span class="hi2">Chapter,</span> I intend to shew the <span class="hi2">manner, of files ranking by Conversion, in equall parts;</span> which <span class="hi2">Motion,</span> I have seene used by some <span class="hi2">Commanders,</span> at such times as their <span class="hi2">Companies</span> have been but small, having not had above two or three <span class="hi2">files</span> of <span class="hi2">Muskettiers,</span> upon a <span class="hi2">flanke;</span> and being willing, to <span class="hi2">march forth</span> their <span class="hi2">Companies</span> in <span class="hi2">divisions:</span> And this, because, that two a <span class="hi2">brest</span> would be somwhat improper (unlesse it were upon necessity, in some narrow <span class="hi2">passage)</span> and that three a <span class="hi2">brest,</span> is also somewhat with the thinnest. Therefore to augment the <span class="hi2">front</span> of their march, they have <span class="hi2">shartned</span> somewhat of their <span class="hi2">depths,</span> in each division: by causing their <span class="hi2">files,</span> to <span class="hi2">ranke</span> foure, or five, according as their <span class="hi2">depth</span> may be, when the <span class="hi2">Command</span> shall be given. This <span class="hi2">Motion</span> of <span class="hi2">Conversion,</span> may also be usefull for <span class="hi2">larger bodies.</span> For if upon a <span class="hi2">March,</span> you are to passe thorough some <span class="hi2">streight,</span> where not above foure or five, can <span class="hi2">march</span> a <span class="hi2">brest;</span> and that being past thorough, you are to direct your course, to the <span class="hi2">right,</span> or <span class="hi2">left:</span> If <span class="pb">102 @tcp:1160:68</span> your way be to the <span class="hi2">right,</span> then cause your <span class="hi2">files</span> to ranke to the <span class="hi2">left:</span> If to the <span class="hi2">left,</span> then let the <span class="hi2">files</span> ranke to the contrary hand. For by so doing; having past the <span class="hi2">streight,</span> and <span class="hi2">faced</span> your <span class="hi2">body</span> that way, which you intend your <span class="hi2">March,</span> by commanding the <span class="hi2">File-leaders</span> to <span class="hi2">march;</span> and the <span class="hi2">half-files</span> to <span class="hi2">stand,</span> and take their places: your <span class="hi2">body</span> will be led again by their <span class="hi2">proper file-leaders,</span> all a <span class="hi2">brest;</span> the <span class="hi2">Musketiers</span> becomming again the <span class="hi2">Flankers,</span> which in the passage of the <span class="hi2">streight,</span> were in the <span class="hi2">Front</span> and <span class="hi2">Reere.</span> For the better understanding the manner of the <span class="hi2">Motion,</span> observe the following <span class="hi2">figure.</span></p> <span class="figure2"></span> 
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">104 @tcp:1160:69</span> The way to performe this <span class="hi2">Motion,</span> is as followeth. The <span class="hi2">Command</span> being first given (as abovesaid) the <span class="hi2">right-hand-file-leader,</span> leadeth forth his <span class="hi2">file:</span> &amp; the <span class="hi2">three next</span> men behind him, move forwards to the <span class="hi2">left</span> of each other; untill they <span class="hi2">ranke even</span> a <span class="hi2">brest</span> with their <span class="hi2">file-leader.</span> The next <span class="hi2">foure,</span> in like manner <span class="hi2">ranking</span> to the <span class="hi2">left,</span> make the <span class="hi2">second ranke.</span> The <span class="hi2">file-leader</span> of the <span class="hi2">second file,</span> placeth himselfe, next after him, that was the <span class="hi2">half-file-leader</span> of the <span class="hi2">first,</span> which now is become the <span class="hi2">right-hand-man</span> of the <span class="hi2">second ranke;</span> the three <span class="hi2">next men</span> behind him, making up of his <span class="hi2">rank,</span> in like manner. And so forward for all the rest, untill the <span class="hi2">Motion</span> be fully perfected. This converts each <span class="hi2">file,</span> into two <span class="hi2">ranks;</span> and brings all the <span class="hi2">proper file-leaders,</span> and <span class="hi2">half-file-leaders,</span> to make the <span class="hi2">outmost file</span> to the <span class="hi2">right:</span> the <span class="hi2">Bringers-up,</span> both of the <span class="hi2">Front,</span> and <span class="hi2">Reere-half-files;</span> make the <span class="hi2">outermost file</span> to the <span class="hi2">left.</span> The <span class="hi2">figures</span> of <span class="hi2">Number,</span> which are on the <span class="hi2">left flanke</span> of the <span class="hi2">figure,</span> in which, the word <span class="hi2">file</span> added to each of them, demonstrate <span class="hi2">places</span> of the <span class="hi2">first, second, third,</span> and <span class="hi2">fourth file,</span> and so consequently for all the rest; according to their <span class="hi2">former standing,</span> and the <span class="hi2">places</span> they now occupy, being <span class="hi2">converted</span> into <span class="hi2">ranks.</span> The <span class="hi2">letters f,</span> and <span class="hi2">h,</span> which are placed on the <span class="hi2">right flanke;</span> shewes the <span class="hi2">places</span> of those, which were the <span class="hi2">file-leaders,</span> and <span class="hi2">half-file-leaders:</span> each of the <span class="hi2">propex file-leaders,</span> having now his <span class="hi2">half-file-leader,</span> next after him<span class="g2">▪</span> I have showne this <span class="hi2">figure</span> partly <span class="hi2">performed</span> partly <span class="hi2">performing,</span> and partly <span class="hi2">standing,</span> as before the Motion began.

               <h2 class="head">Of Countermarches. Their Antiquity, and words of direction.</h2> 
               <p class="p"><span class="simple_dropcap">T</span>He next branch of <span class="hi2">Discipline</span> which offers it selfe to your perusall, are <span class="hi2">Countermarches:</span> which are of three kinds. To wit, <span class="hi2">Chorean, Lacedamonian, Macedonian:</span> which is, Maintaining, Loosing, and Gaining. Each of them are to be performed two
                  manner of waies. One by <span class="hi2">File:</span> the other by <span class="hi2">Ranke.</span></p> 
               <p class="p">There are also <span class="hi2">Counter-marches, Intire</span> and <span class="hi2">Divisionall.</span> But divers men, are divers for their opinions concerning the <span class="hi2">Macedonian</span> and <span class="hi2">Lacedamonian</span> Counter-marches. Some will have the <span class="hi2">Macedonian,</span> A Counter-march of gaining of ground; because that it transfers the <span class="hi2">Battalia,</span> into the ground before the <span class="hi2">Front.</span> Others will have it, A Counter-march of losse of ground; because (say they) the <span class="hi2">Enemy</span> being in the <span class="hi2">Reere,</span> it makes a semblance of flying. Some will have the <span class="hi2">Lacedamonian,</span> A Counter-march of gaining of ground: because the <span class="hi2">Enemy</span> appearing in the <span class="hi2">Reere,</span> it makes a semblance of Charging or falling on. Others call it, A Countermarch of losse of ground: because it looseth all <span class="pb">109 @tcp:1160:71</span> that ground the <span class="hi2">Battalia</span> stood upon; taking in stead thereof, the ground behind the <span class="hi2">Reere.</span> There are others of opinion, That there are Counter-marches of losse and gaine, in
                  either of them. All these are furnished with <span class="hi2">reasons,</span> to backe their <span class="hi2">opinions.</span> But if I should stand to shew their many and severall reasons, I might well be thought
                  to be without reason my selfe. My opinion is; That taking the ground before the <span class="hi2">Front,</span> is gaining ground: and that to leave the ground we stood on, to take the ground next
                  behind the <span class="hi2">Reere,</span> is losse of ground: And yet to take either, whereby there is advantage gotten, must
                  needs be gaining. But where the matter it selfe is so indifferent, it were fondnesse
                  to spend longer time about it. Wherefore note, That <span class="hi2">Countermarches</span> were of ancient use amongst the Greekes many hundred of yeeres since, &amp; from them
                  learned and practised, by many other <span class="hi2">Nations;</span> and so still continued unto this day. But as the <span class="hi2">Snow-ball</span> by much rowling, becomes the greater: So, in like manner, these <span class="hi2">Counter-marches</span> have received <span class="hi2">addition</span> in all ages. So that the three originall ones are now become more then thirty accounting
                  those <span class="hi2">divisionall.</span> And yet are all of them fathered upon one or other, of the three kinds. Though some
                  of them will scarcely be owned or acknowledged; as you shall perceive, when I come
                  to shew them in their severall places. But amongst all the <span class="hi2">Motions,</span> this might be the best spared: as being least <span class="hi2">beneficiall,</span> to this our <span class="hi2">moderne Discipline.</span> But because that <span class="hi2">knowledge is no burthen;</span> and that at some times they may be usefull: Therefore <span class="pb">110 @tcp:1160:72</span> first take the <span class="hi2">words</span> of <span class="hi2">command</span> or <span class="hi2">direction,</span> which are as followeth.

                     concluding them for <span class="hi2">nicities,</span> and for no service; because they cannot presently apprehend, for what use, or service
                     they may be fit. Notwithstanding I would intreat such (if any such happen to be my
                     overlookers) that they would suspend their censures, untill they have fully enformed <span class="pb">146 @tcp:1160:90</span> their judgements.

                     in them. Neverthelesse such is the wilfull stupidity of the times, that many good, and usefull things
                     are disreputed, and accounted of no use, because the Souldier wanting skill, cannot
                     performe them, as they ought: which would the <span class="hi2">Officers</span> take more paines, by often instructing their <span class="hi2">Souldiers,</span> the hardest <span class="hi2">Motions</span> would become facile and easie. And to say truth, the greatest fault is, want of skill in those, which should give instruction to others; and
                     yet they will not sticke, to carpe at such, as shall shew more, than they, concluding
                     such things for superfluous, and improper, which they themselues do not rightly understand:

                     and unexperienced. I have seene some <span class="hi2">Companies,</span> which have been so absolutely ignorant, that each man would have needed an <span class="hi2">Officer,</span> to have kept him orderly in his place. Neverthelesse I make no doubt, but that by
                     the carefull oversight of the <span class="hi2">Lord Lieutenants,</span> the good assistance of their <span class="hi2">Deputies,</span> and the diligence of the <span class="hi2">Captains,</span> and their Officers, this fault will quickly be amended.

                     to carry their <span class="hi2">Armes</span> with more ease; and to use them with more delight. Neither need they to be altogether

By which having attained some little
                     skill; they will not be contented, untill they have better improved it by the instruction
                     of their <span class="hi2">Officers:</span> after which they will proue better <span class="hi2">proficients</span> in one houre, then as they were before, in a yeare.

This done, the next two <span class="hi2">outmost-files</span> of each <span class="hi2">flanke,</span> are to <span class="hi2">march</span> forwards unto the <span class="hi2">place</span> assigned<span class="g2">▪</span> and to do the like: those <span class="hi2">files</span> which formerly <span class="hi2">faced,</span> in the meane time <span class="hi2">trooping</span> backe, and placing themselues next the <span class="hi2">pikes,</span> on the <span class="hi2">inside</span> of the <span class="hi2">divisions</span> of <span class="pb">188 @tcp:1160:111</span> <span class="hi2">Muskettiers:</span> the rest of the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers</span> (in like manner) <span class="hi2">marching up,</span> and <span class="hi2">firing:</span> still placing themselues next the <span class="hi2">pikes,</span> as aforesaid.

               <p class="p">The Pikes being now come to <span class="hi2">push,</span> the Muskettiers are to <span class="hi2">advance</span> no further than the <span class="hi2">halfe files</span> of Pikes: that (so they may doe <span class="hi2">execution</span> with their <span class="pb">194 @tcp:1160:114</span> <span class="hi2">shot,</span> and be out of danger of the Pikes.

In this <span class="hi2">firing,</span> still the ranke which is next to <span class="hi2">fire,</span> stands even in ranke with them which last <span class="hi2">fired;</span> untill those which <span class="hi2">stand presented,</span> have likewise <span class="hi2">given fire:</span> after which they then passe before them; the Ranke which was their next followers, passing forwards and ranking with those which last <span class="hi2">fired:</span> every man following his Leader successively, untill the <span class="hi2">Bringers up</span> give <span class="hi2">fire, &amp; stand,</span> and then the Figure will become a <span class="hi2">Horne battell.</span> All the while that this <span class="hi2">firing</span> by <span class="hi2">Introduction,</span> is continued, the Pikes may be shouldered (if there be no feare of <span class="hi2">horse)</span> or otherwise at discretion. If you continue this <span class="hi2">firing</span> twice over; the Muskettiers will have their <span class="hi2">right places:</span> which being done, <span class="hi2">march</span> up your Pikes, to ranke even with your Muskettiers in <span class="hi2">front,</span> and they are <span class="hi2">reduced.</span> For the other way of <span class="hi2">firing by introduction,</span> the first ranke (or <span class="hi2">file-leaders)</span> are to <span class="hi2">give fire</span> as before, and to stand, the last ranke (or <span class="hi2">bringers up)</span> in the interim of their <span class="hi2">firing; marching up,</span> and <span class="hi2">ranking even</span> with the second ranke: the rest following their <span class="hi2">Bringers up;</span> as they do when <span class="hi2">Bringers up</span> double their <span class="hi2">front.</span> The first ranke having <span class="hi2">fired,</span> the <span class="hi2">Bringers up</span> step immediately before them; <span class="hi2">present,</span> and <span class="hi2">give fire;</span> the rest stil, successively, doing the like, untill every rank have <span class="hi2">given fire</span> once over. Observe withal that the <span class="hi2">file-leaders</span> are to <span class="hi2">give fire</span> twice over: being the first &amp; the last &amp; then to <span class="hi2">stand,</span> the <span class="hi2">Pikes</span> marching <span class="pb">204 @tcp:1160:119</span> <span class="hi2">up,</span> even with their front of Muskettiers. And thus they are <span class="hi2">reduccd,</span> as at first. The Pikemen, all the time of this <span class="hi2">firing,</span> doe no service: Notwithstanding, if one <span class="hi2">halfe</span> of them had <span class="hi2">bowes</span> fastened unto their Pikes (being able and well practised men) they might, whilest
                     the Muskettiers are in <span class="hi2">firing,</span> be dealing of their doles about: and although their <span class="hi2">arrowes</span> did not happen to wound mortally, yet the whisteling noyse, the terrour of the sight,
                     and the severall hurts (which could not chuse but be many) would be a great abatement
                     to the stoutest courages. And great pitty it is to see, the lusty <span class="hi2">Pike-man</span> poorely to droppe downe by the <span class="hi2">Musket-shot;</span> himselfe not being able to hurt his enemy at that distance, nor defend himselfe.

               <p class="p">First cause your Muskettiers of the right flanke, to open to the right, to a sufficient

                     first, is the most usuall way: and that is, the <span class="hi2">giving fire in ranke;</span> the first man (or <span class="hi2">poynt</span> of the <span class="hi2">Diamond)</span> first <span class="hi2">giving fire:</span> then wheeling off to the <span class="hi2">right,</span> and placing himselfe just behinde the <span class="hi2">single Pikeman,</span> in the <span class="hi2">reere.</span> Then, the <span class="hi2">next ranke</span> being three men, <span class="hi2">give fire; wheeling off</span> by <span class="hi2">division:</span> and placing themselves in <span class="hi2">ranke,</span> behinde the <span class="hi2">single Muskettiers,</span> as they were before the <span class="hi2">firing</span> began. This done, the <span class="hi2">ranke</span> of five <span class="hi2">Muskettiers, gives fire; wheeling off,</span> in like manner, by <span class="hi2">division<span class="g2">▪</span></span> ever observing, that where the <span class="hi2">number</span> is <span class="hi2">odde,</span> &amp; they command to <span class="hi2">wheele off</span> by <span class="hi2">division;</span> there the greatest number, alwaies goes to the <span class="hi2">right.</span> And so, in like manner, the <span class="hi2">rankes give fire,</span> successively; and place themselves after their <span class="hi2">leaders,</span> as before. When all the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers</span> have <span class="hi2">given fire,</span> and are <span class="hi2">wheeled off;</span> then <span class="hi2">charge Pikes,</span> which will be fifteene in the <span class="hi2">first ranke;</span> the rest <span class="hi2">decreasing,</span> Having advanced your <span class="hi2">Pikes,</span> your figure will stand like two <span class="hi2">wedges,</span> with their poynts <span class="hi2">ioyned,</span> as you may perceive by this Figure next following.
                  </p> <span class="figure2"></span> 
                  <p class="p">If you would <span class="hi2">reduce</span> your men from this Figure, without <span class="hi2">firing,</span> (your men being sufficiently expert) let the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers stand,</span> and <span class="hi2">Pikes face</span> to the <span class="hi2">reere:</span> and so the <span class="hi2">wedges</span> will stand <span class="hi2">faced</span> in <span class="hi2">opposition.</span> Next, <span class="hi2">command</span> them to <span class="hi2">interchange ground:</span> the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers</span> advancing forwards, into the <span class="hi2">ground</span> of the <span class="hi2">Pikes,</span> and the <span class="hi2">Pikes,</span> moving into the <span class="hi2">ground</span> of the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers;</span> and then by <span class="hi2">facing</span> the <span class="hi2">Pikes</span> to the <span class="hi2">former front,</span> the <span class="hi2">body</span> will stand in forme of a <span class="hi2">Diamond</span> againe.
                  </p> 
                  <p class="p">If you would <span class="hi2">give fire</span> from this Figure (all the <span class="pb">209 @tcp:1160:121</span> Muskettiers being in the <span class="hi2">reere)</span> the <span class="hi2">body</span> must <span class="hi2">face about:</span> and so the <span class="hi2">firing</span> will be contrary to the former. But if you <span class="hi2">wheele them about,</span> they may <span class="hi2">give fire</span> the same way. Howsoever, they having <span class="hi2">given fire,</span> are to <span class="hi2">wheele off</span> by <span class="hi2">division,</span> and to place themselves in the <span class="hi2">reere</span> of the Pikes, <span class="hi2">even</span> in ranke again, as they were when they <span class="hi2">gave fire.</span> Thus having all <span class="hi2">fired</span> ouer, and <span class="hi2">wheeled away;</span> the Pikes may charge: and being againe <span class="hi2">advanced,</span> the <span class="hi2">body</span> will stand in forme of a <span class="hi2">Diamond<span class="g2">▪</span></span> and this I pray you to conceive, for I intend not to remake the Figure.
                  </p> 
                  <p class="p">The <span class="hi2">second</span> way of <span class="hi2">firing</span> on the <span class="hi2">Diamond figure,</span> is by way of <span class="hi2">Countermarch<span class="g2">▪</span></span> and is an <span class="hi2">oblique firing.</span> For whereas in the other <span class="hi2">firing</span> by <span class="hi2">ranks</span> (in the <span class="hi2">Diamond Battell)</span> each <span class="hi2">ranke fired</span> by <span class="hi2">increase</span> of two <span class="hi2">(beginning</span> with <span class="hi2">one,</span> and <span class="hi2">ending</span> with fifteene in a <span class="hi2">ranke)</span> this <span class="hi2">firing,</span> contrariwise, <span class="hi2">begins</span> with 15. and <span class="hi2">ends</span> with 1. still <span class="hi2">decreasing</span> 2.

                  <p class="p">Sometimes, we <span class="hi2">give fire</span> in the <span class="hi2">reere:</span> having all our <span class="hi2">Muskettiers marching</span> in the <span class="hi2">reere</span> of the pikes. For the <span class="hi2">manner</span> of the <span class="hi2">motion,</span> it is as before: but for <span class="hi2">placing</span> of the men, after they have <span class="hi2">fired;</span> it may be different. As, to <span class="hi2">wheele off by division,</span> placing themselues in the <span class="hi2">front</span> of the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers,</span> next behinde the <span class="hi2">reere</span> of pikes.

                  <p class="p">I might have shewne a Figure for each of these severall <span class="hi2">firings</span> in the <span class="hi2">reere:</span> which would have delivered them with more variety: but I conceive that this here already exprest, may
                     suffice: especially this being the ground of what may be spoken. Concerning <span class="hi2">firings</span> in this nature, many men are of many mindes, about this <span class="hi2">firing in the reere.</span> Some will have it, that the <span class="hi2">last ranke,</span> shall at one <span class="hi2">motion,</span> <span class="pb">225 @tcp:1160:129</span> <span class="hi2">face</span> to the <span class="hi2">reere:</span> and there <span class="hi2">present,</span> and <span class="hi2">give fire.</span> Others will have it at two <span class="hi2">motions;</span> but either of them have their inconveniences. For however they pretend a more <span class="hi2">sudden execution,</span> they are decerved: for would they make tryall, by causing the Muskettiers of one of the <span class="hi2">flanks,</span> to <span class="hi2">give fire</span> at one <span class="hi2">motion;</span> and the Muskettiers of the other <span class="hi2">flanke,</span> at three <span class="hi2">motions,</span> (as I have here set downe) they should soone finde, that the <span class="hi2">firing</span> upon three <span class="hi2">motions</span> were the best: and that the other would be cast so farre behinde their <span class="hi2">body,</span> that they would be in some danger to be <span class="hi2">cut off.</span> Besides this, they are <span class="hi2">longer</span> in <span class="hi2">clearing</span> themselves from their owne men, which all the whilst must <span class="hi2">stay,</span> untill they are <span class="hi2">marched off:</span> or else <span class="hi2">kill</span> them, in stead of the <span class="hi2">enemy,</span> whereas in this other <span class="hi2">firing</span> upon three <span class="hi2">motions,</span> they still <span class="hi2">keepe along</span> with their <span class="hi2">Body,</span> doing their <span class="hi2">execution</span> more suddenly and more safely. Neverthelesse, there be many so much wedded to <span class="gap1"><span class="desc">•</span></span>heir own wilfull opinion, that they will more willingly persist in knowne <span class="hi2">errour,</span> then be seene to alter what they have seemed to maintaine. But leaving such to <span class="hi2">steere</span> by their owne <span class="hi2">compasse,</span> I will here conclude my <span class="hi2">firing</span> in the <span class="hi2">reere.</span> And the next I shew, shall be <span class="hi2">firings in flanks:</span> to which purpose, I <span class="hi2">passe</span> all my Muskettiers to the <span class="hi2">right flanke.</span> The words of direction for it, are these.

The first is for the outmost file to give <span class="hi2">fire,</span> and stand untill the next file have fired, which by some is called the <span class="hi2">gathering firing.</span> Secondly, <span class="hi2">firings</span> in <span class="hi2">flanke,</span> and <span class="hi2">leading</span> them up, between the Muskettiers and Pikes <span class="hi2">firing;</span> in <span class="hi2">flanke,</span> being <span class="hi2">led off</span> <span class="pb">227 @tcp:1160:130</span> by the <span class="hi2">bringers up: firings</span> in <span class="hi2">flanke, sleeving up</span> on the contrary <span class="hi2">flanke</span> of Pikes: <span class="hi2">firing</span> in <span class="hi2">flanke,</span> and drawing them up betweene the <span class="hi2">innermost files</span> of Pikes.

                  <p class="p"><span class="pb">228 @tcp:1160:131</span> This kinde of <span class="hi2">firing</span> on the flanke, I have seene and knowne used, by many good and able souldiers. Neverthelesse, in my opinion, the men stand in a great deale of danger, when
                     having <span class="hi2">given fire,</span> they can doe no good; but stand like so many markes for their <span class="hi2">enemies</span> shot. Notwithstanding, it may be that such whom I have frequently seene to use it
                     in their practise, may be able to render good reasons for the <span class="hi2">service;</span> though as yet I cannot conceive it. I will therefore surcease any further prosecution my opinions, and shew the manner of execution: which is to be performed as followeth. The Command being, to <span class="hi2">give fire to the right,</span> presently the <span class="hi2">outermost file</span> to the <span class="hi2">right, faceth</span> outward, and <span class="hi2">presents:</span> the rest of the <span class="hi2">body,</span> still <span class="hi2">marching</span> forwards. Then the <span class="hi2">presented file, gives fire,</span> and <span class="hi2">stands facing</span> againe to their first front. By thattime, the <span class="hi2">body</span> will be marched cleere of the <span class="hi2">standing file,</span> then the next <span class="hi2">outermost file, presents</span> and <span class="hi2">fires;</span> in like manner: the <span class="hi2">body marching</span> as before. Having fired, they in like manner <span class="hi2">face</span> to their first front, and <span class="hi2">stand;</span> a <span class="hi2">Serjeant</span> leading up the file, that first fired on the <span class="hi2">out side</span> of the file that last fired. Then they both <span class="hi2">stand</span> together, untill the third file hath <span class="hi2">given fire</span> after the same manner. And then the <span class="hi2">Serjeant</span> leads up the two files, even with the third, which last fired. And after this manner,
                     the <span class="gap1"><span class="desc">•••</span></span>es of Muskettiers <span class="hi2">face</span> to the flanke: and give fire, s<span class="gap1"><span class="desc">•</span></span>c<span class="gap1"><span class="desc">•</span></span>essively: and stand, untill the <span class="hi2">Serjeant</span> leads up the rest of the files which fired, <span class="hi2">even</span> with the <span class="hi2">front</span> of the file, which last fired. Thus having all fired <span class="pb">229 @tcp:1160:131</span> over, they are to <span class="hi2">march up</span> againe, <span class="hi2">even</span> with the <span class="hi2">front</span> of Pikes, and this <span class="hi2">reduceth</span> them, as at first.

                     it be sutable to your likings, that I <span class="hi2">reduce firings</span> by <span class="hi2">firings:</span> sometimes <span class="hi2">giving fire</span> upon a <span class="hi2">march:</span> sometimes upon a <span class="hi2">stand:</span> sometimes, to the <span class="hi2">front</span> and <span class="hi2">reere;</span> sometimes, to both <span class="hi2">flanks.</span> I do the rather desire to go on in this way, because thereby I may expresse farre more matter,
                     in fewer lines and shorter time.

Its chiefe use, is for the <span class="hi2">entertainment</span> of some great <span class="hi2">personage</span> or <span class="hi2">Commander</span> in the <span class="hi2">field:</span> who being received into the <span class="hi2">midst</span> of the <span class="hi2">divisions</span> of <span class="hi2">Pikes;</span> the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers</span> may <span class="hi2">present</span> and <span class="hi2">give fire,</span> altogether in one <span class="hi2">vollie.</span> Or if they would have the <span class="hi2">Muskettiers give fire,</span> one after another; then the <span class="hi2">vollies</span> by <span class="hi2">succession</span> (which some call the <span class="hi2">Peale)</span> will be the best. If there be more <span class="hi2">Muskettiers,</span> then will serve to make up the <span class="hi2">figure</span> single; they may also <span class="hi2">give fire</span> with the rest: <span class="hi2">presenting obliquely</span> betweene the <span class="hi2">distance</span> of their <span class="hi2">leaders.</span> The way to make this <span class="hi2">figure,</span> is as followeth. First, <span class="hi2">draw forth</span> the <span class="hi2">outmost files</span> (of <span class="hi2">Muskettiers)</span> on each <span class="hi2">flanke,</span> in <span class="hi2">forme</span> of an <span class="hi2">hollow wedge,</span> before the front of <span class="hi2">pikes.</span> Then, cause the <span class="hi2">next two outmost files,</span> to <span class="hi2">face about;</span> and to follow their <span class="hi2">bringers up,</span> in the same <span class="hi2">forme</span> to the <span class="hi2">Reere.</span> Then, let the <span class="hi2">last two files</span> of <span class="hi2">Muskettiers</span> (on each <span class="hi2">flanke)</span> be <span class="hi2">drawne</span> after their <span class="hi2">file-leaders,</span> in the same manner and <span class="hi2">forme,</span> to the <span class="hi2">flanks.</span> The Muskettiers being thus <span class="hi2">ordered,</span> and all <span class="hi2">presented obliquely outwards,</span> command the <span class="hi2">two first,</span> and <span class="hi2">two last ranks</span> of Pikes, to stand; the rest of the Pikes, to <span class="hi2">face</span> to the <span class="pb">267 @tcp:1160:150</span> <span class="hi2">right</span> and <span class="hi2">left:</span> and so to <span class="hi2">march,</span> untill they are <span class="hi2">cleare</span> off the other <span class="hi2">pikes</span> which <span class="hi2">stand.</span> Then, command the Pikes which <span class="hi2">moved,</span> to <span class="hi2">double</span> their <span class="hi2">files</span> to the <span class="hi2">right.</span> Lastly, command all the Pike-men to <span class="hi2">face outward;</span> each <span class="hi2">division</span> of <span class="hi2">Pikes,</span> after their <span class="hi2">hollow</span> <span class="gap1"><span class="desc">〈◊〉</span></span> of <span class="hi2">Muskettiers.</span> Or else, let them <span class="hi2">face</span> all <span class="hi2">inward</span> to the <span class="hi2">Center<span class="g2">▪</span></span> and then the <span class="hi2">Body</span> will stand in <span class="hi2">forme</span> of the following <span class="hi2">figure.</span></p> <span class="figure2"></span> 
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">268 @tcp:1160:151</span> Having fired upon this figure, there is no manner of <span class="hi2">wheeling off:</span> because the <span class="hi2">forme</span> is still to be continued. But when you come to <span class="hi2">reducement,</span> first <span class="hi2">face</span> all the Pikes to their <span class="hi2">proper front,</span> (that is, unto the place, where you finde the <span class="hi2">proper file-leaders.</span> Secondly, let the Pikes which are <span class="hi2">flankers, double</span> their rankes to the <span class="hi2">left:</span> and so <span class="hi2">close</span> their <span class="hi2">divisions.</span> Then the Pikes will be <span class="hi2">reduced.</span> For the Muskettiers, first command those on the flanke, to <span class="hi2">leade up</span> their files in their due places, close to the Pikes. Next, command the Muskettiers
                  of the <span class="hi2">reere,</span> to <span class="hi2">sleeve</span> up on each flanke by <span class="hi2">division.</span> Lastly, command the Muskettiers before the <span class="hi2">front</span> of Pikes, to <span class="hi2">face</span> after their <span class="hi2">bringers up,</span> and to <span class="hi2">march</span> downe into their places. Lastly <span class="hi2">facing</span> to their <span class="hi2">leader,</span> they are all reduced, as at first.

The first, when the Muskettiers give fire, and then place themselves in the <span class="hi2">reere</span> of their <span class="hi2">owne divisions</span> of Muskets. The second way is, after that they have fired, to place them in the <span class="hi2">reere</span> of their Pikes: the Pikes maintaining the Muskettiers <span class="hi2">ground.</span> The words of Command which produce the Figure, are as followeth.

                  advantage, to breake their order by entring at any of the <span class="hi2">Angles,</span> they are speedily to <span class="hi2">cast up a Rampart of earth,</span> in each of those parts of the Angles. Or if they have not time, (or that the ground
                  be not fit) they may supply that defect by placing some of their Wagons, Carts, or other of their Carriage,
                  so orderly, that it may be sufficient to fortifie those parts, which are the weakest.
                  This Figure, may be as well made with the Pikes foremost: but because that the Musketiers may more commodiously <span class="hi2">fight</span> before their Pikes, and with <span class="hi2">lesse danger</span> to their owne <span class="hi2">body:</span> therefore I conceive it fittest, at first to place them in <span class="hi2">front</span> of their Pikes.

For better satisfaction, observe the <span class="hi2">direction</span> to make the following Figure.
