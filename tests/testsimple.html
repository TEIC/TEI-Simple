            <p class="p">THere are <span class="hi2">Three</span> most undoing Mischiefs, which Threaten my Countrey with Grievous Confusions, yea, there are <span class="hi2">Four</span> Evils that have a dire Aspect upon us, boding of something like Barbarism, and Extinction,
               unless the plentiful Effusions of the <span class="hi2">Good Spirit</span> from on High, relieve the Inconveniencies of our <span class="hi2">Wilderness.</span> The first is, The Neglect and Contempt of a well-form'd <span class="hi2">Education,</span> appearing in a backwardness to Encourage Schools of Learning; and a Disposition unto a way
               of Living so scattered, as that it may be called, <span class="hi2">A Running wild into the Woods.</span> The second is, The slothful, careless, quarrelsome Delay of <span class="hi2">Destitute Churches,</span> to furnish themselves with Officers appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ, for their Edification; by
               which Omission, Plantations quickly become full, either of, <span class="hi2">Sinners pining away in their Iniquities,</span> or of, <span class="hi2">Christians plagu'd with Leanness sent into their Soul.</span> The Third is, the <span class="hi2">Crime</span> of <span class="hi2">Ingratitude</span> unto <span class="hi2">Publick Servants</span>; and <span class="pb"></span> the making of Censure, Slander and Hatred, the <span class="hi2">Common P<span class="gap1">••</span></span> of such as with most <span class="hi2">In<span class="gap1">••</span> olate Integrity,</span> seek the <span class="hi2">Common Good</span>: which <span class="hi2">Unthankfulness,</span> will at last make our <span class="hi2">Times Perillous,</span> because it will render us <span class="hi2">Friendless</span> and <span class="hi2">Helpless.</span> But the <span class="hi2">Fourth,</span> and <span class="hi2">worst</span> of all, is the lamentable want of REGENERATION in the <span class="hi2">Rising Generation.</span> The God of Heaven is with no less Terrible than Evident Blows, from Heaven, Rebuking of that <span class="hi2">Generation</span>; but alas, how few of them do seriously consider on the Condition of their own <span class="hi2">Souls</span>! How few of them do suitably Re<span class="gap1">••</span>ect on the <span class="hi2">End</span> for which God at first <span class="hi2">Made</span> them, or for which He now <span class="hi2">Smites</span> them! How few of them do become experimentally Acquainted with that <span class="hi2">Faith,</span> and <span class="hi2">Repentance,</span> and <span class="hi2">Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord</span>! It is indeed a matter of Exceeding <span class="hi2">Joy,</span> that there are, <span class="hi2">so many</span> of our Young Ones, that have their Faces Zion ward; but it is of all <span class="hi2">Grie<span class="gap1">••</span></span> the mo<span class="gap1">•</span>t bitter and pungent, that there are, <span class="hi2">No more.</span> The obtaining of a Cure for <span class="hi2">this</span> wre<span class="gap1">•</span>chedness would be to Redress all <span class="hi2">the rest,</span> and it would contribute more than any <span class="hi2">One Thing</span> whatever, to, <span class="hi2">All Things Going Well.</span> Now there are Two Things, for which I take the Boldness, to Publish my <span class="hi2">Wishes,</span> in order thereunto. The <span class="hi2">One</span> is, That all our Congregations would <span class="hi2">oftner</span> <span class="pb"></span> do what <span class="hi2">some</span> of them have <span class="hi2">sometimes</span> done, in setting apart whole <span class="hi2">Dayes</span> for Fasting and Prayer before the Lord, that his Powerful <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> may multiply sincere and thorough Conversions in the <span class="hi2">Rising Generation.</span> The <span class="hi2">Other</span> is, That the most Faithful, and Pious <span class="hi2">Ministers</span> of the Gospel wherewith our God has blessed us, would, as He shall give them Opportunity,
               personally visit all the Families in their Flocks; and in those Visits, most affectionately
               Address the <span class="hi2">Rising Generation,</span> upon the Nature and Necessity of that <span class="hi2">Conversion,</span> which in their Publick Ministry is press'd upon them.
            </p>
            <p class="p">'Tis in the pursuance of <span class="hi2"><span class="gap1">•</span>is</span> Design, that I have here printed the Notes of two or three Sermons upon <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> Preached almost <span class="hi2">seven</span> years ago; accompany'd with two or three more since Delivered: hoping that the <span class="hi2">Young,</span> may give a particular Attention to <span class="hi2">One</span> who so belonged unto their <span class="hi2">Generation.</span> I make not a large Impression to ask <span class="hi2">Readers,</span> abroad in the World: I have already done <span class="hi2">enough,</span> and it may be too much of that; but I was willing to be furnished at least with so
               many Copies, as might serve me, with Gods permission, to Leave one in <span class="hi2">every House</span> of the Dear People, whom He has commanded me to treat about, <span class="hi2">The Things of their Eternal Peace.</span> Briefly, The Book is <span class="hi2">Printed,</span> but I can <span class="pb"></span> hardly say, 'tis <span class="hi2">published.</span> Doubtless the World Rings, with the Noise of a strange Descent, which the <span class="hi2">Devils</span> have lately made upon several parts of this Land, wherein those <span class="hi2">Evil Spirits,</span> have horribly Tortured, Wounded, Scalded, and with a Thousand sensible and exquisite
               Cruelties, been trying to Dragoon our poor people, into their Services; which those <span class="hi2">Filthy Spectres</span> propound, with laying before them the Shape of a BOOK to be by them Entertained. Now,
               among the Engines to oppose the <span class="hi2">Devils</span> Interests, there is also no little use to be made of, BOOKS; first, that <span class="hi2">Book of Books,</span> the BIBLE; and then such other <span class="hi2">Books,</span> as are to Explain the <span class="hi2">Lively Oracles</span> of <span class="hi2">That.</span> Among those <span class="hi2">Books,</span> I have here endeavoured ONE more; whereof I would only say thus much; <span class="hi2">Reader,</span> if thou canst ever be concerned about a more Important Subject than what is here handled, I am content, that THIS BOOK should never
               come into thy Hand: But if it come into thy <span class="hi2">Hand,</span> Let the Desires of an Awakened Soul accompany it, that it may come <span class="gap1">•••</span>thy <span class="hi2">Heart</span>; and that both our Names may be Written in the <span class="hi2">Lambs Book of Life.</span></p>

            <p class="p">TWere more charitable to <span class="hi2">Bewayl</span> it, than it looks Uncharitably to <span class="hi2">Suspect</span> it, that our <span class="hi2">Countrey</span> is become like that <span class="hi2">Valley,</span> whereof we Read in <span class="hi2">Ezek.</span> 37.1, 2. That it was, <span class="hi2">A Valley full of Bones, that were very dry.</span> The <span class="hi2">Dry Bones</span> there, are too like the <span class="hi2">Dead Souls</span> here; the Subjects of the Blackest Calamities, the Objects of the greatest Compassions,
               because of their Estrangement from Him, <span class="hi2">Whom to know is Life Eternal.</span> Our Land is in the Divine Dispensations dealt withal as if it were <span class="hi2">Unclean,</span> &amp; is it not the multitude of, <span class="hi2">The Dead,</span> among us, that makes it so?

               may fear whether we are not under a plague beyond that of <span class="hi2">Egypt,</span> when there was <span class="hi2">One <span class="pb">2</span> Dead in every House,</span> And now what shall be done for them?

A Person of some Estate and Figure among the <span class="hi2">Jews,</span> who, as if having some Interest among the <span class="hi2">Greeks</span> also, was named <span class="hi2">Nicodemus</span> (by his own people pronounced <span class="hi2">Nacdimon</span>) gave a visit by Night unto our Lord Jesus Christ. Although his dread of a Disreputation, <span class="pb">3</span> and perhaps an Excommunication, among the <span class="hi2">Builders</span> which refused, <span class="hi2">That <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> Corner <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>,</span> caused him to Address our <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>, <span class="hi2">By Night</span>; yet in that Address, he Acknowledged, <span class="hi2">We know that thou art a Teacher come from God.</span> Our Lord hereupon gi<span class="gap1">•</span>es Hi<span class="gap1">•</span> a <span class="hi2">Lesson</span> worthy of such a <span class="hi2">Teacher</span>; w<span class="gap1">•</span>ich Lesson was the Sentence now before u<span class="gap1">•</span>; and He does therein intimate that a <span class="hi2">New birth</span> would have Enabled him to be sensible of our Lords being somewhat more than a meer <span class="hi2">Teacher,</span> or Prophet a<span class="gap1">•</span>isen to the Church: indeed of His being no less than the <span class="hi2">Only Begotten Son of God.</span> The Jews were not Ignorant, that the <span class="hi2">Messiah</span> would con<span class="gap1">•</span>er upon His People, <span class="hi2">A Kingdom which was to be for ever and ever</span>: Not only <span class="hi2">Daniel,</span> but even <span class="hi2">All the Prophets</span> as it were with one <span class="hi2">mouth,</span> had given them Assurance of it; and there were especially two very common Maxims about
               that <span class="hi2">Kingdom</span> among them, whereto our Lord seems to refer in his <span class="hi2">Answer</span> to <span class="hi2">Nicodemus,</span> who probably from some Discourse in the <span class="hi2">Sanhedrim</span> the Day before, might bring to our Lord some Enquiries thereupon. It was an Oracle among them, <span class="hi2">Paenitentia est ad Messiae Receptionem Necessaria</span>; that is, we must <span class="hi2">Repent</span> of our Sins, if we would <span class="hi2">Receive</span> our <span class="hi2">Messiah.</span> This does our Lord seem to Approve; and he bids us, by the <span class="hi2">New birth of Repentance</span> to prepare our <span class="pb">4</span> selves, that so we may partake in, <span class="hi2">The Times of Refreshing by the presence of the Lord.</span> It was likewise an Opinion among them, <span class="hi2">Universo Israeli est portio in mundo futuro</span>; that is, All the <span class="hi2">Children</span> of <span class="hi2">Israel</span> shall be Advanced in the Kingdom of the <span class="hi2">Messiah.</span> This our Lord seems to Reprove, advising us, that it is not being the Children of
               any Earthly Parent, but it is only a <span class="hi2">New birth,</span> which will Entitle any of us to Happiness in the <span class="hi2">World to come.</span></p>
            <p class="p">In the Text which thus falls into our Hands, there is first, An <span class="hi2">Affirmation</span>; a most Solemn and Awful Assertion delivered by <span class="hi2">Him that cannot Ly.</span> It is, <span class="hi2">Except a man be Born again.</span>] Some Read it, <span class="hi2">Born from Above.</span> But for the <span class="hi2">Translation</span> of this Clause, tho' not for the clear and full <span class="hi2">Signification</span> of it, we may allow <span class="hi2">Nicodemus</span> himself to be our Interpreter; to be, <span class="hi2">Born Again,</span> is to be, <span class="hi2">Born a Second Time.</span> The Name which the Jews did use to put upon a <span class="hi2">Proselyte,</span> namely, <span class="hi2">Recens natus,</span> or, <span class="hi2">A newly-Born Person,</span> seems here transferred unto a further Intent and Purpose, by our Blessed Jesus. <span class="hi2">He cannot see the Kingdom of God.</span>] The <span class="hi2">Vision</span> here imports <span class="hi2">Enjoyment,</span> also; as the like Phrase often occurri<span class="gap1">••</span>, elsewhere makes it Evident; thus among the <span class="hi2">Latines</span> too, <span class="hi2">Cernere Hereditatem,</span> is to <span class="hi2">Enter upon</span> an Inheritance. But mark seriously, the <span class="hi2">Universality</span> of this thing, <span class="hi2">Except a Man</span>] whatever <span class="hi2">Man</span> he be, whether <span class="pb">5</span> Jew or Gentile, whether Mean or Noble, whether Simple or Learned; it is true, of <span class="hi2">any One,</span> of <span class="hi2">every One,</span> whoever that <span class="hi2">One</span> shall be.
            </p>
            <p class="p">There is, Next, <span class="hi2">A Confirmation</span>; and this is with a strong Asseveration. <span class="hi2">Verily, Verily.</span>] The Original here fetches an Adverb, of <span class="hi2">Assuring,</span> and of <span class="hi2">Promising,</span> from the Hebrew Language: it is, as if it had been said, <span class="hi2">The Saying is Faithful &amp; Certain, and shall be brought surely to pass</span>! And the <span class="hi2">Verity</span> of this position, like <span class="hi2">Pharaohs</span> Dream of old, is Repeated; because the Thing indeed is <span class="hi2">No Dream</span>; no, <span class="hi2">The Thing is Established by God.</span> Hereunto our Lord adds, <span class="hi2">I say unto thee</span>] Who is that <span class="hi2">I</span>? To make a a just Paraphrase thereupon; 'Tis that <span class="hi2">I,</span> who ever <span class="hi2">speaks in Righteousness</span>; that <span class="hi2">I, Who is the Way, the Truth and the Life</span>: that <span class="hi2">I,</span> who is the <span class="hi2">Judge of Quick and of Dead</span>; and if such an One as <span class="hi2">He,</span> say it, who dares to doubt it!
            </p>
            <p class="p">Wherefore the All-concerning DOCTRINE, which now calls for our <span class="hi2">Earnest Heed,</span> is this: <span class="hi2">That without Regeneration men cannot Enjoy the Kingdom of God</span></p>
            <p class="p">One of the Ancients wisely engraved that <span class="pb">6</span> Motto upon his Table, <span class="hi2">No Back-biter is to be Entertained here.</span> But behold the Motto, which the Eternal God has Inscribed upon His Kingdom, <span class="hi2">No <span class="gap1">•</span>an shall enjoy this, but he that is Born Again!</span> And now, may my God help me to <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> His Truth, with such <span class="hi2">Right Words,</span> as thro<span class="gap1">•</span> the Co<span class="gap1">•</span>operations of His Grace, may be <span class="hi2">Forceable,</span> upon all your souls; <span class="hi2">May the Lord God of my Master send me good speed this Day!</span></p>
            <p class="p">That we may Think distinctly, let this be,</p>
            <div class="div">
               <h2 class="head">The First PROPOSITION.</h2>
               <p class="p">There is a REGENERATION, or <span class="hi2">New Birth,</span> which the Elect of God, before their <span class="hi2">Death,</span> must have Experience of. This is one of the Links, in that which has of old been called, <span class="hi2">The Golden Chain of Salvation; Rom.</span> 8.30. <span class="hi2">Whom He did Predestinate, them He also Called</span>; that is, he makes them Effectually to hear- that <span class="hi2">voice</span> of his, whereby they are <span class="hi2">Born A<span class="gap1">•</span>gain. Predestination</span> and <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> are the things which <span class="hi2">God hath Joyned:</span> it will be to the mans own Everlasting Ruine if any man go to <span class="hi2">Put them asunder.</span> We may be sure that, <span class="hi2">As many as are Ordained to Eternal Life,</span> will by a <span class="hi2">Spiritual Birth</span> be made capable for the Fruition of it. But what means that? <span class="hi2">How can a man be Born when He is Old?</span></p>
               <p class="p">I Confess that as in <span class="hi2">Glorification,</span> so in <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> <span class="pb">7</span> there are, <span class="hi2">Unutterable Things</span>: 'tis Consisting of, and Surrounded with <span class="hi2">Invisibles.</span> That Unaccountable Thing which is in <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> bestow'd upon us, is called, in 1 <span class="hi2">Pet.</span> 3.4. <span class="hi2">The Hidden Man of the Heart.</span> What the Wise man says, about <span class="hi2">Generation,</span> may be said about <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> too, <span class="hi2">We know not the way of the Spirit in us</span>! Concerning <span class="hi2">both,</span> it was the Language of the Psalmist, and it may be ours, <span class="hi2">We are fearfully and wonderfully made</span>! Rude Pagans, 'tis true, have had their dark Notion, about, a, <span class="hi2">Renascentia,</span> or a <span class="hi2">New-Birth,</span> in their Philosophy: but how short were their Conceptions as to the <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> and the <span class="hi2">New-Birth</span> in Christianity? That may be said of the <span class="hi2">New-Birth,</span> which has been said of the <span class="hi2">New Name,</span> in Rev. 2.17. <span class="hi2">No man knows it, except he that Receiveth it.</span> And yet it is hard, even for such a man to <span class="hi2">Say,</span> what he does <span class="hi2">Know</span> about, such a <span class="hi2">marvellous work of God.</span> However, Let this be offered as a small Description of it. REGENERATION, <span class="hi2">is a Real and Thorough Change, wrought by the Holy Spirit, in a Fallen Man, through the Infusion of
                     a Gracious Principle into him, which Restores in him, the Lost Image of God, and therewithal
                     Inclines him to comply with the Calls of the Gospel.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Behold, what Conclusions we are to make.</p>
               <p class="p">I. There is a <span class="hi2">Real</span> &amp; a <span class="hi2">Thorough</span> CHANGE <span class="pb">8</span> wrought in every <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> Man. Indeed the <span class="hi2">Substance</span> of one Soul is not Removed or Dissolved in <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> and the <span class="hi2">Substance</span> of an other Introduced, as the Jews fondly fancy'd. The <span class="hi2">Being</span> of our Soul is not scattered, but the <span class="hi2">Crookedness</span> and <span class="hi2">Wickedness</span> thereof is Rectify'd, in <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span>; the Metal of the Soul re<span class="gap1">•••</span>ns <span class="hi2">Old</span> for the <span class="hi2">Sort</span> of it, but becomes <span class="hi2">New</span> for the <span class="hi2">Stamp</span> of it; nor is a <span class="hi2">New Faculty</span> added unto the Soul, but a <span class="hi2">New Quality</span> unto the Faculty. Thus in <span class="hi2">Ezek.</span> 36.26. a <span class="hi2">New Heart,</span> and a <span class="hi2">New Spirit,</span> is ascribed unto the <span class="hi2">New-born</span> Man; but how? As we Read of <span class="hi2">New Tongues,</span> and <span class="hi2">New M<span class="gap1">•</span>ons,</span> which mean only a <span class="hi2">New Speech,</span> and a <span class="hi2">Ne<span class="gap1">•</span> Light</span> ado<span class="gap1">•</span>ning of the old: But yet, a Mighty <span class="hi2">Cha<span class="gap1">•</span>ge</span> is undergone by the <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> Man; he is <span class="hi2">born again,</span> that is, he is one come into another world, and has another way of Living in that world, than before; he is, as we find him called, in Eph.
                  4.23. <span class="hi2">A Renewed Man.</span></p>
               <p class="p">First, It is a REAL <span class="hi2">Change,</span> that the <span class="hi2">Regenerate Man</span> has pass'd upon him. 'Tis not meerly a <span class="hi2">Relative</span> Change; and so the Change in <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> differs from that in <span class="hi2">Justification.</span> In one there is a Change of <span class="hi2">Estate,</span> in t'other a change of <span class="hi2">Temper.</span> In <span class="hi2">that,</span> the <span class="hi2">Guilt</span> of Sin is Blotted out; in <span class="hi2">this,</span> the the <span class="hi2">Filth</span> of Sin is wash'd away. <span class="hi2">That</span> is a <span class="hi2">Sentence</span> on the Sinner; like that in 2 Sam. <span class="pb">9</span> 12.13. <span class="hi2">The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not dy. This</span> is a <span class="hi2">Filling</span> of the Sinner; as we may read, Eph. 2.1. <span class="hi2">You hath he filled, who were Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</span> Nor is it meerly a <span class="hi2">Nominal</span> or a <span class="hi2">Notional</span> Change: 'tis no Brain-sick Imagination. We have one picture of this Change drawn from <span class="hi2">Inanimate</span> Things; in Isa. 55.13. <span class="hi2">Instead of the Thorn, shall come up the Fir tree, and instead of the Briar, shall
                     come up the Myrtle-tree.</span> We have another shadow of this Change, fetch'd from <span class="hi2">Animate</span> Things; in Isa. 11.6. <span class="hi2">The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid.</span> In <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> thus it is; the man varies from what once he was, as much as a <span class="hi2">Fir</span> from a <span class="hi2">Thorn,</span> as much as a <span class="hi2">Lamb</span> from a <span class="hi2">Wolf</span>! Thus, One of the Primitive Christians, after his Conversion, being met by an Idolater of his old Acquaintance, had that Salutation from him, <span class="hi2">Ego Sum,</span> Sir, 'tis <span class="hi2">I</span>? whereupon he Reply'd, <span class="hi2">At Ego non sum Ego</span>; But Sir, <span class="hi2">'Tis not I</span>; I am not the man I was. We may therefore add,
               </p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, It is a THOROUGH <span class="hi2">Change</span> that passes upon the <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> Man. <span class="hi2">Of</span> and <span class="hi2">by</span> such a man, 'tis said in 2 Cor. 5.17. <span class="hi2">Old things are past away, behold, all things are become New</span>; as the <span class="hi2">Conflagration</span> at th<span class="gap1">•</span> Last Day, will bring a New Face upon the <span class="hi2">Great World</span>; so does a <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> at this <span class="pb">10</span> Day upon the <span class="hi2">Small.</span> As the <span class="hi2">Light</span> fills all the Air, as the <span class="hi2">Leaven</span> spreads all the Lump, or, in a word, as <span class="hi2">Original Sin</span> reaches to the whole man; so <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> has its Influences upon every <span class="hi2">part</span> of the m<span class="gap1">•</span>n, that becomes the Subject of i<span class="gap1">•</span>; altho' the Influence wi<span class="gap1">••</span> <span class="gap1">•</span>e but <span class="hi2">in part,</span> until we do in Glo<span class="gap1">•</span>y Arrive <span class="gap1">•</span>o, <span class="hi2">The Stature of a perfect man.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Particularly; <span class="hi2">A Regenerate</span> Man has <span class="hi2">New</span> ABILITIES conferred on him. While he was <span class="hi2">Ungodly,</span> he was, <span class="hi2">Without Strength</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> but now he may joyfully say, <span class="hi2">Lord, th<span class="gap1">•</span>u hast strengthened me with strength in my so<span class="gap1">•</span>l <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span></span> thing that may be s<span class="gap1">•</span>oken by a Regene<span class="gap1">•••</span>e man is that in <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 9.23. <span class="hi2">Whereas I w<span class="gap1">•</span>s Blind, now</span> I SEE. There is an <span class="hi2">Illumination</span> in <span class="hi2">Regeneration.</span> The man comes to see an Infinite Glory in GOD; though once he had <span class="gap1">•</span>ai<span class="gap1">•</span>, <span class="hi2">Wh<span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="gap1">•</span>s the Lord, that</span> I <span class="hi2">should Serve Him?</span> He <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> to see a singular Beauty in CHRI<span class="gap1">••</span>; though once he had said, <span class="hi2">There is no <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> in Him, for wh<span class="gap1">•</span>ch</span> I <span class="hi2">should Desire Him.</span> He comes to see a wonderful Evil in SIN; though once he had said, <span class="hi2">Sto <span class="gap1">••</span>n Waters are sweet.</span> He now sees an Ungainsayable Equity in RELIGION; tho' formerly he had said, I <span class="hi2">desire not the knowledge of the Ways of the Almighty</span>! He sees now an unspeakable Honor in HELL, tho' heretofore he counted the <span class="hi2">Darts of God but Stubble.</span> He see<span class="gap1">•</span> now an inef<span class="gap1">••</span>ble pleasure <span class="pb">17</span> in HEAVEN, tho' heretofore he <span class="hi2">Despised that good land of promise.</span> And he now sees Dreadful miseries upon HIMSELF; tho' heretofore he still said, <span class="hi2">I have need of Nothing</span>! Another thing that may be spoken by a regenerate man is that in <span class="hi2">Phil.</span> 4.13. <span class="hi2">I Can</span> DO <span class="hi2">all things through Christ who strengthens me.</span> Tis by Regeneration that a man who look'd upon Exercises of <span class="hi2">Piety</span> and <span class="hi2">Charity,</span> as Intolerable, Insuperable, Impracticable, now comes to say, <span class="hi2">Lord, thy Commandments are not grievous</span>! Altho' he be more sensible of his own <span class="hi2">weakness</span> than ever he was; yet he more finds, <span class="hi2">The Grace of God sufficient for him.</span> There are those which Once he Counted, <span class="hi2">Hard Sayings,</span> in the Lawes of God; but now with Gods help he can Do the things required in Gods
                  word. Has God commanded him, To <span class="hi2">Do JUSTICE</span> and <span class="hi2">Love MERCY,</span> and <span class="hi2">Walk HUMBLY</span>? He Does it. Has God commanded him, to Live <span class="hi2">Soberly,</span> and <span class="hi2">Righteously,</span> and <span class="hi2">Godlily</span>? he Does it. Yea, Has God bidden him, to pluck out a <span class="hi2">Right Eye,</span> and cut off a <span class="hi2">Right Hand?</span> He Does it, by the Assistance of him that has Bidden it; He that was once a creeple,
                  now not only <span class="hi2">WALKS in the way that is called Holy,</span> but even <span class="hi2">RUNS with patience the Race that is set before him,</span></p>
               <p class="p">Again, A <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> man has <span class="hi2">New</span> APPETITES breathing in him. Once indeed he <span class="hi2">Drank in Iniquity Like water</span>; but there is now another sort of Rellish in the Soul of him. <span class="pb">12</span> The WILL of a Regenerate man, comes to make that choice, in Psal. 73.25. <span class="hi2">Whom have I in Heaven, but thee, O Lord! and there is none upon Earth, that</span> I <span class="hi2">desire besides thee.</span> Formerly, it he had been asked, <span class="hi2">What will satisfie th<span class="gap1">•</span>e</span>? he would have itched upon a Long <span class="hi2">Life</span> in this World, <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> with all the <span class="hi2">Pleasures</span> and <span class="hi2">Pr<span class="gap1">••</span>its</span> and <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> of it. But now he is no more so <span class="hi2">Selfish,</span> so Idolatrous and Atheistical. The chief <span class="gap1">•</span>ND, which he now chooses, is, <span class="hi2">That the Eternal God may by and from him have Eternal Ac<span class="gap1">•</span>n<span class="gap1">•</span>wl<span class="gap1">•</span>dgments.</span> And the MEANS, which he chooses for this <span class="hi2">End,</span> are, <span class="hi2">An Acquaintance with, and Obedience to, the Lord Jesus Christ, in all the Methods
                     directed by the Scriptures of Truth.</span> When the God of Heaven propounds unto this man, as he did unto <span class="hi2">Solomon, Ask, what I shall give thee</span>: 'tis nothing short of Heaven, that will content him: and he cordially takes and
                  likes that Appropriation of God upon him, <span class="hi2">This man have</span> I <span class="hi2">formed for my self, he shall shew forth my praise.</span> Those little <span class="hi2">Designs,</span> and sorry <span class="hi2">Delights,</span> which the most of men do basely take up wi<span class="gap1">•</span>hal, become very contemptible to the Soul of such a man; and he heartily closes with it as his main business in the world, <span class="hi2">By Repenting and Believing, to make sure of Everlasting Happiness, and in the continual Exercise of Religion, to bear Testimonies
                     unto the Truths and Ways of our Maker.</span> We may add, That the <span class="pb">13</span> AFFECTIONS of a Regenerate Man are such as Enable him to comply with that Rule, in
                  Rom. 12.9. <span class="hi2">Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.</span> His LOVE once was of those <span class="hi2">Abominable Things, which the Soul of the Lord Hateth.</span> But now he says, <span class="hi2">I Love thee, O Lord my Strength</span>! now he says, <span class="hi2">Oh! how</span> I <span class="hi2">Love thy Law</span>! now he says, <span class="hi2">I have Loved the Habitation of thy House,</span> and unto this he joyns, <span class="hi2">The L<span class="gap1">•</span>w of the Brethren</span>! His HOPE, once was only of <span class="hi2">Goods laid up for many years</span>; and all that while he was indeed, <span class="hi2">Without Hope.</span> But now his <span class="hi2">Hope</span> is, <span class="hi2">For thy Salvation, O Lord</span>! And his <span class="hi2">Fear</span> is, <span class="hi2">Lest</span> I <span class="hi2">fall short of Entring into Rest.</span> His JOY, was once only in the, <span class="hi2">Increase of Corn and Wine</span>: but now 'tis, <span class="hi2">In the Light of Gods Countenance.</span> And his <span class="hi2">Grief</span> is broached, by that Reflection, <span class="hi2">My Iniquities have separated between me and my God</span>; and that, <span class="hi2">My Trespasses have pierced my Saviour</span>; and that, <span class="hi2">By my Sins I have wronged my own Soul.</span> And what are his Desires now, but an, <span class="hi2">Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness</span>?
               </p>
               <p class="p">Furthermore, a <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> man has <span class="hi2">New</span> EMPLOYMENTS followed by him. It might indeed be said unto him. <span class="hi2">You were the Servant of Sin</span>: but he is now vigorously Engag'd in the Service of another Lord: his Character is that in <span class="hi2">Psal.</span> 119.38. Lord, <span class="hi2">Thy Servant, Devoted unto thy Fear.</span> <span class="pb">14</span> As to the SPIRIT of the Regenerate man, that is otherwise Employ'd than once it was.
                  The <span class="hi2">Thoughts</span> that formerly swarmed in him, were <span class="hi2"><span class="gap1">•</span>arthly, Sensual, Devillish</span>; but now he can say, <span class="hi2">How precious are thy Thoughts unto me, O Lord</span>! His <span class="hi2">Meditations</span> upon God, and the Words and Works, of that Great God, are <span class="hi2">sweet</span> unto him. And his <span class="hi2">Contrivances</span> are, <span class="hi2">What shall I do to b<span class="gap1">•</span> Saved</span>? and, <span class="hi2">How may I bring forth much of that Fruit, whereby my Heavenly Father may be Glorified</span>? The BODY of a Regenerate man, <span class="hi2">that</span> also is Employ'd more Nobly, more Holily, more Divinely, than heretofore, when its Members
                  were, <span class="hi2">The <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> of Unrighteousness.</span> May we a little <span class="hi2">Anatomize</span> this <span class="hi2">New Living</span> Man! His EYES, were once wandring after, <span class="hi2">The <span class="gap1">•</span>us<span class="gap1">•</span> of the Eye:</span> but now he has made a, <span class="hi2">Covenant with his Eyes</span>; now he has his <span class="hi2">Eyes unto the Lord</span>; now, <span class="hi2">Rivers of Waters run down his Eyes,</span> because the <span class="hi2">Law</span> of God is violated. His EARS, were once open unto, <span class="hi2">Rotten Communication</span>; but now those <span class="hi2">Ears</span> have the <span class="hi2">Sayings of Jesus Christ s<span class="gap1">•</span>aking down into them</span>; now his <span class="hi2">Ears</span> will <span class="hi2">Hear what God the Lord will speak</span>; now he has his <span class="hi2">Ears bored unto the Service of God.</span> His TONGUE once was a thing <span class="hi2">Set on Fire of Hell</span>; but now it becomes like <span class="hi2">choice Silver</span> for the <span class="hi2">Truth</span> and <span class="hi2">Worth</span> of the Words proceeding from it; now it <span class="pb">15</span> will utter <span class="hi2">Psalms</span> instead of Ballads, and <span class="hi2">Prayers</span> instead of Swearing and Cursing and Frothy Foolish Ribaldry: Yea, 'tis as the <span class="hi2">Pen of a Ready Writer,</span> when speaking about the King and Kingdom of the Saints. What are his HANDS? not <span class="hi2">The Fists of Wickedness</span>; but <span class="hi2">Lifted up in the Name of God.</span> What are his FEET? not, <span class="hi2">Swift to do Evil</span>; but <span class="hi2">Turned unto the Testimonies of the Lord.</span> In fine, the whole <span class="hi2">Body</span> of this man, becomes a <span class="hi2">Temple</span> to the Holy <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God. And thus is the Regenerate man, all over <span class="hi2">New</span>! But, O make a pause here, and let thy Heart smi<span class="gap1">•</span>e thee, if thou art a stranger to such a <span class="hi2">Renovation.</span> Wee'll then pass to, a Second Conclusion
               </p>
               <p class="p">II. The <span class="hi2">Change</span> wrought in a Regenerate man, proceeds from a Gracious PRINCIPLE, infused from on high into him. Thus we are told, for so <span class="hi2">I</span> would now Read it, in 2 Cor. 5.17. <span class="hi2">If any man be in Christ, there is a New Creature in him.</span> Besides, and beyond all the <span class="hi2">External Alterations</span> undergone by a Regenerate man, there is, <span class="hi2">Aliquid intus Existens,</span> a certain <span class="hi2">something within him,</span> which once he was without; a certain <span class="hi2">Godly Principle,</span> or, <span class="hi2">A Principle of Respect unto God,</span> which the Scripture puts various Names upon. There is the NEW MAN, that is, a new
                  posture of Spirit, in the <span class="pb">16</span> Regenerate man, opposed unto the <span class="hi2">Old man,</span> that is, the old Habit of Sin, and Vice, which he was Born withal. The Regenerate man, has the <span class="hi2">Branches</span> of good Opinions, and good Practices, to be observed in him: but he has in him also a <span class="hi2">gracious Principl<span class="gap1">•</span></span> <span class="g2">▪</span> called by <span class="hi2">Job,</span> in Chap. 19.28. <span class="hi2">The ROOT of the Matter,</span> for them to grow upon. The Regenerate man has the <span class="hi2">Fruits,</span> of which the Spirit of God is the Author; even the <span class="hi2">peaceable Fruits of Righteousness</span>; but he hath also a <span class="hi2">gracious Principle,</span> called by <span class="hi2">John,</span> in 1 Ep. 3.9. <span class="hi2">The SEED of God,</span> from whence they do proceed. The Regenerate man has the <span class="hi2">Streams</span> of much Goodness in his Conversation, whereby is <span class="hi2">made Glad the City of God,</span> which he belongs unto; but the Source of them is a <span class="hi2">gracious Principle,</span> which our Lord calls in Joh. 4.14. <span class="hi2">A WELL of Water springing up to Everlasting Life.</span> The Regenerate man has the <span class="hi2">Light</span> of those <span class="hi2">Good Works,</span> which do so shine before men, as that the <span class="hi2">Heavenly Father is thereby Glorify'd</span>: but the continual supply thereof is from the <span class="hi2">gracious Principle</span> which our Saviour calls, in Mat. 25.4. <span class="hi2">OYL in the Vessel.</span> There is in the Regenerate man, that which is called, in 2 Pet. 1.4. THE DIVINE NATURE;
                  that is, a principle which is <span class="hi2">Divine</span> for the Original of it, and by means whereof all <span class="hi2">Godly Operations</span> <span class="pb">17</span> become <span class="hi2">Natural,</span> or Free, Frequent, Fervent and constant with him that has it. It is not a <span class="hi2">Guilded</span> but a <span class="hi2">Quickned</span> Soul, that is in the Regenerate man; his <span class="hi2">Motion</span> and <span class="hi2">Action</span> arises from a <span class="hi2">Life within</span>; and that <span class="hi2">Life</span> is the Result of his <span class="hi2">Union</span> with the Lord Jesus Christ, who is <span class="hi2">our Life.</span> Poor Soul, see now whether the <span class="hi2">Spirit of Life</span> in the Lord Jesus Christ, have thus Animated thee. Yea, or No? But a Third Conclusion
                  is then to take hold on the Heel of the foregoing.
               </p>
               <p class="p">III. Thro' the <span class="hi2">gracious Principle</span> Infused into the <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> man, the <span class="gap1">•</span>o<span class="gap1">•</span>t IMAGE of God is Restored in him. For this cause we are informed in Col. 3.10. <span class="hi2">The New Man is Renewed after the Image of Him which Created it.</span> In this Lay the Primitive Happiness of man at his Creation; 'tis the Account, which, <span class="hi2">In the Head of Gods Book,</span> is given of it, <span class="hi2">God Created Man in his own Image.</span> But what was that <span class="hi2">Image</span> <span class="gap1">•</span>f God? Briefly, An <span class="hi2">Universal</span> RECTITUDE in the Soul, was the chief Thing, wherein that <span class="hi2">Image</span> lay. Hence we are now told, in Eph. 4.24. <span class="hi2">The new man after God, is Created in Righteousness and true Holiness.</span> Alas, Man by Sin, has lost this glorious <span class="hi2">Image</span>; yea, the <span class="hi2">Image</span> of Satan, instead thereof hath possessed him, and polluted <span class="pb">18</span> him. As a man that is bitten by a <span class="hi2">Mad Dog,</span> horribly <span class="hi2">Barks,</span> and Howls, and Laps, just like the Creature which Envenom'd him; so has the Infection convey'd unto us, by the Breath and Sting of our Tempter, <span class="hi2">The Great Red Old Dragon,</span> fearfu<span class="gap1">•</span>ly assimilated us unto himself. But now <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> happily Recovers in us, the thus Impaired <span class="hi2">Image</span> of God; by defacing the Impressions of Hell that had been made upon us. There is a
                  marvellous <span class="hi2">Agreement</span> now between God and Man; wherein though not the <span class="hi2">Essence,</span> nor the <span class="hi2">Greatness</span> of God, yet a Resemblance of His HOLINESS is in a blessed measure Communicated unto
                  the man thus, <span class="hi2">Born again.</span> It may be said of him, <span class="hi2">He is a man after Gods own Heart</span>; he <span class="hi2">Likes,</span> he <span class="hi2">Loves,</span> he <span class="hi2">Lives</span> after such a manner as to describe unto all serious Beholders, a little of that <span class="hi2">Holiness,</span> which is Infinite in the <span class="hi2">Holy One of Israel.</span> Hence, a Regenerate man studies a most exact Conformity to the Example of the Lord
                  Jesus Christ, and Attains very much of what he studies. As a Renowned Minister could
                  say, <span class="hi2">When I am to Preach a Sermon,</span> I <span class="hi2">set my self to think, How would Jesus Christ Preach, were He to Handle my Subject</span>! So a Regenerate man sometimes thinks, <span class="hi2">How did the Blessed Jesus do such a Duty?</span> or, <span class="hi2">How did the blessed <span class="pb">19</span> Jesus bear such a Trial</span>? and then he endeavours to go <span class="hi2">and do Likewise.</span> A Regenerate man, is a CHRISTIAN in reality; that is, <span class="hi2">A Christ-like man</span>; and it may be said of such ones, <span class="hi2">As thou art, so are they<span class="g2">▪</span> each one Resembling the Children of a King.</span> What shall I say? The view of the Imitable Vertue and Carriage in our Lord Jesus, even <span class="hi2">Transforms</span> the Regenerate man, till he be, <span class="hi2">Changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory.</span> Unto this we will annex but one Conclusion more: and O that you might <span class="hi2">Feel,</span> what you are now to <span class="hi2">Hear.</span></p>
               <p class="p">IV. The Gracious <span class="hi2">Principle,</span> which Restores the <span class="hi2">Image</span> of God, in a <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> man, inclines him to comply with the CALLS of God, in the GOSPEL. Unto all the Evangelical
                  Proposals, the Return of the Regenerate man is not that, <span class="hi2">As for the Word spoken in the Name of the Lord,</span> I <span class="hi2">will not hearken thereunto</span>; no, but it is that, <span class="hi2">Lo,</span> I <span class="hi2">come,</span> I <span class="hi2">delight to do thy Will, O my God.</span> There are especially two things wherein the Calls of the Gospel are summed up unto us; namely, those two, in Acts 20.21. <span class="hi2">Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ</span>: but the Regenerate have the <span class="hi2">Repentance,</span> and the <span class="hi2">Faith,</span> so called for. Such is the REPENTANCE <span class="pb">20</span> of a Regenerate man; that he looks on his manifold sinfulness both by <span class="hi2">Nature</span> and <span class="hi2">Practice,</span> with a thorough <span class="hi2">Conviction</span> of it; and he cries out, <span class="hi2">Lord,</span> I <span class="hi2">am vile</span>: He then mourns for that exceeding sinfulness, and Loathes himself with the <span class="hi2">Contrition,</span> of a <span class="hi2">Rent,</span> a <span class="hi2">Pierc'd,</span> a <span class="hi2">Broken Heart,</span> within him. He therewithal comes to an Ingenuous <span class="hi2">Confession</span> thereof; and Sin becomes as a <span class="hi2">Cup of Trembling,</span> or Poison in his Bowels, which he does <span class="hi2">Cast up,</span> with penitent Acknowledgments, before such as have seen <span class="gap1">•</span>im <span class="hi2">take in</span> the Deadly Poyson. Hereupon, with a just <span class="hi2">Recession</span> from it, he cries out, I <span class="hi2">have do<span class="gap1">••</span> Iniquity, but</span> I <span class="hi2">will do so no more</span>! he sets himself to Mortify every <span class="hi2">Lust,</span> and gives an Everlasting <span class="hi2">Divorce</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> all his former Courses of Ungodliness. Instead thereof, he Devotes himself to God for ever: to the <span class="hi2">Flesh,</span> he says, I <span class="hi2">will no more Humour thee</span>! to the <span class="hi2">World,</span> he says, <span class="hi2">I will no more follow thee</span>! to the <span class="hi2">Devil,</span> he says, I <span class="hi2">will no longer gratifie thee, as formerly</span>! but unto the most High God, he says, <span class="hi2">Lord,</span> I <span class="hi2">will be for thee, and not for another.</span> Such is the FAITH of a Regenerate man, that when the Lord Jesus Christ Invites him, <span class="hi2">Look unto me, and be Saved</span>! and, <span class="hi2">Come unto me and</span> I <span class="hi2">will give you Rest</span>; with a Conquered Soul he answers, <span class="hi2">Lord,</span> I <span class="hi2">Look, Lord,</span> I <span class="hi2">come, <span class="pb">21</span> Lord, Let me by thy Mediation be Saved, and have Rest for ever</span>! He has been so Awakened, as to see himself perishing in all Spiritual and Eternal
                  Calamities; <span class="hi2">Wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked</span>; and he has been in most uneasy Agonies of Mind, until God hath directed His Thoughts
                  unto the Lord Jesus Christ, as unto that <span class="hi2">Prince and Saviour, who gives Repentance and Remission of Sins.</span> He cries out, <span class="hi2">In the Lord let me have Righteousness and Strength</span>! because he finds himself miserably destitute of both. He brings nothing but <span class="hi2">Sins</span> and <span class="hi2">Plagues</span> to recommend him unto the Lord Jesus Christ; but at the Encouragement of the <span class="hi2">Free Grace</span> which has made the proffers thereof unto him, he Relies upon the Lord Jesus Christ,
                  for <span class="hi2">Wisdom, Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</span> He does with a Distressed Soul behold all the <span class="hi2">Offices</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, whereupon he implores, <span class="hi2">Let me come to have Peace with God by the Atonement of that Priest</span>! and, <span class="hi2">Let me be under the Instruction of that Prophet</span>! and, <span class="hi2">Let me be under the Government of that King</span>! His prejudice against the <span class="hi2">Benefits</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, has been taken away in the, <span class="hi2">Day of Power, when God made him willing</span>! and his Comfortable Expectations from the no less Compassionate than All sufficient <span class="pb">22</span> Jesus, now are, <span class="hi2">To be forgiven all sin<span class="gap1">•</span></span> and, <span class="hi2">To be cleansed from all Unrighteovsness.</span></p>
               <p class="p">In Fine, 'Tis by <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> that a man comes to consent unto the COVENANT of GRACE, in all the parts, and in all
                  the terms of it. When we are <span class="hi2">First-Born,</span> we are under the <span class="hi2">First Covenant,</span> and under the curse which the <span class="hi2">First Adam</span> has according to that Covenant Entail'd upon us. But when we are <span class="hi2">Born again,</span> we come under the Wings of the <span class="hi2">New-Covenant,</span> by Resigning ourselves unto the <span class="hi2">Second Adam,</span> as unto our Head, Our Lord, Our Mediator. I beseech you to mind what I am going to
                  say: <span class="hi2">Set your hearts unto these things, for they are your Life</span>; and if while I am speaking <span class="hi2">these things, your hearts</span> become really <span class="hi2">Moulded</span> thereinto, we shall together praise God forever, that ever he gave us this opportunity!
                  Yea, I shall surely and shortly meet you with joy at the Right Hand of the Lord Jesus
                  Christ.
               </p>
               <p class="p">I say then, we are now advised of a Covenant wherein, <span class="hi2">The Glorious JESUS is entrusted for His people, not only with</span> Life <span class="hi2">to be bestowed upon them at the Last; but also with</span> Grace <span class="hi2">to enable them unto the Doing of all that must be done to prepare them for it.</span> A Covenant wherein, <span class="hi2">The Blessed Jesus will</span> Confer <span class="hi2">all saving mercies upon us, if we are but willing to</span> Receive <span class="hi2">those mercies: and all the Qualification <span class="pb">23</span> that he demands in order to our being</span> Justified, <span class="hi2">and so</span> Sanctify'd <span class="hi2">and</span> Glorified, <span class="hi2">is our Hearty</span> Acceptance <span class="hi2">of all those Blessednesses.</span> A Covenant wherein, <span class="hi2">Our having an Heart, even so much as to</span> Will <span class="hi2">any good thing, must be ascribed unto the Supernatural and Undeserved Assistences of a God Soveraign as well as Gracious.</span> A Covenant wherein, <span class="hi2">All the</span> Called <span class="hi2">of the Lord Jesus, must be willing to Express their</span> Gratitude <span class="hi2">unto Him for Delivering them from Spiritual and Eternal Miseries, by sincere Endeavours
                     to walk before Him in</span> Holiness <span class="hi2">and</span> Righteousness <span class="hi2">all their Days.</span> A Covenant, Lastly, wherein, <span class="hi2">The</span> Imperfection <span class="hi2">of all our Duties, is Compensated by the perfect</span> Obedience <span class="hi2">of the Lord Jesus Christ; and our Inclination to</span> Do as well as we can <span class="hi2">with Gods Help, does an Effect proves</span> its Cause, <span class="hi2">prove our Participation in that Obedience.</span> Well, when Almighty God makes this Demand of us, <span class="hi2">Art thou willing to Converse with me, and have and own me for</span> thy God, <span class="hi2">in the way of such a Coveaant</span>? the Regenerate Soul answers, <span class="hi2">Lord, I am willing</span>! And I add, that when once a man comes to <span class="hi2">Approve</span> this way of Salvation by Jesus Christ, and <span class="hi2">Repose</span> and <span class="hi2">Venture</span> all his Everlasting Interests upon it, there is a work of <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> in the Soul of such a man. <span class="hi2">Consent!</span> O Immortal Soul; <span class="hi2">Consent!</span> before we pass any further: say <span class="hi2">Amen,</span> to this <span class="hi2">Covenant</span>; and <span class="pb">24</span> the God of Heaven will immediately pronounce upon thee, <span class="hi2">This is a dear Son, this is a pleasant Child,</span> I <span class="hi2">will surely have mercy upon him!</span> To set an Edge upon these things let us now think on, what may be,

               <h2 class="head">The Second PROPOSITION.</h2>
               <p class="p">The KINGDOM of God, cannot be Enjoy'd without the Experience of this REGENERATION.
                  Behold, a flaming Sword in the <span class="hi2">Mouth</span> of the Lord Jesus, guarding of <span class="hi2">Paradise</span> from the Intrusions of all that are not <span class="hi2">Born again</span>! Moreover, What are the <span class="hi2">Unregenerate,</span> but the <span class="hi2">Unrighteous</span>? Now of them 'tis said, in 1 Cor. 6.9. <span class="hi2">Know ye not, that the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God?</span> Again, what are the <span class="hi2">Unregenerate,</span> but the <span class="hi2">Unconverted?</span> But of such 'tis said, in Mat. 18.3. <span class="hi2">Verily, I say unto you, except ye be Converted, ye shall not Enter into the Kingdom
                     of Heaven.</span> I freely say to you, if I speak any thing without Book, believe me not, but now you see
                  this <span class="hi2">Word established by the mouth of two or three Witnesses!</span> It then only needs to be Enquired,
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="hi2">What is that</span> KINGDOME OF GOD, <span class="hi2">which without</span> Regeneration, <span class="hi2">cannot be Enjoy'd</span>?
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">25</span>Know therefore, that it means, <span class="hi2">The Blessed state, whereinto God brings his chosen by the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
               <p class="p">A state wherein God Himself is the <span class="hi2">King</span> of His people, and wherein the People of God, will as <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>, have a Dominion over all their Interiour adversaries. The Lord said unto hi<span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="hi2">Israel,</span> in Exod. 19.6. <span class="hi2">Ye shall be unto me a Ki<span class="gap1">•</span>gdome of Priests and an holy Nation.</span> And alluding thereunto, it is said of all the <span class="hi2">Faithful</span> in 1. Pet 2 9 <span class="hi2">Ye are a Royal Priesthood, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar People.</span> Now there are singular priviledges belonging to this <span class="hi2">Peculiar People</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> all of which no man without <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> can be admitted unto. In our <span class="hi2">Birth</span> from si<span class="gap1">••</span>ul Parents, we are <span class="hi2">Born Slaves</span>; Yea, the <span class="hi2">servants of servants.</span> We are <span class="hi2">children</span> indeed; but of what? <span class="hi2">Children of Wrath,</span> and the Heirs of death. But by another <span class="hi2">Birth,</span> from the Spirit of God making New Creatures of us, we are <span class="hi2">Born Kings</span>; there are many <span class="hi2">Crowns</span> that belong unto us. Particularly.
               </p>
               <p class="p">I. Without <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> a man cannot enjoy a GOSPEL-ESTATE in this world. It is true, an Unregenerate man may get into a <span class="hi2">Visible Church-state,</span> which is called, <span class="hi2">The Kingdome of God.</span> There are <span class="hi2">Black Tares</span> in that field, there are a <span class="hi2">Bad <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span></span> in that Net, there are <span class="hi2">Foolish Virgins</span> at that Feast; but still, they are not proper <span class="hi2">Enjoyers</span> of the <span class="pb">28</span> <span class="hi2">Good</span> in the State. There may be Traitors in the Kingdome, and <span class="hi2">Ishmaels</span> and <span class="hi2">Judases</span> in the Families, of the Church; but unto what purpose? It cannot be said of them, <span class="hi2">They have seen the Kingdome of God come with power,</span> all this while. Unregenerate Soul, Hear thy Circumstances, and be Amazed!
               </p>
               <p class="p">First, <span class="hi2">Gospel Mysteries,</span> cannot be Discerned by an Ungenerate Man. He is, <span class="hi2">Born Blind,</span> and so he continues, till the <span class="hi2">New-birth</span> has once Enlightened him. There are <span class="hi2">Thick scales</span> upon the Eyes, which <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> has not opened. The <span class="hi2">Methods</span> and <span class="hi2">Rewards</span> used by God, in Governing of the <span class="hi2">Unseen World,</span> are most of all <span class="hi2">Unseen</span> by the Unregenerate: It is said, in 1 Cor. 2.14. <span class="hi2">The Natural man cannot know them, because they are Spiritually Discerned.</span> Without Regeneration a man cannot come to understand, <span class="hi2">How man is to be Saved,</span> or, <span class="hi2">How God is to be Served,</span> or, <span class="hi2">How things depend upon one another, in the Great Mystery of Godliness.</span> 'Tis with him, as in Luc. 14.34. <span class="hi2">The Eye is Evil, and the Body is full of Darkness!</span> and his Conceptions about the Things of God, are like those which a Beggar in his
                  Hovel, or an Indian his Wigwam, has about the Magnificence of a mighty Kingdom. Lamentable
                  man! <span class="hi2">Sampson</span> with his Eyes extinguished, grinding for the <span class="hi2">Philistines,</span> was <span class="pb">29</span> not in a Condition so deplorable<span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span></p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, <span class="hi2">Gospel Services</span> cannot be attended by an Unregenerate Man. We are told, <span class="hi2">That the Kingdom of God, is Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost</span>; but without <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> there is no Attaining of them. There is a certain Homage which we are to pay unto our Great <span class="hi2">King</span>; but the Unregenerate Man being of, <span class="hi2">The Bruitish among the People,</span> does labour under an utter and a mortal Incapacit<span class="gap1">•</span> to render that, <span class="hi2">Reasonable Service.</span> Thus 'tis said, in <span class="hi2">Rom.</span> 8.8. <span class="hi2">They that are in the Flesh cannot please God.</span> The man is told, and warn'd, and charg'd from time to time about, <span class="hi2">The Thing that Good is</span>; but he can Do nothing! He can yield unto God, no Worship that is Right for the <span class="hi2">Matter</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> the <span class="hi2">Manner,</span> and the <span class="hi2">Motive</span> of it. He cannot Serve God <span class="hi2">Spiritually</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> for he is all <span class="hi2">Flesh</span>; and his very <span class="hi2">Soul</span> within him, is as One of the Ancients has it, after a sort <span class="hi2">Incarnated:</span> he may too truly say, <span class="hi2">The Law is Spiritual, but</span> I <span class="hi2">am carnal, sold under Sin</span>! When he pretends to wait upon God, it is with an Application of his whole Soul:
                  every Sacrifice that he brings has the Ill Omen of being, <span class="hi2">without an Heart</span>; he may say, <span class="hi2">I Lift up my Eyes, my Hands, my Voice!</span> but he cannot say with the Psalmist, <span class="hi2">Lord, I Lift my Soul unto thee</span>; nor, <span class="hi2">Serve the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me</span>! <span class="pb">30</span> Nor can he Serve God <span class="hi2">Sincerely</span>; for he was conceived with what i<span class="gap1">•</span> contrary to, <span class="hi2">Tr<span class="gap1">•</span>th in the Inward Parts</span>; and it is nothing but <span class="hi2">Fear</span> of some Temporal Inconvenience, or <span class="hi2">Pride</span> of being Applauded among men, that makes him do what he does. 'Tis only <span class="hi2">Self,</span> that Clay<span class="gap1">•••</span>ol, <span class="hi2">Self,</span> which puts this <span class="hi2">Pharisee</span> upon Shows of <span class="hi2">Piety</span> or <span class="hi2">Charity</span>; and <span class="hi2">God</span> is not before him. It was said, in <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 4.24. <span class="hi2">They that Worship God must Worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</span> But what a <span class="hi2">vain Worship</span> then, is that of the Unregenerate! Useless Wretch, what is he good for?
               </p>
               <p class="p">Thirdly, <span class="hi2">Gospel Priviledges</span> may not be expected by a man that is Unregenerate. What the Psalmist said about the <span class="hi2">City,</span> we may say about the <span class="hi2">Kingdom,</span> of God, <span class="hi2">Glorious Things are spoken of thee</span>! But until by Regeneration Men are Naturalized, in this <span class="hi2">Kingdom,</span> they cannot lay claim to those <span class="hi2">Glorious Things. 'Tis Regeneration</span> that helps us to that <span class="hi2">Wedding Garment,</span> without which, if we come to the Gospel Table, the Great <span class="hi2">King</span> will say unto us, <span class="hi2">How camest thou hither</span>?
               </p>
               <p class="p">But particularly, The Unregenerate Man can have no <span class="hi2">Union</span> with the Lord Jesus Christ: No, He is yet in the <span class="hi2">First Adam.</span> A man cannot be United unto the <span class="hi2">Heavenly Adam,</span> without the <span class="hi2">Heavenly Image.</span> 'Tis in Regeneration, that we come to be Grafted <span class="pb">31</span> upon the only Living and Lifegiving <span class="hi2">Olive Tree.</span> The Apostle counts it a filthy Absurdity, in 1 <span class="hi2">Cor.</span> 6.15. <span class="hi2">Shall I take the Members of Christ, and make them the Members of an Harlot? God forbid.</span> Even so, can a <span class="hi2">Mind</span> be United unto the Lord Jesus Christ, while it is yet. <span class="hi2">Enmity against God?</span> Can an <span class="hi2">Heart</span> be United unto the Lord Jesus Christ, while it is yet, <span class="hi2">A Cage of Unclean Lusts<span class="g2">▪</span></span> Can the Lord Jesus take a <span class="hi2">Tongue</span> into an Union with Himself, and Leave the <span class="hi2">Poison of Asps</span> Lurking and working under it? Shall the <span class="hi2">Mystical Body</span> of our Lord be like <span class="hi2">Nebuchadnezzars</span> Image, the Head <span class="hi2">Gold,</span> and the Members <span class="hi2">Clay? God forbid?</span></p>
               <p class="p">Again, The Unregenerate Man, can have no <span class="hi2">Title</span> to the Saving <span class="hi2"><span class="gap1">•</span>enefits</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ. I have now Three <span class="hi2">Wo-Trumpets,</span> to Sound in the Ears of such a man; so that it may be very truly said, a <span class="hi2">Dreadful Sound is in his Ears</span>! Let the Sinner, <span class="hi2">first,</span> hear that Account of his wretchedness, in <span class="hi2">Prov.</span> 9.12. <span class="hi2">He shall be Holden with the Cords of his Sins.</span> An Unregenerate Man, is an <span class="hi2">Unjustify'd</span> man. Since it may be said of him, <span class="hi2">Thy Heart is not Right in the sight of God,</span> it may be also said of him<span class="g2">▪</span> <span class="hi2">Thy Iniquities keep thee in a Condition more Bitter than any Gall, bound over to Suffer
                     Eternal Punishments!</span> O Dreadful Condition! If Unregenerate, then <span class="hi2">Unpardoned.</span> The <span class="pb">32</span> Sins of such a man are <span class="hi2">Follow'd</span> by him, and so long they can't be <span class="hi2">Forgiven</span> to him. All the many <span class="hi2">Thousands</span> of Sins wherewith he has Rebell'd against the God that made him, are still fresh and
                  full upon the score against him, as if they had been but this very morning perpetrated;
                  and the Loud Cry of them, <span class="hi2">Heaven, Pay us our Wages! Pay us our Wages! Let the Death of the Sinner, which is
                     our Wages, be pay'd immediately</span>; this Cry is going up to Heaven against him every Day. <span class="hi2">Thy Iniquity is marked before Me, saith the Lord!</span> Let the Sinner take a <span class="hi2">further</span> Account of his Wretchedness, from <span class="hi2">Prov.</span> 15.8. <span class="hi2">The Sacrifice of the Wicked, is an Abomination to the Lord.</span> The Unregenerate man is an <span class="hi2">Unaccepted</span> man. The Delight of God is only in <span class="hi2">Himself,</span> and in what of Himself is in the Creature; but here is One, <span class="hi2">Without God in the World.</span> It is an Established Thing, <span class="hi2">Without Faith it is impossible to please God</span>; but the Unregenerate is also an <span class="hi2">Unbeliever.</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> the poor man do never so many Religio<span class="gap1">•</span>s, <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> Charitable and Serviceable Things, they are but so many <span class="hi2">Splendid Sins,</span> in the Account of God. All the <span class="hi2">Oblations</span> of such a man, are no better than <span class="hi2">Swines Blood</span>; and the Blessed God, says, <span class="hi2">I like them not</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> because they cannot be duly Qualify'd. His <span class="hi2">Good Works,</span> are but so many Cyph<span class="gap1">•</span>es<span class="g2">▪</span> wanting that Figure that should give a value <span class="pb">33</span> to them all: He is one who, <span class="hi2">Turns away his Ear from hearing the Law,</span> and therefore his very <span class="hi2">Prayers are an Abomination.</span> But then Let it be entred as a <span class="hi2">Third</span> Instance of the Sinners wretchedness, what we have, in <span class="hi2">Heb.</span> 12.8. <span class="hi2">Ye are Bastards and not Sons.</span> If without <span class="hi2">Castigation,</span> much more without <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> a man has no pretence unto an <span class="hi2">Adoption</span> by the Lord. The <span class="hi2">Honour</span> and the <span class="hi2">Image</span> of Gods Children must ever go together. 'Tis only the <span class="hi2">New-Born</span> that have, <span class="hi2">The power to be called, the Sons of God</span>: nor may any one else hope for, <span class="hi2">The Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</span> As none but, <span class="hi2">They that are Led by the Spirit are the Sons of God,</span> so, are none but they that are <span class="hi2">Born of that Spirit.</span> Until persons <span class="hi2">come out from among</span> the Unregenerate, the Almighty God says not unto them, <span class="hi2">I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters.</span> No, 'tis another Family, that the Unregenerate belongs unto; what is the <span class="hi2">Name</span> of him? only <span class="hi2">The seed of the Serpent</span>; and, <span class="hi2">A Generation of Vipers,</span> and, <span class="hi2">Ye are of your Father the Devil</span>! That, there is all <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> Style that belongs to Wretched Unregenerates.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Once more, Thirdly, those <span class="hi2">Holy Things,</span> the <span class="hi2">Sealing Ordinances</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, belong not unto an unregenerate man. There is a <span class="hi2">Seal</span> but unto a blank, if we administer <span class="pb">34</span> those <span class="hi2">Seals</span> unto such as have no <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> in them. A man must be visibly <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> before he may lawfully claim the <span class="hi2">Baptism</span> of the Lord, for himself and his house. There is as well <span class="hi2">Purgation</span> of Soul, as <span class="hi2">Remission</span> of Sin, Sealed in that Ordinance: which who has but the <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span>! It was of Old required, <span class="hi2">Repent and be Baptised:</span> It was again required, <span class="hi2">If thou believest with all thine heart, then mayest be Baptised</span>; Now who do's that, but the <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> of the Lord? Until a man be hopefully washed in, <span class="hi2">The Laver of Regeneration,</span> he will but pollute, <span class="hi2">The Laver of Baptism,</span> if he be brought unto it. A <span class="hi2">John,</span> would not Baptise, such as did not <span class="hi2">Confess</span> their sins, and give cause to think that they did <span class="hi2">Forsake,</span> what they did <span class="hi2">Confess.</span> Unto <span class="hi2">Baptism,</span> there is requisite, as we read, in 1. Pet. 3.21. <span class="hi2">The answer of a good Conscience.</span> The most High demands of us, <span class="hi2">Wilt thou be my servant &amp; souldier according to my Covenant for ever</span>? but an unregenerate man do's not with a <span class="hi2">good Conscience</span> make that <span class="hi2">Answer</span> thereunto, <span class="hi2">Lord I will</span>! and therefore the <span class="hi2">Waters</span> of Baptism<span class="g2">▪</span> are but, <span class="hi2">stollen Waters,</span> to such a man. Again, A man may not be received unto the <span class="hi2">Supper</span> of the Lord, until he make a probable, and credible Profession of his being <span class="hi2">Regenerate.</span> In that Ordinance is our Communion with the Lord Jesus Christ, and our Participation
                  in all the good <span class="pb">35</span> effects of his Death, seal'd unto us; but except a man be <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> how can he look for such things as these? It is only in Evang<span class="gap1">•</span> lical <span class="hi2">Churches</span> that there is this Table to be spread; and these are to be, <span class="hi2">Churches of Saints,</span> and, <span class="hi2">Holy Brethren,</span> and such as are, <span class="hi2">Washed, Sanctify'd, Justify'd,</span>; a main design of these <span class="hi2">Churches</span> is to Represent unto the world, who they are, that shall <span class="hi2">Ascend onto the Hill of the Lord, and stand in His Holy Place for ever</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> but such as are not <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> are not of those. <span class="hi2">Dead</span> Souls are not fitt guests, for the <span class="hi2">Supper</span> of our Living Lord; it belongs to none but <span class="hi2">Penitents</span>; others are to be Rebuked; Censured, and <span class="hi2">Bound on Earth,</span> from the liberties of such a Fellowship. A man taking the Sacramental <span class="hi2">Bread</span> and <span class="hi2">Wine,</span> therein says, <span class="hi2">I have chosen the Lord Jesus Christ, thus Exhibited, for my Lord Redeemer</span>; but without <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> a man utters but a great Lye in saying so. It is enjoined on a Communicant, in 1. <span class="hi2">Cor</span> 11.28: <span class="hi2">let the man examine himself.</span> Of what: One thing is, whe<span class="gap1">••</span>e<span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> be not an unregenerate man: or whether <span class="gap1">•</span>e have, <span class="hi2">the good Mind</span> and, <span class="hi2">the pure Heart,</span> and, <span class="hi2">the vertuous Life,</span> after which the Primitive Churches enquired, in their Communicants: lest otherwise
                  he may more fatally than ever the Emperour did, swallow his Poison in the <span class="hi2">Eucharist.</span> Behold O Immortal Souls, what a dismal thing tis, to be unregenerate! But here <span class="pb">36</span> is nor all the <span class="hi2">Lamentation and Mourning and wo,</span> which I am to fill my little <span class="hi2">Uolumn</span> with. We must add.
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="hi2">II.</span> Nor can a man enjoy a GLORIOUS ESTATE in an other world, without <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> We are told in 1. <span class="hi2">Pet.</span> 1 24. <span class="hi2">God hath begotten us again, to a Lively hope; to an Inheritance Reserved in Heaven for us.</span> Why, without being <span class="hi2">Begotten again,</span> we can have no <span class="hi2">Hope</span> o<span class="gap1">•</span> ever coming to that <span class="hi2">Inheritance.</span> The very Pillars of Heaven, and the foundations of the Earth, are not more Immoveble,
                  than this purpose of our God, <span class="hi2">Without Holiness no man shall see the Lord</span>; now tis by <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> that we are partakers of that <span class="hi2">Holiness.</span> There is a <span class="hi2">Kingdome</span> which God has promised; but only they that <span class="hi2">Love</span> Him, are the <span class="hi2">Heirs</span> of that <span class="hi2">Kingdome</span>; now of an unregenerate man it may be said, <span class="hi2">How dwells the Love of God in such a man</span>! Wherefore
               </p>
               <p class="p">First, The unregenerate man, shall be excluded from the <span class="hi2">Glorious Kingdome</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ in the <span class="hi2">Lower World,</span> at the day of judgment. The Day is at the Do<span class="gap1">•</span>r, [<span class="hi2">Lord Hasten it</span>!] When the Papal and the Turkish Power being extinguished, and the Divel also having no further power to Deceive
                  the Nations, is will be Proclaimed, <span class="hi2">The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of <span class="gap1">•</span>is Christ, and He shall Reign <span class="pb">37</span> for ever and ever.</span> THEN comes, <span class="hi2">the Time of the Dead, that they should be Judged</span>; THEN will our Lord assume His <span class="hi2">Davidical Kingdom,</span> and <span class="hi2">Reign before His Ancient People Gloriously:</span> THEN will be that <span class="hi2">Appearing and Kingdome</span> of our Lord, wherein He <span class="hi2">Will Judg the Quick and Dead.</span> Our Lord, speaking of that <span class="hi2">Kingdome,</span> calls it, in <span class="hi2">Mat.</span> 19 28. <span class="hi2">the</span> REGENERATION, <span class="hi2">When the Son of Man, shall Sitt on the Throne of His Glory.</span> Well, and Without <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> a man shall then have no comfortable share in the <span class="hi2">Glory</span> of that Kingdome. Both the <span class="hi2">New-Heaven,</span> when our Lord with His Raised ones, will occupy the Room now possessed by the <span class="hi2">Prince of the Power of the Air,</span> and the <span class="hi2">New-Earth</span> where will be the <span class="hi2">Nations</span> of the saved from the conflagration; in both of these, there will, <span class="hi2">Dwell Righteousness</span>; and surely then there must be <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> in them. None but the <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span> may Sing that Song, in <span class="hi2">Rev.</span> 5.10. <span class="hi2">We shall Reign over the Earth.</span> None but <span class="hi2">Saints of the Most High,</span> shall then have the <span class="hi2">Kingdome</span> given unto them. None but <span class="hi2">Overcomers</span> are then to have <span class="hi2">Power over the Nations.</span> There wil be no <span class="hi2">Lots</span> in the Heavenly <span class="hi2">Canaan</span> for any but the <span class="hi2">Daniels</span> of the Lord. They are only the <span class="hi2">Holy</span> ones, who now <span class="hi2">Rise</span> from a <span class="hi2">Death of sin,</span> that shall have a part in that <span class="hi2">First Resurrection</span>; tis only the <span class="hi2">Upright,</span> who shall then have the <span class="hi2">Dominion.</span> Unless men be <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> the Lord Jesus <span class="pb">83</span> Christ will not at the great Day acknowledg them with a, <span class="hi2">Come ye blessed, Inherit the Kingdome:</span> nor shall they then meet with any thing but, <span class="hi2">Shame and contempt.</span> The <span class="hi2">New Jerusalem</span> will not be <span class="hi2">Defiled</span> with any <span class="hi2">Unregenerate</span>; but they shall be hissed out of that <span class="hi2">Holy City,</span> with a, <span class="hi2">Depart ye cursed into everlasting Fire, with the Devil and his Angels:</span> and all their Wickedness will therewithal be <span class="hi2">shew'd before the whole Congregation.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, The Unregenerate man shall be Banished from the <span class="hi2">Glorious Kingdom</span> of the Lord Jesus, in the <span class="hi2">Upper World,</span> throughout the Days of Eternity. A <span class="hi2">Saul</span> must have <span class="hi2">Another Heart,</span> before he were fit for <span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="hi2">Kingdom</span>; and so must a Sinner, before he can be fit for this <span class="hi2">Kingdom.</span> Between <span class="hi2">Glorification</span> and <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> the Connexion is Inseparable. No <span class="hi2">Unclean</span> man might Enter into the Temple of old; nor shall any <span class="hi2">Unregenerate</span> One Enter into the Heaven oft the Blessed. As the <span class="hi2">Serpent</span> himself shall no more come into the Paradise of God, so the <span class="hi2">Seed</span> of that Serpent shall be Exiled from thence, with what we have in <span class="hi2">Math.</span> 7.22. <span class="hi2">Depart, I know you not, ye workers of Iniquity</span>! We may as well suppose that a piece of Rotten <span class="hi2">Flesh</span> may become a Glittering <span class="hi2">Star,</span> in the Firmament of God, as that there should be one Unregenerate man, in that Retinue
                  of many <span class="hi2">Thousands,</span> which our Lord Jesus <span class="pb">39</span> Christ, as a <span class="hi2">Standard Bearer</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> in the Head of them, will conduct into the Caelestial Regions, when He shall <span class="hi2">Deliver up the Kingdom unto the Father.</span> Yea, it may be said of the <span class="hi2">Unregenerate,</span> not only that he SHALL NOT, but also, that he CANNOT have a part in that <span class="hi2">Kingdom.</span> For, it is, first, impossible, that the <span class="hi2">Exercises</span> of Heaven should be performed by an Unregenerate man. As for the <span class="hi2">Love</span> of God, which is to <span class="hi2">Remain,</span> in Heaven; unless God <span class="hi2">Circumcise our Hearts</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> we cannot <span class="hi2">Love the Lord our God with all our Hearts?</span> As for the <span class="hi2">Praise</span> of God, which for ever Employs the <span class="hi2">Hallelujahs</span> of the Glorify'd; how can the <span class="hi2">Blessing of God,</span> come out of the <span class="hi2">bitter mouth,</span> which is <span class="hi2">full of Deadly Poison?</span> And, secondly, 'tis impossible that the <span class="hi2">Recompences</span> of Heaven, should be Relished by such a man. <span class="hi2">They</span> must be Inlaid into the very <span class="hi2">Frame</span> of our Souls, if ever we have them; yea, <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> is the <span class="hi2">Inchoation</span> of them. Were an <span class="hi2">Unregenerate</span> man, on the Mountain of Transfiguration, he could not say, <span class="hi2">'Tis good for to be here</span>! O fearful Case! Th<span class="gap1">•</span> man that often said of a <span class="hi2">Sabbath</span> here, <span class="hi2">What a Weariness is it?</span> would also be, <span class="hi2">Weary of the Rest which Remains for the People of GOD</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> What Resentments can a <span class="hi2">Dead</span> Carcase have of a <span class="hi2">Robe</span> or <span class="hi2">Crown</span> put upon it? That Heaven would be rather a <span class="hi2">Torment,</span> <span class="pb">40</span> than a <span class="hi2">Content</span> unto an Unrenewed Soul. What can a <span class="hi2">Contemplation</span> of God, signify to one that says unto the Almighty, <span class="hi2">Depart?</span> What can a <span class="hi2">Conformity</span> to Christ, be with one, who <span class="hi2">Loaths</span> the <span class="hi2">Hidden Manna?</span> THIS, This 'tis to be Unregenerate.
               </p>
               <p class="p">AND now there is a most Importunate EXHORTATION &amp; EXCITATION to be given unto those
                  that are yet perishing in their <span class="hi2">Unregeneracy.</span> 'Tis thus much; Miserable Souls, make sure of <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> before it be too late: <span class="hi2">Give all Diligence to make your Vocation and Election sure.</span> Or, take it in the words of the Prophet, <span class="hi2">Ezek.</span> 18.31. <span class="hi2">Cast away from you all your Transgressions, and make you a New Heart, and a New Spirit; for why will you Dy?</span> Sinners, you never were Addressed, upon a Matter of more Importance for you: We must be in Earnest
                  with you; and there are two things to be <span class="hi2">Ask'd</span> of you<span class="g2">▪</span> yea, to be <span class="hi2">Charg'd</span> on you, in the Name of the God that made you.
               </p>
               <p class="p">I. In the first place then, Be very sensible of your own <span class="hi2">Inability</span> to accomplish your own <span class="hi2">Regeneration.</span> Ly humbly under the Awe of that Assertion, in Phil. 2.13. <span class="hi2">It is God, who Works in you, both to Will and to Do, of His own Good Pleasure.</span> It is God, who not only gives us the <span class="hi2">Power</span> of Turning <span class="pb">41</span> to Himself, but every <span class="hi2">Act</span> of Turning also, must be of His production. Without such an <span class="hi2">Humiliation</span> in your Souls, the <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> of your Souls, is utterly to be despaired. How apt will men be to put off all cares about their own <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> if they imagine that they can always have within their own reach, <span class="hi2">The Things that accompany Salvation,</span> or that they have a <span class="hi2">Key</span> in their own Hands with which they can Unlock Heaven at their own Arbitrary Leisure?
                  How unlikely will the Soveraign God also be, to bestow <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> upon those who do not own that <span class="hi2">Soveraignty,</span> or do not feel that we are, <span class="hi2">Saved by Grace, thro' Faith; and this not of our selves, 'tis the Gift of God</span>? Indeed, the Natural and Essential <span class="hi2">Freedome of our Will,</span> remains unto us; it wills <span class="hi2">freely,</span> wherever it <span class="hi2">Wills</span> at all: but alas, 'tis no better than, <span class="hi2">Free among the Dead:</span> only <span class="hi2">Dead Works</span> are grateful to the Will of the Unregenerate: his <span class="hi2">Will,</span> as well as the rest of his whole Soul, is corrupted in him. Tis very true, that God <span class="hi2">Commands</span> us to Return unto Himself; yea, there is both Infinite <span class="hi2">Justice</span> and Infinite <span class="hi2">Wisdom,</span> in his giving of that <span class="hi2">Command</span>: there is <span class="hi2">Justice</span> in it, because we Owe unto God our Maker all manner of Obedience, and tho' we in the
                  Apostasy of our First Father, justly Imputed unto us, have sinned away our Ability
                  to yield that Obedience, yet <span class="pb">42</span> <span class="hi2">Gods Right</span> is not impair'd by <span class="hi2">our Crime</span>; there is <span class="hi2">Wisdom</span> in it, because God Requires nothing of us, but what our Natural <span class="gap1">•</span>aculties were Originally suited unto; because <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> have new such an occasion to be convinced of our own Impotency, as may fitly engage us to acknowledge the Help of God; and
                  because the Calls which God gives us to Do what we <span class="hi2">Can't,</span> are made proper <span class="hi2">Vehicles</span> for his Divine Assistances to be therein convey'd unto them whose <span class="hi2">Names are in the Book of Life.</span> But still, 'tis as true that we are of our selves utterly <span class="hi2">Unable</span> to Return unto our God: and that He will not Look in mercy upon us, till <span class="hi2">He</span> make us to be <span class="hi2">Sensible</span> of our being thus unable. In truth, while a man is Unregenerate, he can do nothing
                  in <span class="hi2">Faith,</span> and so nothing but <span class="hi2">Sin,</span> in all that he does; it may be said of him, <span class="hi2">That every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually</span>; it may be said of him, <span class="hi2">He is Reprobate unto every Good Work</span>: to miscarry in every thing, is tho' <span class="hi2">Voluntary</span> yet <span class="hi2">Necessary,</span> with him; and it becomes us to make our bitter moans accordingly. When God commands
                  us to become <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> Own that you are justly Damned, if you do it not; and yet sadly mourn before the Lord, <span class="hi2">O I am Dead, in Trespasses and Sins</span>; Complain, <span class="hi2">Lord, my obstinate will cannot be <span class="gap1">••</span>ee to a Spiritual Good, until Thou make <span class="pb">43</span> it free</span>! Declare, <span class="hi2">Lord, I cannot come unto the Son of God, except the Father draw me</span>! Look upon <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> as an efficacious, &amp; supernatural operation of God, wherein he does not only lay <span class="hi2">Moral Perswasions</span> before men, but also infuse a new <span class="hi2">Frame</span> into the Will, and Spiritually Heal, Quicken, and Reform, the formerly Rebellious <span class="hi2">Wills,</span> of that Select number which he did from all eternity set apart for the <span class="hi2">Sheep</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ- Say, that you are far from a capacity of <span class="hi2">Regenerating</span> yourselves, yea, that you cannot so far Dispose and Prepare yourselves for, your own <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> that God should be obliged by your well<span class="gap1">•</span>improving of his Common-Grace, to work it in you; Say, <span class="hi2">Tis not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</span> Tis an Article Asserted by the Church of <span class="hi2">England,</span> (the Tenth of the famous Thirty Nine) <span class="hi2">The Condition of man, is such after the Fall, that he cannot turn, nor prepare himself
                     by his own natural strength, to Faith, and calling upon God; wherefore we have no
                     power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God preventing us, that we may have a good Will, and working with
                     us, wh<span class="gap1">••</span> we have that good Will.</span> And it is an Article that calls for the hearty Assent and Consent of all that by <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> come into the Sheep fold of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">44</span>II. And yet, in the Second place, O do what you <span class="hi2">can,</span> and as much as Ever you <span class="hi2">can,</span> about your own <span class="hi2">Regeneration.</span> Though you have no promise, that if you do what you <span class="hi2">can,</span> you shall certainly speed in what you do; yet you will be the more inexcusable, if
                  you have not so done, in the Day of Gods pleading with you; and besides, in so doing
                  there is an, <span class="hi2">It may be,</span> there is an, <span class="hi2">Who can tell</span>! tis not unlikely, that the most High may so touch your souls, that ere you are aware,
                  you shall be, <span class="hi2">a willing People.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Particularly;</p>
               <p class="p">First, Can you not avoid the <span class="hi2">Society</span> of those, by whom your own <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> may be discouraged! O then avoid it. What should hinder you that you should not be
                  able to say, as in Psal. 26.3. <span class="hi2">I have not sat with vain person<span class="gap1">•</span></span>! There are ungodly ones that would prejudice your hearts against the power of Godliness, and that would entangle you in the snares of sin and hell: concerning those let me vehemently cry unto you in words like those of <span class="hi2">Moses, Depart I pray you, from these wicked ones, Lest you perish with them.</span> O that you may be deter'd from the <span class="hi2">Fascinations</span> of evil company, by that admonition of wisdome, in Prov. 13.20. <span class="hi2">A<span class="gap1">•</span>co<span class="gap1">•</span>panion of fools shall be destroyed.</span> If you see a Person profane, vitious, extravagant, I say, <span class="hi2">My Son if that sinner entice thee <span class="pb">45</span> consent thou not</span>; shun him, fly him, he may be the cut-throat of thy Soul. Tell him, you cannot walk
                  with him; except hee'll take, <span class="hi2">The way that is called holy.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, Can you not present some kind of <span class="hi2">Supplication</span> before the Lord, for your own <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span>? O then present it. There was a man, to whom, altho' it had been said, <span class="hi2">Thy Heart is not Right,</span> yet there was that Advice given, in <span class="hi2">Acts</span> 8.22. <span class="hi2">Pray to God</span>! If the Life of your Bodies lay at stake, would you not be in Earnest for Deliverance? Behold, O Dying Sinner, Thy SOUL, Thy Soul is in the very <span class="hi2">Belly</span> of <span class="hi2">Hell</span>; and why then dost thou not like the Psalmist, <span class="hi2">Call upon the Name of the Lord, and say, I bese<span class="gap1">•</span>ch thee to Deliver my Soul</span>! Fall down upon thy Knees before the God of Heaven, and pray, and say, as in <span class="hi2">Jer.</span> 31.18. <span class="hi2">O Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</span> Beg of Him, <span class="hi2">Lord, fulfil in me the good pleasure of thy Goodness, and the work of Faith with power!</span> Plead with Him, <span class="hi2">Lord, thou hast said, that there are some to whom thou wilt give a New Heart and a
                     New Spirit; and if thou wilt, thou canst make such a Wretch as I am, the partaker
                     of such a Blessedness</span>! An <span class="hi2">Old Nature,</span> is like an <span class="hi2">Old Devil</span>; it goes not out, without much <span class="hi2">Prayer</span> to God. Cavil not, <span class="hi2">My Prayers are an Abomination:</span> it will be a greater <span class="hi2">Abomination</span> <span class="pb">46</span> to Neglect them, than to Perform them; at least, you may see whether He that regards the Cries of the Needy <span class="hi2">Ravens</span> and <span class="hi2">Lions,</span> may not have His <span class="hi2">Ear</span> open unto thine; and if it may be said of thee, <span class="hi2">Behold he Prays</span>! 'tis hopeful, thou art upon such a <span class="hi2">Turn,</span> that it may be further said, <span class="hi2">This poor man Cryed, and the Lord Heard and Saved!</span></p>
               <p class="p">Thirdly, Can you not Attend the Ministry of that <span class="hi2">Word</span> whereby <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> is Effected? O then Attend it. It is said, in 1 <span class="hi2">Pet.</span> 1.23. We are, <span class="hi2">Born again by the Word of God, which Liveth and Abideth for ever.</span> Wherefore, place your selves as much as you can, under the Dispensations of that New
                  Creating <span class="hi2">Word!</span> Were you daily conversing with the <span class="hi2">Word</span> of God, you would therein <span class="gap1">•</span>ie at the <span class="hi2">Pool,</span> in the <span class="hi2">House of Mercy</span>: who knows, but God may there meet you, with a Cure of all your Maladies? Can you not Read a <span class="hi2">Bible,</span> as well as a <span class="hi2">Gazet,</span> or a <span class="hi2">Romance</span>? Can you not as easily go to a <span class="hi2">Sermon,</span> as a <span class="hi2">Tavern</span>? O be continually waiting, upon Wisdoms <span class="hi2">Lively Oracles,</span> that so you may, <span class="hi2">Hear and Live</span>! Said the Apostle, in 1 Cor. 4.15. <span class="hi2">In Christ Jesus, I have Begotten you, thro' the Gospel:</span> so then, if the <span class="hi2">Gospel</span> were always in your Eyes or Ears, 'tis Likely that you might be, <span class="hi2">Begotten of Christ Jesus.</span> The Breath of <span class="hi2">Satan</span> was that which did corrupt you, and the <span class="pb">47</span> Breath of <span class="hi2">Jesus</span> may now Amend you. 'Tis said, <span class="hi2">Where the word of a King is, there is Power:</span> If then, you seriously set your selves before and under the <span class="hi2">Word</span> of the Eternal <span class="hi2">King,</span> it may have such a <span class="hi2">power</span> on you, as to bring you home unto God. When two or three <span class="hi2">Scriptures</span> were Quoted unto <span class="hi2">Peters</span> Hearers, they were soon; <span class="hi2">Pierc'd in Heart</span>; and by the use of the <span class="hi2">Scriptures</span> may you come to be as well, <span class="hi2">Chang'd in Heart.</span> When <span class="hi2">Austin</span> was call'd upon, <span class="hi2">Take up and Read,</span> then the close of the Thirteenth Chapter to the <span class="hi2">Romans</span> whereto he was directed, proved the means of his Conversion. I say then, <span class="hi2">Take up and Read.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Fourthly, You can CONSIDER; and Oh that you would! It is said, in Ezek. 18.28. <span class="hi2">Because he Considers, and he Turns, he shall surely Live.</span> It seems that <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> is the frequent Introduction of <span class="hi2">Regeneration:</span> A Prodigal will be likely to <span class="hi2">Come unto a Right Mind,</span> if once he begin to <span class="hi2">Bethink himself.</span> We have been told of a wicked young man, who being obliged by his Dying Father, to
                  spend a quarter of an Hour every Day, only in <span class="hi2">Considering,</span> even on any thing, what he pleased; at length he began to <span class="hi2">Consider,</span> what might be the Cause of his Fathers giving him such a Charge: <span class="hi2">This</span> fill'd him with <span class="hi2">serious <span class="pb">48</span> Thoughts,</span> and his <span class="hi2">Considerations</span> were so blest, as to issue in his being brought home to God. O that you would make
                  this Experiment! Can you not ever now and then, <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> from <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> Nones, <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> and Enchantments of the World, and <span class="hi2">Consider</span> with your selves, <span class="hi2">What is the present, and what is like to be the future condition of my Soul</span>? 'Tis no Extraordinary Difficulty, that is now Imposed upon you; I may urge, <span class="hi2">My Neighbour, If I had asked you to do some great thing for the Conversion and Salvation
                     of your Soul; would you not have done it? A SOUL, certainly 'tis well worth all that
                     can be done for it. How much more when you are only ask'd, that you would a little CONSIDER the things of your Everlasting Peace?</span> I say then, CONSIDER; and hope, none of you will Reply, That an Eternal <span class="hi2">Kingdom,</span> is not worth our taking so much pains, as that of a little <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> for it.
               </p>
               <p class="p">But there are seven or eight matters o<span class="gap1">•</span> most Awful CONSIDERATION, that have now to lay before you: and because of a singular <span class="hi2">Efficacy</span> not only in the <span class="hi2">Assertions,</span> but in the very <span class="hi2">Expressions</span> of the Scripture, I shall Arrest your Thoughts, with so many Sentences taken out from
                  the Word of God; thus it is with a, <span class="hi2">Thus saith the Lord,</span> That I require you to <span class="hi2">Consider.</span> And,
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">49</span>I. The first <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> proper for you is that, in 2 Pet. 1.4. <span class="hi2">There are given to us, exceeding great and precious Promises, that by these you might
                     be made partakers of the Divine Nature.</span> CONSIDER, That <span class="hi2">all the great and precious Promises of God, will become your Portion, when once you are Born Again.</span> As the Lord shew'd unto our Father <span class="hi2">Abraham,</span> the Land of <span class="hi2">Promise,</span> and said, <span class="hi2">Lift up now thine Eyes, and Look; for all the Land that thou seest, unto thee, will
                     I give it</span>; even so, Let us by <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> once become the <span class="hi2">Children of Abraham,</span> and then, whatever good Things are contained in all the Promises of God, He will say, <span class="hi2">All that thou seest, and infinitely more than thou canst Think, will I give unto thee</span>: Whatever <span class="hi2">Promise</span> we can find in any part of the Bible, we may with an Appropriating Joy of Soul, say, Like one of the Ancients, thereupon, <span class="hi2">This word is mine! Here's a Promise that I am owner of!</span> Let us become Regenerate, and from that Moment, the Almighty GOD, will by His <span class="hi2">Promise,</span> give no Less than Himself unto us: we shall have an Interest in that <span class="hi2">Promise,</span> Jer. 31.33. <span class="hi2">I will be their God.</span> The <span class="hi2">Essence</span> of God will then be for us, and according to the <span class="hi2">Promise,</span> Our <span class="hi2">Maker will be our Husband.</span> The Great God now promises, <span class="hi2">My power shall be thine to supply <span class="pb">50</span> thee,</span> and, <span class="hi2">My Wisdom shall be thine to Direct thee,</span> and, <span class="hi2">My Goodness thine to Relieve thee.</span> The <span class="hi2">Subsistence</span> of God will then also be by <span class="hi2">Promise</span> Engaged for us: God the <span class="hi2">Father</span> now promises, I <span class="hi2">will be thy Father</span>: God the <span class="hi2">Son</span> says, <span class="hi2">I will be thy Saviour</span>: and God the <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> says, <span class="hi2">I will be thy Strengthener.</span> Behold, enough to satisfie the vast Cravings of the most Enlarged Soul! And yet, there
                  is more for us; Let us become Regenerate, and there are Innumerable <span class="hi2">sure Mercies,</span> which the <span class="hi2">Promise</span> will make <span class="hi2">sure</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> us, as the consequent hereupon. We shall have an Interest in that <span class="hi2">Promise,</span> Psal. 84.11. <span class="hi2">The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield, the Lord will give grace and glory; No good thing
                     will he withold from them that walk uprightly:</span> Yea, and Help to <span class="hi2">Walk uprightly</span> too. We now have that <span class="hi2">Godliness,</span> which has, <span class="hi2">The promise both of the Life which now is, and of that which is to come.</span> We may now Lay hold of that Promise, <span class="hi2">They that seek the Lord shall not want any good Thing</span>; that Promise, <span class="hi2">All things shall work together for Good unto them that Love God</span>; and that Promise, <span class="hi2">Thou shalt Guide me with thy Counsel, and afterwards Receive me to Glory.</span> All <span class="hi2">Temporal</span> Blessings for which we may have occasion, will now be made over to us; but especiall<span class="gap1">•</span> all <span class="hi2">Spiritual</span> Ones; <span class="hi2">The chief Things of <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> Ancient Mountains, and the precious <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> Everlasting Hills.</span> Obdurate <span class="pb">51</span> Sinner, Thy Heart is more Impenetrable than the Nether Milstone, if this Consideration do not move thee, melt thee, break thee! <span class="hi2">Abraham</span> could readily forego a <span class="hi2">Son,</span> for a <span class="hi2">Promise</span>; and wilt not thou forego a <span class="hi2">Sin</span> for all the <span class="hi2">Promises</span>? What a profane <span class="hi2">Esau</span> art thou, to <span class="hi2">Despise</span> all of this Invaluable Blessedness? But
               </p>
               <p class="p">II. A second <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> useful for you, may be that in Isa. 1.2. <span class="hi2">Hear, O Heavens, and Give ear, O Earth; for the Lord hath spoken; I have Nourished and brought up Children, and they have Rebelled against me.</span> CONSIDER, That <span class="hi2">until you are Born again, all the more than Fatherly Mercies of God are both Ill bestowed,
                     and Ill Requited.</span> The God of Heaven has dealt like a <span class="hi2">Father</span> with you, all your Days hitherunto: and you speak but Reasonably, when you say unto
                  Him, <span class="hi2">Our Father</span>! It is <span class="hi2">He</span> that has produced you from <span class="hi2">Nothing,</span> into <span class="hi2">Being,</span> and it is <span class="hi2">He</span> that has preserved you in <span class="hi2">Being</span> from Threatning and Invading <span class="hi2">Mischief.</span> They are Gods <span class="hi2">Creatures</span> which Comfort you, and Cherish you; 'tis His <span class="hi2">Air</span> you breath, 'tis His <span class="hi2">Ground</span> you tread, they are His <span class="hi2">Cloaths</span> that Cover you. It is <span class="hi2">He</span> that every Hour defends you from a Million Deaths; and supplies you with multitudes of <span class="hi2">Conveniencies</span> both for Inward and Outward Man. And what is the Language of <span class="pb">52</span> all this Kindness? 'Tis that in Rom. 2.4. <span class="hi2">The Goodness of God, Leads thee to Repentance.</span> By <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> we should now come to behave ourselves like <span class="hi2">Children</span> unto a <span class="hi2">Father</span> so favourable, so compassionate! The voice of all the Divine Benignity unto us, is
                  that, <span class="hi2">O live unto that God, from whom, and on whom it is that thou livest at all</span>! The <span class="hi2">Israelites</span> could say to such a Benefactor as <span class="hi2">Gideon,</span> in Judg. 8.22. <span class="hi2">Rule thou o<span class="gap1">•</span>er us, both thou and thy son, for thou hast delivered us.</span> How much more ought wee to become Regenerate, by resigning ourselves unto the Government
                  of that God, who has been our <span class="hi2">Deliverer</span> all this while, and who has <span class="hi2">Redeemed us from all Adversity</span>? Be sure, till you are Born again, all the Bounties of God are utterly lost upon
                  you; Gods <span class="hi2">Corn</span> and Gods <span class="hi2">Wine</span> is given unto <span class="hi2">Baal</span>; and you are continually Fighting against God with Weapons of His own. As <span class="hi2">David</span> said of an <span class="hi2">Unthankful Nabal, In vain have</span> I <span class="hi2">kept all that this Fellow hath</span>; so may the Lord say of an <span class="hi2">Unholy Sinner; All my Mercies to this Wretch, are meerly thrown away: He makes me
                     no suitable Returns for all my Benefits.</span> Never was any <span class="hi2">Ingratitude</span> so monstrous, as that of <span class="hi2">Unregeneracy</span>! To continue in <span class="hi2">REBELLION</span> against God, amongst His most wicked and cursed Enemies, after all that He has done <span class="pb">53</span> for you! tis the Worst Instance, of, <span class="hi2">Requiting evil for Good,</span> that ever was afforded. After all the Goodness and Mercy wherewith God has <span class="hi2">follow'd</span> you all your days<span class="g2">▪</span> His demand is but <span class="hi2">that,</span> in Deut. 10.12. <span class="hi2">And now what doth the Lord thy God Require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God,
                     to walk in all his ways, and to love Him?</span> And O thou sinful Unregenerate! What a Vile Disingenuity is it for thee to be, as thou art continually A<span class="gap1">•</span> fronting and Reproaching of God thy Saviour? It seems that he has, but as the Proverb speaks, <span class="hi2">Brought up the Whelps of Wolves,</span> in all the Cost that He has laid out upon thee. And Oh! How will all thy past enjoyments
                  come in, as confounding <span class="hi2">Witnesses</span> against thee, in the day wherein, thou shalt find thy self to be <span class="hi2">Accountable.</span> Particularly, Many a <span class="hi2">Life,</span> has been spent &amp; Lost in the Service of thy <span class="hi2">Life</span>; &amp; all the Creatures will with Loud Clamours plead against thee, saying, <span class="hi2">Lord, our Lives went, that so this Wretch might have lived unto Thy Glory! We were
                     all abused inasmuch as he did it not!</span></p>
               <p class="p">O Think on the kindnesses of the Ever-Gracious God: And let thy Heart relent, as did
                  the heart of <span class="hi2">Saul,</span> when he saw <span class="hi2">David</span> sparing of him; say, <span class="hi2">Lord I cannot go on to wrong Thee any more</span>!
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">54</span>III. A Third <span class="hi2">Consideration,</span> That may be needful for you, is that<span class="g2">▪</span> in Psal 90.3. <span class="hi2">Thou turnest man to destruction, and saiest, Return ye Children of Men.</span> CONSIDER, That the <span class="hi2">Judgments of God, upon yourselves and others, are vehement calls upon you to be Born again.</span> Have you not felt many <span class="hi2">Afflictions</span> upon yourselves<span class="g2">▪</span> Why, <span class="hi2">Hear the Rod</span>; there is a <span class="hi2">Cry</span> in that which makes <span class="hi2">you</span> to <span class="hi2">Cry:</span> it saies thus much, <span class="hi2">O that you were Born again.</span> It is said, The <span class="hi2">Lord scourgeth every Son whom He Receiveth</span>; but He <span class="hi2">Scourges</span> you that so you may become willing to be <span class="hi2">Sons.</span> The Cry of <span class="hi2">Sickness</span> is, <span class="hi2">O that by Regeneration you may be Born twice, before you dy once thro Mortality: your outward Man is decaying, see then that your Inward may be renewed</span>! The Cry of <span class="hi2">Reproach</span> is, <span class="hi2">You that have a Bad Name, Look after a New Name; you that have your Names Trampled
                     in the Mire of the Earth, see that your Names be Written in Heaven; and whatever else
                     you may be called, make sure that you be called, The Children of God</span>! The Cry of <span class="hi2">Bondage</span> is, <span class="hi2">Look after the Redemption of your souls; Ask the Son of God that you may be free indeed;
                     Get out of the Bond of Iniquity</span>! The Cry of <span class="hi2">Poverty</span> is, <span class="hi2">Lay up a Treasure in Heaven. Do you want food! Be concerned about the Meat which Endures
                     to everlasting Life. Do you want Clothes? Be concerned about the Fine Linnen, which
                     is the Righteousness of the Saints. Do you want a dwelling! <span class="pb">55</span> Be sollicitous for a Room in the Fathers House, where there are many Mansions</span>! And if you have any <span class="hi2">Friends</span> taken from you, That is the Cry of it, <span class="hi2">Close now with the Lord Jesus Christ, who is better than Ten Sons, Let God become your God, who is an Alsufficient one</span>! It is the Direction of Heaven in Job 34.31.32. <span class="hi2">Surely, it is meet to be said unto God, I have born chastisiment, I will not offend
                     any more. That which I see not, Teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do
                     no more.</span> A Theef on a Cross, Blaspheming the Lord, was indeed a very rueful sight; but every
                  afflicted person remaining <span class="hi2">Unregenerate,</span> is indeed such a sight. Again, have you not seen many <span class="hi2">Miseries</span> upon Others also? Why, there is a Lesson given us by all those calamities, like that
                  which the Historian tells us, was upon the Statue of <span class="hi2">Senacherib, Let the spectator become a Godly person</span>; that is, One Born again. When you see others made the Monuments of Gods Anger, it cries to <span class="hi2">you</span>; and there is thus much in the <span class="hi2">Cry, O that by Regeneration, you would secure yourselves, from the like indignation</span>! It is the Use that Our Lord has directed us to make of all Desolations, in Luc.
                  13.3, 5. I <span class="hi2">tell you Nay, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</span> And its by so <span class="hi2">Repenting,</span> that you are to become <span class="hi2">Regenerate</span>!
               </p>
               <p class="p">IV. A Fou<span class="gap1">•</span>th <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> to Encourage <span class="pb">56</span> you, may be that in Luc. 15.10 <span class="hi2">I say unto you, there is Joy in the presence of the Angels of God, over one sinner
                     that Repenteth.</span> CONSIDER, That, <span class="hi2">by your being born again, you will fill not Earth only, but Heaven too, with Joy.</span> All the Good men on <span class="hi2">Earth</span> to whom the Notice of your <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> shall arrive, will be Ravished at the News of it. Perhaps there are some ungodly <span class="hi2">Fools,</span> that may flout and scoff, at your turning unto God, and say, <span class="hi2">VVhat? you are turning a Saint; are you?</span> But <span class="hi2">they</span> not being <span class="hi2">Saints,</span> are much worse than <span class="hi2">Bruits</span>; and in the mean time for those that are truly wise, and that are best able to Judge
                  what Wisdom is, <span class="hi2">Of them you shall be had in Honour.</span> The <span class="hi2">Saints</span> are, <span class="hi2">The Excellent in the Earth,</span> and, <span class="hi2">More Excellent than their Neighbours</span>; Their Good word is of Ten thousand times more account, than all the commendation of them that are, <span class="hi2">The men of this world</span>: and whenever you become <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> all those your <span class="hi2">Excellent bretheren,</span> will immediately Glorify God in you and for you: as when a <span class="hi2">Sa<span class="gap1">••</span></span> was becoming a <span class="hi2">Paul,</span> tis reported, in Act. 9.21. <span class="hi2">All <span class="gap1">••</span>at heard it, were amazed</span>: so upon your Change among the people of God, <span class="hi2">All that see it, will be affected</span>! However, you will set all Heaven on rejoicing, when-ever you shall be brought home
                  to God.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Would you this day give up yourselves to God in Christ sincerely and entirely, the
                  Tidings <span class="pb">57</span> would immediately be carried into Heaven it self, and the very <span class="hi2">Angels</span> of the Highest, would in the Highest, <span class="hi2">Rejoyce with Joy Unspeakable and full of Glory</span>! As at the <span class="hi2">First Creation</span> of the World, so at a <span class="hi2">New Creation</span> in thy Soul, <span class="hi2">The Morning-stars would sing together, and the Sons of God shout for joy</span>: O Deny not such a Satisfaction to those Charitable Spirits, by thy <span class="hi2">Holding fast</span> of thy Unregeneracy, and thy <span class="hi2">Refusing to Return</span>! As poor and mean a Wretch as thou art, yet upon thy Regeneration, there would be
                  unspeakable Triumphs among the <span class="hi2">Angels</span> of God; the Gladsome Rumour would be spread thro' the Ethereal Regions, <span class="hi2">Behold, there is another Sinner Converted from the Errour of his way; and there is
                     another Soul to be Saved from Death! Behold, there is come in another Heir of Salvation,
                     for us, to Minister unto! Behold, there is another Branch of Humane Race, come in,
                     to fill up the vacant Room, that the Apostate Legions have left among us! O Let us
                     now praise God for such as are coming to praise God with us for ever.</span> And if any of your <span class="hi2">Dead Relations</span> may be now Lodg'd among those Glorious Angels, I know not why <span class="hi2">They</span> also may not be admitted unto a Participation in that Caelestial <span class="hi2">Gladness</span>: tho' our <span class="hi2">Prayers</span> to Them would be a Detestable Idolatry, yet their <span class="hi2">Praises</span> for us may be without any Harm imagined? Why may not<span class="g2">▪</span> <span class="hi2">They</span> Rejoyce and say, <span class="hi2">Blessed be God, that the Prayers <span class="pb">58</span> which we made for the Conversion of our Friends below, are now Answered; Blessed be
                     God, that they are like to come hither after us!</span> But it is very certain, That there is a most Ineffable Joy in the Heart of the Infinite
                  God Himself, whenever you become Regenerate, and begin to <span class="hi2">Choose the Things that please Him.</span> You will be the Joy of the whole <span class="hi2">Trinity</span>; God the Holy Ghost will Rejoyce and say, <span class="hi2">Behold, another Temple for me to have the possession of</span>! God the Son, will Rejoyce and say, <span class="hi2">Behold, another Member, helping towards the Fulness of my Mystical Body!</span> And the Eternal <span class="hi2">Father</span> will now Rejoyce over the Returning Prodigal, as in Luc. 15.32. See, <span class="hi2">One that was Dead, and is alive again; One that was Lost, and is found!</span> It was a surprizing passage that fell from the dying Lips of one in our Neighbourhood, who after
                  fifty years of Impiety and Impenitence, becoming <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> a few weeks before he Dy'd, after he had Lain for a while speechless and senseless in his Death-pangs, he to the amazement of the Spectators, Recovered so far, as to utter these Rapturous EXPRESSIONS, <span class="hi2">O my Friends, Heaven Rings all over at this; They wonder at This; A Great and an Old
                     Sinner coming to Heaven: O Glorifie Free Grace for evermore.</span> And so he gave up the Ghost. Why, this is what I have said; Become Regenerate, and <span class="hi2">all <span class="pb">59</span> Heaven will Ring with it.</span> Hard-hearted sinner! How canst thou Resist Perswasives, thus full of Argument?
               </p>
               <p class="p">V. A fifth <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> to Alarum you, may be that in Luc. 10.42. <span class="hi2">One Thing is Needful.</span> CONSIDER, That <span class="hi2">without being Born again, there is nothing that will, nothing that can, secure the
                     Wellfare of your Immortal Souls. Regeneration</span> is indeed a thing, which leaves no Room for <span class="hi2">Deliberation,</span> inasmuch as it is most absolutely <span class="hi2">Necessary</span> for us all. Never say, <span class="hi2">Shall I! Shall I!</span> be Born again; for, <span class="hi2">Necessity is laid upon you, and Wo unto you, if you have it not</span>! What provision have you made for your poor <span class="hi2">Souls,</span> ye miserable Unregenerates? After all the Riches, and all the Honours, and all the Learning
                  which you can here attain unto, how miserably still are your poor <span class="hi2">Souls</span> all this while provided for? O that you would <span class="hi2">once</span> at least Think to purpose upon that Word of our Lord Jesus, which a Great King was
                  advised <span class="hi2">every day</span> to Think upon; in Mat. 16.26. <span class="hi2">What is a man profited if be gain the whole World, and Loose his own Soul?</span> But it may be that you have conceived some <span class="hi2">Hopes</span> of your Everlasting Blessedness, upon some other feeble Accounts; and yet these also, without <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> will be found but so many <span class="hi2">Cobwebs,</span> before the Fiery <span class="hi2">Besom of Destruction,</span> at the last. <span class="pb">60</span> As now, 'tis not enough to say, <span class="hi2">I have many Spiritual Priviledges, which may stand my Soul in stead.</span> What though you have been partakers of the Sacraments? The <span class="hi2">Israelites</span> were so, and yet it is said, <span class="hi2">God was not well-pleased with them.</span> What tho' you are Descended of <span class="hi2">Parents</span> that were the Favourites of Heaven? The Jews bragg'd, <span class="hi2">We have Abraham for our Father</span>! but our Lord could Reply upon them, <span class="hi2">You are of your Father the Devil.</span> In a word, whatever External <span class="hi2">Prerogative</span> thou hast, in the Church of God, thou mayst be a woful Citizen of <span class="hi2">Capernaum</span> at the last.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Again, Tis not enough to say, <span class="hi2">My Gifts and Parts are considerable; the Furniture of my Mind is too rich to be <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> of Heaven.</span> Drowning Soul! All the<span class="gap1">•</span>e things may be but as a Bag of Gold about thee, to sink thee so much the deeper in <span class="hi2">Perdition.</span> I pray, what was the <span class="hi2">Death,</span> what was the <span class="hi2">Last End</span> that <span class="hi2">Balaam</span> had? May not one, <span class="hi2">Speak with the Tongues of Men, and of Angels,</span> and yet be destitute of a Saving <span class="hi2">Charity</span>! Alas, a man, may be no less than an Able Minister of the Gospel<span class="g2">▪</span> and yet fare no better than One of <span class="hi2">Noahs</span> Carpenters after all.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Further, 'Tis not enough to say, <span class="hi2">I am Civil, Honest, Harmless; none of my Neighbours are the worse for me.</span> Was there not a <span class="hi2">Pharisee,</span> who could boast, <span class="hi2">I am not as <span class="pb">61</span> other men, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers</span>: and yet he was not <span class="hi2">Justify'd</span>? Was there not a Young Man, who could boast, <span class="hi2">All the Commandments of the second Table, I have kept from my Youth:</span> and yet <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>, <span class="hi2">Lacked One Thing</span>? What Signify'd it unto <span class="hi2">Paul,</span> that he was, <span class="hi2">Touching the Righteousness which is in the Law blameless</span>?
               </p>
               <p class="p">Moreover, 'Tis not enough to say, <span class="hi2">My Religious Exercises are not a few</span>; I <span class="hi2">Pray, I Hear, I Fast, and use much Devotion</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> The Jews have a saying, If only two men in the World were to be Saved, the One of
                  them would be a <span class="hi2">Scrib<span class="gap1">•</span>e,</span> the other a <span class="hi2">Pharisee.</span> 'Twas <span class="hi2">They,</span> who could pretend, <span class="hi2">I fast twice a Week, and give Tithes of all that I possess.</span>. And yet, what said <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> who is <span class="hi2">Truth</span> it self! <span class="hi2">Except your Righteous<span class="gap1">••••</span> shall exceed that of the Scribes and I <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Furthermore, 'tis not enough to say, I <span class="hi2">have had many good affections moving in me</span>; I <span class="hi2">have had my heart mightily <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> in the Ordinances of God; and many a <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> have I <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> fall upon the matters of Eternity</span> Many an <span class="hi2">Ahab</span> has been Terrified by the Judgments, or Threatning, of God. Many an <span class="hi2">H<span class="gap1">•</span>r<span class="gap1">•</span>l,</span> <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> himself gladded under an Evangelical Ministry. Many a <span class="hi2">Balaam</span> has had <span class="hi2">slothful desires,</span> after the Felicity of the Righteous. But what of all that?
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">62</span>Once more, 'Tis not enough to say, <span class="hi2">Good men Judge nothing but good of me,</span> I <span class="hi2">have a room in the heart of such as are eminent for Godliness; yea,</span> I <span class="hi2">am of their party, and have suffered with them.</span> There was a time when <span class="hi2">David</span> thought as well of <span class="hi2">Achitophel.</span> And among all the Disciples, who suspected <span class="hi2">Judas</span>? A <span class="hi2">Simon Magus</span> may for a while be regarded by the most Eminent Apostles of Our Lord. An <span class="hi2">Ananias,</span> and a <span class="hi2">Sapphira,</span> may get into the Church. And impious <span class="hi2">Alexanders,</span> have been famous Confessors, for the Cause of God.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Add hereunto; 'Tis not enough to say, <span class="hi2">God hath smiled many ways upon me; He hath answered my Prayers, prevented my Fears,
                     and shown himself concerned for me.</span> What if all your <span class="hi2">Preservations</span> be but <span class="hi2">Reservations</span>! Was there not an <span class="hi2">Ham</span> spared, when Millions of people perished about him? What if your petitions are heard
                  in the <span class="hi2">Court</span> of Heaven, but in the course of Common Providence! Did not a <span class="hi2">Pharaoh</span> receive what he asked?
               </p>
               <p class="p">All these things will be but so many, <span class="hi2">Refuges of Lies,</span> if you go to shelter yourselves without <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> in them. God will no more spare you for these things, than <span class="hi2">Samuel</span> did <span class="hi2">Agag,</span> for the Ornaments that were upon him.
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">63</span>VI. A Sixth <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> to awaken you, shall be that in Psal. 7.11· <span class="hi2">The mighty God is angry with the wicked every day.</span> CONSIDER, That <span class="hi2">The wrath and curse of the Great God abideth on you, till you are Born again.</span> We read in Zech. 5.4. Concerning, <span class="hi2">A flying ROLL of Curses, Twenty Cubits Long, and Ten Broad.</span> But indeed such a ROLL were too little to hold all the <span class="hi2">Curses</span> which an Unregenerate man lies open unto. Either become Regenerate, or else look for, all <span class="hi2">The Plagues written in Gods Book,</span> ye souls desolate and forsaken! That which was a Mistake in <span class="hi2">Job</span> of old, may be too truly, but never too sadly, concluded by all that are yet in their
                  Sins, <span class="hi2">God counts me for his enemy</span>! And accordingly in all that He speaks to you, there are the <span class="hi2">Woes,</span> in all that he does to you, there are the <span class="hi2">Wounds,</span> of an <span class="hi2">Enemy.</span> It is said in Prov. 3.33. <span class="hi2">The Curse of the Lord, is in the house of the Wicked.</span> There are perhaps these and those fine enjoyments in thy <span class="hi2">House,</span> but the <span class="hi2">Curse</span> of God like a <span class="hi2">Leprosy,</span> cleaves unto them all. Thy very <span class="hi2">Blessings</span> themselves are <span class="hi2">Cursed,</span> and thy <span class="hi2">Table</span> becomes a <span class="hi2">Snare.</span> The <span class="hi2">Curse</span> of God is the Sauce in every Dish, the Spice in every Cup, with which thou meddlest;
                  and that <span class="hi2">Curse</span> is the Coverlid which thou still sleepest under. The <span class="hi2">Curse</span> accompanies thee, like thy very shadow; every thing do's but help to poison thee,
                  to undoe thee, to destroy thee: thou <span class="pb">64</span> hast the <span class="hi2">wrath</span> of God, with all thy <span class="hi2">Quails.</span> The most <span class="gap1">•</span>reful, Di<span class="gap1">•</span>eful <span class="hi2">Plagues</span> of God, are therewithal sent upon thy forlo<span class="gap1">•</span> Soul. That Soul, is given over, as <span class="hi2">a Captive to the Devils</span> and a <span class="hi2"><span class="gap1">•</span>re<span class="gap1">•</span> to the Terrible ones.</span> Never is, <span class="hi2">The Light of Gods Countenance,</span> uplifted upon that w<span class="gap1">•</span>ful Soul; Tis a Soul altogether left in Ignorance, Confu<span class="gap1">•</span>ion, and Frozen-Midnights: a Soul abandoned by Grace, <span class="hi2">and Pining away in its Iniquities.</span> Soul to be Lamented! How canst thou be quiett in this Unregeneracy? Why, thou art in a <span class="hi2">Prison</span>; which Prison is also on a Light Fire over thine head! If thou art contented that
                  God should Abhor thee, Ban thee, Damn thee; what is thy heart but Adamant! What are
                  thy Heart-Strings but Sinews of Iron?
               </p>
               <p class="p">VII, A Seventh <span class="hi2">Consideration,</span> to be as a <span class="hi2">Go<span class="gap1">••</span></span> unto you, must be that in Ezek. 18.31, 32. <span class="hi2">Why will you Dy? Turn yourselves, and Live ye.</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>, <span class="hi2">That if you are not Born again, you are to Dy for evermore.</span> You have no <span class="gap1">•••</span>ng to live in this world; but I must plainly <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> you, that if you are not <span class="hi2">New-Born</span> before you <span class="hi2">Dy,</span> it had been <span class="hi2">good</span> for you, that you never had been <span class="hi2">Born</span> at all. If you go <span class="hi2">Unregenerate</span> out of this World, there will be <span class="hi2">No Remedy nor es<span class="gap1">••</span>ping,</span> but you must be <span class="hi2">Miserable</span> in another; you must unavoidably <span class="hi2">Go down</span>! even, <span class="hi2">Go down</span>! where, <span class="hi2">The Fire <span class="pb">65</span> shall never be quenched.</span> If you consult the <span class="hi2">Old-Testament,</span> there you are told in, Psal. 9.17. <span class="hi2">The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</span> If you consult the <span class="hi2">New-Testament,</span> there you are told, in Math. 25.46. <span class="hi2">The wicked shall go away into everlasting Punishment.</span> So then, if your Departing Souls a little while hence, are found without the marks of <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> upon them, the <span class="gap1">•</span>iends of Darkness will presently snat<span class="gap1">•</span>h them, seiz them, and hold those Naked Sou<span class="gap1">•</span> in Chains of Darkness, until the dreadful <span class="hi2">Day</span> of God. At the Arrival of which Notable and Amazing <span class="hi2">Day,</span> when the Son of God shall cause the Mountains to quake at the Sound of His Descending
                  Chariots, and the Hills to melt at the presence of His Majesty, and your Souls again
                  to animate these Contaminated Bodies, you must with fiery Thunders be sentenced unto, <span class="hi2">The Vengeance of Eternal Fire.</span> When <span class="hi2">Corah</span> and his company went down into the Pit, all the people, tis said, fled <span class="hi2">At the cry of them, saying, lest the earth swallow us up also</span>! Were the Hideous and Horrible <span class="hi2">Pit</span> of Hell set open before your eyes, you might see Millions of <span class="hi2">Unregenerates</span> there tortured by the rebukes, with which, as with Flashes of Hot Lightning, the Eternal
                  Spirit of God, is for ever smiting of them: there they ly, they vex, they roar, <span class="hi2">I am tormented in this flame:</span> and will not you now fly at this formidable cry, <span class="pb">66</span> saying, <span class="hi2">Lest Hell swallow me up also, in my unregeneracy</span>! Take that warning, O thou Soul in Peril; even that warning in Hebr. 10.32. <span class="hi2">Tis a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God.</span> And know, that without Regeneration, there is no Avoiding of those terrible <span class="hi2">Hands.</span> But, Vain man, wilt thou make light of those Omnipotent <span class="hi2">Hands</span>; the <span class="hi2">Hands</span> that break the stoutest Rocks to pieces, and make the very Pillars of Heaven to Tremble!
                  If thou hast not the Heart of the <span class="hi2">Leviathan,</span> the Monster that is, made <span class="hi2">without Fear,</span> surely thou canst not but be afraid of those Iron <span class="hi2">Hands</span>! Methinks, thou shouldest with an aking heart, hear the almighty God asking of thee, as in Evek. 22.14. <span class="hi2">Can thine heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the day that</span> I <span class="hi2">shall deal with thee?</span> Methinks, when thou be, beholdest the Thousands of Thousands that are Lingring in
                  the Anguishes of the Vault below, thou shouldest cry out as <span class="hi2">Moses,</span> when he behe'd the Careases falling in the Wilderness, in Psal. 90, 11. <span class="hi2">Who knows the Power <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> thine Anger</span>! And one would think, thou shouldest now be willing to be <span class="hi2">Regenerate,</span> being <span class="hi2">Warned</span> thus to <span class="hi2">Flee from the Wrath to come:</span> Even from a <span class="hi2">Wrath,</span> so <span class="hi2">to come,</span> that there will be still, <span class="hi2">more to come,</span> after tis already <span class="hi2">come,</span> and, <span class="hi2">more to come,</span> after it has been inflicted for more than as many Millions of Ages, as the Sky hath <span class="hi2">Stars,</span> or the Shoar <span class="pb">67</span> hath <span class="hi2">Sands,</span> or as the Ocean has <span class="hi2">Drops</span> of VVater in it.
               </p>
               <p class="p">VIII. And now there is one <span class="hi2">Consideration</span> more to quicken you; 'tis that in 2 Cor. 6.2. <span class="hi2">Behold, Now is the Agreeable Time! Behold, Now is the Day of Salvation</span>! CONSIDER, That NOW, NOW <span class="hi2">is your Time to be Born again.</span> Let me lay my Hand upon you, as the Angel upon <span class="hi2">Lot,</span> of old, that I may hasten and hurry you out from the <span class="hi2">Sodom,</span> of your <span class="hi2">Unregeneracy.</span> You are to be spur'd as <span class="hi2">Paul</span> was, <span class="hi2">Arise, why Tarriest thou</span>? You are to be Rowz'd like <span class="hi2">David, Save thy Self to night, for To morrow thou mayst be SLAIN.</span> Regeneration is the <span class="hi2">Kings</span> Business; and I may say thereof, <span class="hi2">It Requires Hast</span>! You have <span class="hi2">Now</span> a Time to be <span class="hi2">Born again</span>; but O Think, what a Time it is.
               </p>
               <p class="p">You have a <span class="hi2">Time,</span> and it is a <span class="hi2">Sure</span> Time. After all your Iniquities, and all your Back. slidings, it is not yet after
                  all, <span class="hi2">Too Late,</span> for you to become Regenerate. Behold, <span class="hi2">After so Long a Time, To Day if you will Hear the voice of God!</span> You are not onely still informed, <span class="hi2">It is Good for you to Draw near unto God,</span> but also the GOLDEN <span class="hi2">Scepter</span> is held out; you may <span class="hi2">Draw Near</span>! Altho' you have wasted many and many a year, in the <span class="hi2">Tents of Wickedness,</span> there is a Proclamation issued forth from the Lord, <span class="hi2">Yet Return unto me, and I will not cause my <span class="pb">68</span> Anger to fall upon you.</span> Hear this, ye Inveterate Unregenerates, and Let your Hearts Relent; <span class="hi2">The King of Heaven is a Merciful King.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Again, You have a <span class="hi2">Time,</span> and it is a <span class="hi2">Fit</span> Time. I may say to you, <span class="hi2">Arise, the Master calleth thee</span>; and then I am sure, 'tis very unfit, that you should refuse or defer to come in
                  at His <span class="hi2">Call</span>! Shall that Lord of Lords, whom all the Angels in Heaven attend upon, wait the Leisure
                  of a Despicable, a Refractory, a sinful <span class="hi2">Worm</span>! In your own Distress, you cry, O <span class="hi2">Lord Hear, Defer not</span>! Why then do you <span class="hi2">Defer,</span> when you <span class="hi2">Hear</span> of your Duty? I am to tell you, <span class="hi2">Old Age,</span> and <span class="hi2">Sickness,</span> are no <span class="hi2">Convenient Season,</span> for a Regeneration to be put off unto; tho' of <span class="hi2">That</span> you Dream, when you procrastinate until, <span class="hi2">A more convenient Season.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Yet again, You have a <span class="hi2">Time,</span> and it is <span class="hi2">Short</span> Time. Talk you of, <span class="hi2">To morrow?</span> But Wisdom says, <span class="hi2">Boast not of To morrow, for thou knowest not, what a Day may bring forth.</span> If you become not Regenerate in <span class="hi2">This Life,</span> you will never be so at all; but what is <span class="hi2">This Life</span>? 'Tis a <span class="hi2">Vapour</span>; aye, and a <span class="hi2">Vapour</span> is enough to carry it away. The <span class="hi2">Salvation work</span> now pressed upon you, is that whereof it may be, and has been said, <span class="hi2">O Do it with thy Might, for there is none of this work to be done in the Grave, whither
                     thou art Going. Going</span> did we say? <span class="pb">69</span> Yea, <span class="hi2">Running,</span> yea, <span class="hi2">Flying,</span> every minute. ETERNITY, Eternity is just going to fasten its Iron Teeth upon you; it won't, it can't be long, before all the Opportunities of <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> will be at an end.
               </p>
               <p class="p">And yet again; You have a <span class="hi2">Time,</span> but it is an <span class="hi2">Only</span> Time. God has not Entrusted you, with so much as one <span class="hi2">Moment</span>; if you do not now this <span class="hi2">Moment</span> become Regenerate, it is possible that you may not have another; it is less probable that you
                  will in another. Stay but a little more, Delay a little more, Dally a little more,
                  cry, <span class="hi2">A little more Slumber</span>! and you'll be gone where, <span class="hi2">O Lord, They cannot Hope for thy Truth</span>! But if once you are gone down, into the Floods of ardent Sulphur, then, ye <span class="hi2">Foolish</span> Ones, 'twill avail nothing to cry, <span class="hi2">Lord, Lord, Open yet the Door of Regeneration for us</span>! To cry, <span class="hi2">Lord, Lord, One Sermon more</span>! To cry, <span class="hi2">Lord, Lord, One Sabbath more</span>! To beg with Tears of Blood, <span class="hi2">Lord, One Season of Grace more</span>! will be of no Avail at all.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Come then, Bring this matter to an Issue; Do not any longer keep <span class="hi2">Wounding</span> of your selves, among the Monuments of the <span class="hi2">Dead.</span> 'Tis thus that the matter lies: Thou hast been horribly depraved by that <span class="hi2">Original Sin,</span> which is derived unto thee from thy First Father; but thy Ti<span class="gap1">••</span> in this <span class="pb">70</span> World is allow'd thee, that thou mayst obtain a Deliverance from that Image of the
                  Devil, by such an <span class="hi2">Union,</span> as will be attended with and productive of a <span class="hi2">Likeness,</span> to the Lord Jesus Christ. If when thy State of <span class="hi2">probation</span> here shall come unto its end, thou art found utterly Uncured of those <span class="hi2">Disorders</span> which thou wast Born withal, and utterly Destitute of a <span class="hi2">Principle</span> which may Dispose thee to <span class="hi2">The Life of God</span>; those Characters of <span class="hi2">Hell</span> upon thy Soul, will become Eternally Indelible. And it is Naturally impossible, that
                  these Everlasting Impressions of <span class="hi2">Sin</span> upon thy Soul, should be unaccompany'd with Intollerable <span class="hi2">Griefs,</span> and <span class="hi2">Fears,</span> and <span class="hi2">Horrors</span>; and Infinite Regretts must become after a sort <span class="hi2">Essential</span> to that lamentable Soul. But, if thy Soul might now have a <span class="hi2">New Frame,</span> a <span class="hi2">Frame</span> Gracious and Heavenly given thereunto, thou wilt shortly see that an Eternal Glory, is <span class="hi2">The self same thing for which Almighty God is working of thee.</span> Sav then, Are you <span class="hi2">willing</span> to be New-Born, or No? If you are now but made <span class="hi2">willing,</span> I hope, that the God who has thus far <span class="hi2">perswaded</span> you, will yet more powerfully and effectually <span class="hi2">perswade</span> you to be more than <span class="hi2">Almost Regenerate:</span> And O the <span class="hi2">Crown of Rejoycing,</span> that we shall then be to each other, <span class="hi2">In the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ <span class="pb">71</span> at His Coming</span>! Well then, make a <span class="hi2">Trial.</span> Reader, I shall set before thee an <span class="hi2">Instrument,</span> whereto if thou canst heartily, sincerely, resolvedly, Subscribe, thou hast felt a saving work of REGENERATION upon thy Soul. Perhaps thou hast been like the man that had a <span class="hi2">Withered Hand</span>; yet it being said unto thee, <span class="hi2">Stretch out thy Hand</span>! Now <span class="hi2">Try,</span> Whether that <span class="hi2">Withered Hand</span> is not so quickned from above, that it can with a most cordial Approbation, set it
                  self unto these Acknowledgments.

               <p class="p">O Eternal God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit!</p>

               </div>
            </div>
            <p class="p">BEhold, the Gracious and Glorious <span class="hi2">Invitation</span> of the Gospel here set before us: There are various and many <span class="hi2">Questions,</span> about which the minds of men are most sollicitously agitated; but there is no <span class="hi2">Question</span> of more Importance to be considered by them, than that, <span class="hi2">What shall</span> I <span class="hi2">do to be Saved</span>? In Answer to that Inquiry, there is, <span class="hi2">The One Thing Needful,</span> recommended unto us, in 1 Joh. 3.23. <span class="hi2">This is Gods Commandment, that we should Believe <span class="gap1">•</span>n the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.</span> Now to Encourage our Obedience <span class="pb">74</span> unto that <span class="hi2">Commandment</span> of God, we have here a most compassionate <span class="hi2">Invitation</span> of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself; wherein, by, <span class="hi2">Coming to Him,</span> He means nothing more nor less than, <span class="hi2">Believing on his Name.</span> The <span class="hi2">Feast of Tabernacles</span> held in <span class="hi2">September,</span> with an Anniversary Observation among the ancient Jews, Typically Represented the
               Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, probably at that very time of the Year,
               first came to <span class="hi2">Tabernacle in Flesh</span> among us. Our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ, the <span class="hi2">Antitype</span> of that Feast, we now find present at it; and inasmuch as the Day after the <span class="hi2">Seventh,</span> darkly pointing at our Christian Sabbath, was the <span class="hi2">Last</span> and <span class="hi2">Great</span> Day of those Eight, wherein they Celebrated that <span class="hi2">Festivity,</span> our Lord then made a most useful Sermon to a Thronged Auditory. Our Text informs us, <span class="hi2">First,</span> What He <span class="hi2">Did.</span> He <span class="hi2">Stood</span>; that was that He might be <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> He <span class="hi2">Cry'd</span>; that was that He might be <span class="hi2">Heard.</span> And <span class="hi2">then,</span> what He <span class="hi2">Said.</span> That was, <span class="hi2">If any man Thirst, Let Him come to me, and Drink.</span> It was an usual Rite, among the Jews at that Solemnity, to fetch Water from <span class="hi2">Siloam,</span> and pour it out before the Lord, using the words of the Prophet, in Isa. 12.3. <span class="hi2">With Joy shall ye Draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</span> Perhaps these Words of our Lord may be on Occasion <span class="pb">75</span> thereof, and in Allusion thereto; and it may be as if our Lord had said, <span class="hi2">Would you know where the true Wells of Salvation are? 'Tis in me, that they are to
                  be met withal: you must come to me for them.</span> The Blessings which our Lord Jesus Christ has to bestow upon us, are here compared
               unto <span class="hi2">Water</span>: and in his Inviting us thereunto, he seems to have some Eye unto the Form of Speaking, used by the Prophet of old, in <span class="hi2">Isa.</span> 55.1. <span class="hi2">Ho every one that Thirsteth, come ye unto the Waters.</span> But there is a most weighty <span class="hi2">Case</span> which hence arises to be considered; and that is,
            </p>
            <p class="p">¶ After what manner ought we to entertain the Invitations which the Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel gives us to come unto Him?</p>
            <p class="p">I would now pray my Hearers, to <span class="hi2">Set their Hearts,</span> unto the Things which I am going to speak; they are not <span class="hi2">Vain,</span> or Light and Small Things; your <span class="hi2">Lives,</span> yea, the <span class="hi2">Lives</span> of your Never-Dying Souls, are as deeply concerned in these things, as in any that
               you were Ever Treated with.
            </p>
            <p class="p">I. There is a <span class="hi2">Thirsty,</span> that is, a Distrest Condition of Soul, whereinto the Children of Men are brought,
               before they will come <span class="pb">76</span> unto the Lord Jesus Christ. We shall never Comply with the Invitations of the <span class="hi2">Gospel</span>; until our Hearts have by an Heartbreaking work of the Law upon them, first been prepared for it: now that work of the <span class="hi2">Law</span> do's raise a Mighty, and a Scalding <span class="hi2">Thirst,</span> in the Souls of them that feel it. When Our Lord was Dying for us, He Cry'd out, I <span class="hi2">Thirst</span>! and that must be our Cry, when we are Coming to Our Lord for the Good Effects of
               His Death. Saies Our Lord, <span class="hi2">If any man Thirst, Let him Come unto Me,</span> not because any Praeparatory <span class="hi2">Thirst,</span> may entitle us unto the use of a Saviour; but b<span class="gap1">•</span>cause without such a <span class="hi2">Thirst,</span> it is Ordinarily and Naturally impossible, that we should care for Our Saviour. All of us <span class="hi2">may</span> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; but we never <span class="hi2">shall,</span> yea, we never <span class="hi2">can,</span> come, till we have <span class="hi2">Thirsty</span> Souls within us. The <span class="hi2">Waters of Life,</span> will not be welcome to us, till we are like <span class="hi2">Sampson</span> or <span class="hi2">Hagar,</span> even Dying in <span class="hi2">Thirsty</span> Anguishes. As the best <span class="hi2">Honey,</span> so the best <span class="hi2">Water,</span> is Loathed by the <span class="hi2">full Soul.</span> Until we are <span class="hi2">Dry</span> by the parchings of Guilt and Grief within us, we shall be <span class="hi2">Deaf</span> to all the proposals of the Lord Jesus Christ. While men have not their Hearts Broken,
               Amazed, and Abased, by <span class="hi2">Convictions,</span> from the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God becoming a <span class="hi2">Spirit of Bondage</span> unto <span class="pb">77</span> them, our Lord says, as in <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 5.44. <span class="hi2">How can you Believe?</span> When our Lord Invites us to <span class="hi2">Come</span> unto Him, He supposes that the Wrath of God has given a dreadful Inflammation unto our Souls; that we have seen the Eternal God Angry with us, and the Everlasting <span class="hi2">Fire</span> of His Indignation in the Fiery Vault below ready to fly up and break out upon us;
               that our Souls have been as it were set on a Light <span class="hi2">Fire,</span> with hideous Apprehensions of the Sins which Ly upon us, and of the Wants and Woes
               which we are exposed unto. Except men are thus <span class="hi2">Awakened,</span> they will for ever sleight all overtures about coming to the Lord Jesus Christ; they will say, <span class="hi2">There is no Beauty in him, for which he should be desired</span>! Until we are thus disturbed in that <span class="hi2">Rest</span> which we had in our corrupt estate under the first <span class="hi2">Adam,</span> we shall never take one good step towards the Second. Well then,
            </p>
            <p class="p">'Tis requisite, <span class="hi2">First,</span> that we become sensible of our <span class="hi2">Emptiness,</span> as to our <span class="hi2">Happiness.</span> We are to have an Exquisite and a Trou<span class="gap1">•</span>blesome sense of this, that we are <span class="hi2">Ungodly and without Strength</span>; that we are, <span class="hi2">Dead in trespasses and sins</span>; that we are, <span class="hi2">Wretched and Poor, and Miserable, and Blind, and Naked.</span> As he cryed out, in Rom. 7.17, <span class="hi2">In me there dwells no Good thing.</span> So are we to complain, <span class="hi2">In me there is no Light</span>! <span class="pb">78</span> and, <span class="hi2">In me there is no Life</span>! and, <span class="hi2">There is nothing in me but an<span class="gap1">•</span> Hell upon Earth</span>! The Veins of our Souls<span class="g2">▪</span> are to Suck and Pull and Prick within us, thro' the perceived Absence of all <span class="hi2">Spiritual Good</span>; they are pungent and painful resentments, of our destitute circumstances, wherewith
               we should say, as in Psal. 119.81. <span class="hi2">Lord, my Soul fainteth for thy Salvation.</span></p>
            <p class="p">'Tis requisite, <span class="hi2">Next,</span> that we become Impatient of our <span class="hi2">Misery</span> by our <span class="hi2">Emptiness.</span> We are to count that our being without the <span class="hi2">Knowledge,</span> and without the <span class="hi2">Image,</span> and without the <span class="hi2">Favour</span> of God, <span class="hi2">is An intolerable thing.</span> As the people could not bear it, when there happened unto them, that mischief, in
               Exod. 17.3. <span class="hi2">The People thirsted for water.</span> So, when we think on the Calamities of our Souls, we should be able to say, <span class="hi2">Lord, I find my self not Able to Bear these Calamities.</span> We are to be <span class="hi2">Filled</span> with Bitter and Grievous Anxieties, when we think how <span class="hi2">Empty</span> we are, of all manner of Good; and we are with <span class="hi2">pierced Hearts,</span> to make that Outcry in Act. 2.37. <span class="hi2">What shall we do?</span></p>
            <p class="p">But then, <span class="hi2">Thirdly,</span> 'Tis requisite that we become Desirous of a <span class="hi2">Remedy</span> for our <span class="hi2">Misery.</span> And since 'tis the Lord Jesus Christ alone, who says unto us, <span class="hi2">In me is thy He<span class="gap1">•</span>p,</span> 'tis after our Lord Jesus Christ, that ou<span class="gap1">•</span> Souls are to cry, with Raging Agonies. <span class="pb">79</span> The Christ-ward Inclinations of our Souls are to be those in Psal. 42.12. <span class="hi2">As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks<span class="g2">▪</span> so panteth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul thirsteth for God, for the Living God.</span> We must be willing to Attend any Thing, to Fore go any Thing, to <span class="hi2">Deny</span> our selves of any thing, which in our Closure with the Lord Jesus Christ is called
               for. What the <span class="hi2">Martyr</span> in the Flames cry'd out, <span class="hi2">None but Christ, None but Christ! That</span> must the <span class="hi2">Enflamed</span> Soul of the <span class="hi2">Sinner</span> cry, tho' all the Pleasures, and all the Riches, and all the Honours of this World
               should be set before him; <span class="hi2">A Christ! A Christ! for an Undone Soul; or else I am Irrecoverably Undone!</span> Never did the Drowning <span class="hi2">An<span class="gap1">•</span>ediluvians</span> more wish for, <span class="hi2">An Ark</span>! Never did a pursued Man-Slayer more wi<span class="gap1">•</span>h for, <span class="hi2">A Refuge City</span>; Never did a poisoned Israelite more wish for, A <span class="hi2">Brazen Serpent</span>; than we are to wish for the <span class="hi2">Sure Mercies</span> of our Lord Jesus Christ. As <span class="hi2">David</span> Longed, in 2 Sam. 23.15. <span class="hi2">Oh that one would give me to Drink of the Water of the Well of Bethlehem!</span> So must we <span class="hi2">Long</span> for all Union and a Fellowship, with that Messias, who was Born at <span class="hi2">Bethlehem</span>; and say, <span class="hi2">O that I had a Christ, for the Satisfaction of a needy Soul.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Until we have some such <span class="hi2">Preparations</span> wrought in our Hearts, we shall certainly remain, <span class="hi2">Shut up in Unbelief</span>; and our Lord <span class="pb">80</span> Jesus Christ will say of us, <span class="hi2">as</span> in <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 5.40. <span class="hi2">Ye will not come unto me, that ye may have Life!</span></p>
            <p class="p">II. In Coming to our Lord Jesus Christ, we must seek and ask for the <span class="hi2">Whole</span> of that <span class="hi2">Salvation,</span> which He has to bestow upon us. It is no sinful <span class="hi2">Selfishness</span> for us, to propound our own <span class="hi2">Salvation,</span> in our Coming unto the Lord Jesus Christ; nor should we be discouraged about the <span class="hi2">Sincerity</span> of our Coming, because we therein acted for our own <span class="hi2">Salvation.</span> The <span class="hi2">Honour</span> and <span class="hi2">Glory</span> of God is enwrap'd so in our <span class="hi2">Salvation,</span> that we shall do amiss if we go to Separate them: I may say, <span class="hi2">What God has thus Joyned, Let no man put asunder!</span> Yea, a man should not forbear Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, altho' he can see nothing,
               but <span class="hi2">Self,</span> stirring him thereunto; Let him come, tho' it be at first upon <span class="hi2">Meaner Ends; that</span> will be the way for him to obtain an Impression of <span class="hi2">Nobler Ends</span> upon him, when he shall come again. However, what is to be, <span class="hi2">The End of our Faith</span>? 'tis to be, <span class="hi2">The Salvation of the Soul.</span> Why then, Let us be sure therein to propound unto our selves, the Enjoyment of ALL that <span class="hi2">Salvation.</span> As it was of old said, <span class="hi2">Is Christ Divided</span>? so we must make no <span class="hi2">Division</span> of that <span class="hi2">Salvation,</span> for which the Lord Jesus Christ is to be Sued unto. Even the <span class="hi2">Murderers</span> of our Lord, were averse unto <span class="pb">81</span> <span class="hi2">Dividing</span> of his <span class="hi2">Garments</span>; and <span class="hi2">Believers</span> on our Lord are as averse unto the <span class="hi2">Dividing</span> of His <span class="hi2">Mercies,</span> Well then, Let us ponder with our selves, what a <span class="hi2">Priest,</span> what a <span class="hi2">Prophet,</span> what a <span class="hi2">King,</span> our Lord-Redeemer is, and let us beseech Him, to Be such an One, and to <span class="hi2">Do</span> all that is to be done by such an One for our Souls.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Particularly, <span class="hi2">Atonement,</span> is one of those things which we are to come unto the Lord Jesus for. We are to come
               unto Him, as He is represented in Psal. 110.4. <span class="hi2">Thou art a Priest for ever!</span> He demands of <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> <span class="hi2">Art thou willing that I should be a Priest for thy Soul</span>! and we must heartily consent unto his being so; therewithal, saying like the Psalmist, in Psal. 119. 122. <span class="hi2">O be surety for thy servant for good.</span> We must come unto Him, as unto, <span class="hi2">The Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world</span>: Come unto Him, as unto <span class="hi2">Him, That Loves us, and washes us from our sins in His own Blood</span>; Come unto Him, as unto that Jesus who having made <span class="hi2">Satisfaction</span> for us on the Cross, here below, goes up, and goes on, to make <span class="hi2">Intercession</span> for us, at the Right Hand of God<span class="g2">▪</span> above. We must ask to enjoy such a JESUS in him! yea, and at the same time, we should
               be willing to pay the Dues of the <span class="hi2">High Priest</span> unto him.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Again, <span class="hi2">Instruction</span> is another of those things <span class="pb">82</span> which we are to come unto the Lord Jesus for. We are to come unto Him, as He is exhibited in Acts 3.22. <span class="hi2">A Prophet shall the Lord Raise up unto you.</span> He enquires of us, <span class="hi2">Art thou willing that I should be the Prophet of thy Soul</span>! and we must sincerely consent unto His being that; saying with the Psalmist, in Psal. 25.4. <span class="hi2">Shew me thy Ways, O Lord; Teach me thy Paths.</span> We must come unto Him, for that <span class="hi2">Eye salve</span> whereof He hath said, <span class="hi2">I counsel thee to buy it of me</span>! Come unto Him, as of old that <span class="gap1">•</span>ind Son of <span class="hi2">Sorrow,</span> crying, <span class="hi2">Lord! that I may recieve my sight!</span> Come unto Him a<span class="gap1">•</span> a Scholar unto a Tutor, that He may show us, <span class="hi2">The Path of Life.</span> So are we to Resign ourselves unto the conduct of Our Lord, that by his unerring <span class="hi2">Scripture,</span> and <span class="hi2">Spirit,</span> He may lead us <span class="hi2">in the Paths of Righteousness.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Once more, Tis for <span class="hi2">Government,</span> and <span class="hi2">Protection,</span> that our Lord Jesus Christ must be come unto. We are to come unto him, as he is described <span class="hi2">Psal.</span> 2.6. <span class="hi2">The King upon the Holy hill of Zion.</span> He puts that on us, <span class="hi2">Art thou willing that I should be a King unto thee?</span> and we should immediately submit unto him, as the <span class="hi2">King,</span> the <span class="hi2">Lord,</span> the <span class="hi2">Law-giver,</span> that is to <span class="hi2">save</span> us; there withal spreading <span class="hi2">That,</span> as the wish of our Souls before Him, in Psal. 119.5. <span class="hi2">O that <span class="pb">83</span> my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes!</span> We must come unto him, that He would <span class="hi2">Bless us, by Turning us every one from our Iniquities</span>; Come unto Him, that he would <span class="hi2">Sanctify us throughout in Spirit and Soul and Body, and preserve us Blameless to his
                  Heavenly Kingdome:</span> Come unto him, that we may be Ruled by the <span class="hi2">Scepter of his Righteousness</span>; and made <span class="hi2">Conquerors and more than Conquerors, over our Spiritual Adversaries.</span> And thus, we are to take an <span class="hi2">Oath of Fidelity</span> unto our Lord, Vowing that we will <span class="hi2">Fight</span> under his <span class="hi2">Banners,</span> and Begging that he would make us <span class="hi2">Faithful to the Death.</span></p>
            <p class="p"><span class="hi2">III.</span> Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is a thing that calleth for the <span class="hi2">Whole Soul,</span> and all proper motions of the Soul, to be engaged in it. As in Praising of God, it
               is the Rule, in <span class="hi2">Psal.</span> 103.1. <span class="hi2">Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me, Praise his Holy Name</span>; so in coming to Christ, the same Rule is to be observed; <span class="hi2">It must be done with the whole Soul, and all that is within us.</span> The mind, the will, the Affections, and all the Powers of the Soul, are to be concerned in this <span class="hi2">Work of God.</span> As now,
            </p>
            <p class="p">First, It is with a certain <span class="hi2">Perswasion</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to come unto him. When we come unto the Lord <span class="pb">84</span> Jesus Christ, we must Firmly <span class="hi2">Believe</span> all the Discoveries and Revelations, which God has given of him; and we should come
               to the Attainment of the Apostle, in 2. <span class="hi2">Tim</span> 1 12. <span class="hi2">I know whom I have believed, and I am perswaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him.</span> We are to be well perswaded of the Excellent Qualities i<span class="gap1">•</span> our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come <span class="gap1">•</span>nto <span class="gap1">•</span>im, and we are to be more than <span class="hi2">Al<span class="gap1">•</span>ost perswaded,</span> that <span class="hi2">In Him there does all Fulness dwell.</span> There are especially four perswasions which we are to Entertain, about our Lord Jesus
               Christ: or else we shall be <span class="hi2">Lame</span> in our Coming unto Him. One is, <span class="hi2">That He is Able to Save unto the uttermost, all that Come unto God, by Him.</span> A Second is, <span class="hi2">That there is none other Name under Heaven, given among men, whereby we must be Saved.</span> A Third is, <span class="hi2">That whosoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise Cast him out.</span> A Fourth is, <span class="hi2">That he who Believeth, shall be Saved.</span> All of these, must be Look'd upon as most <span class="hi2">Faithful Sayings</span>; and we must be ready to venture all the Interests of our Immortal Souls upon them.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Secondly, It is with a fervent <span class="hi2">Petition</span> to the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to Come unto Him. The posture wherein we should
               come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is upon our <span class="hi2">Knees:</span> and we should present <span class="pb">85</span> our prayers before him, as did the leper, in <span class="hi2">Marc.</span> 1.40. <span class="hi2">He came to him, Beseeching Him, and kneeling down to him.</span> Tis in the Quality of <span class="hi2">Petitioners</span>; yea, and of <span class="hi2">Poor</span> ones too, that we are to <span class="hi2">sue</span> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come unto him. As a <span class="hi2">Beggar</span> Petitions for an <span class="hi2">Alms,</span> or, as a <span class="hi2">Prisoner</span> for his <span class="hi2">Life,</span> so are we to Importune of our Lord Jesus Christ; that He would be concerned for our
               good. The Petitions with which the miserable besought the healing miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
               in the days of His flesh, are to be imitated in the Requests which we should make
               unto Him for our Souls. We are to intreat of Him, <span class="hi2">Lord, I am so Blind, that I cannot see the things of my Peace; Help this Blindness</span>! We are to Entreat of Him, <span class="hi2">Lord, I am so Lame, that I cannot Run the Way of thy Commandments; Help this Lameness</span>! We are to intreat, <span class="hi2">Lord, I have a Soul grievously vexed with the Divel; O cast this evil Spirit out.</span> Yea, we are to entreat, <span class="hi2">Lord, I am Dead in Trespasses and sins; O thou that canst Raise the Dead, Make my
                  Soul to Live</span>! This is fitt Language to visit a Jesus
            </p>
            <p class="p">Thirdly, We must come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, with a Lively <span class="hi2">Dependence</span> on him. When we come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to Rely upon him for the Communication of all that <span class="hi2">Blessedness,</span> whereof <span class="pb">86</span> He has encouraged our expectation. When we have commited all our Soul-concerns into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ<span class="g2">▪</span> we are to make a conclusion like <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span>. 25.2. <span class="hi2">O my God, I trust in thee, <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> be Ashamed.</span> We must with a <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> and <span class="hi2">Chearfulness</span> of Soul, <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> upon the Lord Jesus Christ, that <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> certainly do for us, all the Thing <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> in the <span class="hi2">Word, whereon He has <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> to Hope.</span> Having first Confessed, <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> Lord <span class="hi2">can,</span> and then Implored, <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> <span class="hi2">would,</span> be our Sufficient Redee<span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> should then Comfort our selves <span class="gap1">〈…〉</span> that He <span class="hi2">will</span> be so. We should now with a sweet Acquiescence of Soul, wait upon him, for <span class="hi2">Grace,</span> for <span class="hi2">Glory,</span> for <span class="hi2">every Good Thing.</span> There is a certain <span class="hi2">Rest</span> of Soul to be Endeavoured, as well as to be Propounded, in our Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ: the last <span class="hi2">Step</span> of our <span class="hi2">Coming</span> to Him, is accompanied with a <span class="hi2">Leaning</span> on Him; and a saying, <span class="hi2">Why art thou disquieted within me, O my Soul! Hope in the Almighty and the Compassionate Jesus; for He will bring thee unto the Praises of God for
                  ever.</span> Like the ancient Psalmist, having first with bitter strivings pleaded before the Lord
               Jesus Christ, <span class="hi2">O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver my Soul</span>! then conclude, <span class="hi2">Return to thy Rest, O my Soul, for the Lord will deal bountifully with thee.</span></p>
            <p class="p"><span class="pb">87</span>IV. Being thoroughly Apprehensive, that we have no <span class="hi2">strength</span> to <span class="hi2">come</span> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should first <span class="hi2">Cry</span> for that Strength, and then <span class="hi2">Try</span> whether we cannot come. As for us, we <span class="hi2">cannot</span> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; altho' our Precious and Immortal Souls do justly
               lie at the Stake, if we <span class="hi2">Do not come.</span> And we never shall <span class="hi2">Come</span> unto the Lord Jesus Christ aright, until we do with much anguish of Soul, see that
               we cannot <span class="hi2">come</span> or <span class="hi2">stir</span> towards Him. Nothing renders men more Incapable of a due <span class="hi2">Coming</span> to the Lord Jesus Christ, than a vain and a proud <span class="hi2">Opinion</span> of a <span class="hi2">Free will</span> in themselves, of it self able to Do this <span class="hi2">Good Work</span>; Or than forgetting, <span class="hi2">That in all Salvation-work, it is God who works in us, both to Will and to Do, of
                  His own good pleasure.</span> 'Tis very unlikely, That God should give us the <span class="hi2">Faith</span> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, unless we subscribe to that, in <span class="hi2">Eph.</span> 2.8. <span class="hi2">Faith is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</span> It is not likely that God should bestow upon us the <span class="hi2">Power</span> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without making us to own that in <span class="hi2">Eph.</span> 1.19. <span class="hi2">We Believe, according to the working of His mighty Power.</span> It was hardly a stranger thing to see <span class="hi2">Peter</span> walking on the Sea,, than to see a Sinner coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. O be sensible
               of this accursed <span class="hi2">Impotency</span>! but at the same time see, that without the <span class="hi2">Grace</span> of <span class="pb">88</span> God we cannot so much as arrive to be thus far sensible. And yet there are two<span class="g2">▪</span> Things from which we should not be hereby discouraged.
            </p>
            <p class="p">First, We are to <span class="hi2">Cry</span> that God would help us to come. When we are advised of such a thing as that in <span class="hi2">John.</span> 6.44. <span class="hi2">No man can come unto me, Except the Father which hath sent me, Draw Him</span>: It becomes us then humbly and warmly, to make that moan unto him, in <span class="hi2">Cant.</span> 5.4. <span class="hi2">O Draw me</span>! We cannot <span class="hi2">come</span> to the Lord Jesus Christ, until we <span class="hi2">Turn</span>; but how should we do <span class="hi2">That</span>? That we may <span class="hi2">Turn,</span> the way is to <span class="hi2">Cry</span>; make that <span class="hi2">Cry,</span> in Jer. <span class="gap1">•</span>1.18. <span class="hi2">Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</span> O Ly before the Lord, and mourn before him, saying, <span class="hi2">Lord, I perish, and it is Just I should perish, if I do not come unto thee; but yet
                  I cannot come; a Stone may as soon fly to Heaven, and become a Star in Heaven, as
                  I of my self come to my Heavenly Lord; O do thou then Help me to come, and so Grace, Grace, will have all the
                  Glory.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Secondly; Now <span class="hi2">Try</span> whether God will not help us to come Attempt, I say; See, as the well-disposed man,
               at length got so far as in Marc. 9.27. <span class="hi2">To say with Tears, Lord, I Believe, Help mine Unbelief!</span> So, see whether you cannot say, <span class="hi2">Lord, now at Last I come! Lord, now at Last, I can trust my <span class="pb">89</span> Soul in thy Hands, for thee to make me Happy for ever.</span> We find, that the man with a <span class="hi2">Withered Hand</span> in Math. 12.13. when he <span class="hi2">Try'd,</span> could <span class="hi2">Stretch</span> it out; Even so, Let us <span class="hi2">Try,</span> whether the <span class="hi2">Withered Foot</span> of our Souls be not Cured by the <span class="hi2">Soveraign Grace</span> of God; and whether we cannot come to what we never could of our selves come unto.
            </p>
            <p class="p">V. They that will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, must Answer and Conquer all the <span class="hi2">Objections</span> of unbeleef, against coming to the Lord. You may be sure that when our Faces are once
               Christ-ward, many <span class="hi2">Obstacles</span> will be cast before us, by <span class="hi2">An evil heart of unbeleef.</span> But as the ways to the <span class="hi2">City of Refuge,</span> were Exactly and carefully cleared, among the <span class="hi2">Israelites</span> of old, so must we do what we can to clear out of the way those things that might
               hinder us, in <span class="hi2">Flying for Refuge to the Hope set before us.</span> As now,
            </p>
            <p class="p">Tis one objection of unbeleef, <span class="hi2">Thy sins are so Extraordinarily Circumstanced, that if thou shouldest come unto the
                  Lord Jesus Christ, it is Impossible thou shouldest be welcome unto that Holy Lord.</span> Let our Answer to this objection, be, <span class="hi2">that</span> in 1. <span class="hi2">Tim.</span> 1.15. <span class="hi2">Jesus Christ came into the world to Save sinners, of whom I am Chief.</span> 'Tis for <span class="hi2">Sinners,</span> that our Lord is become a <span class="hi2">Saviour; They</span> are the <span class="hi2">Si<span class="gap1">•</span>k Ones,</span> whom He is a <span class="hi2">Physician</span> for<span class="g2">▪</span> <span class="pb">90</span> and the worse, the deeper, the older their <span class="hi2">Sickness</span> is, the more will be His <span class="hi2">Glory</span> in the Saving of them. Tho' we are <span class="hi2">Great Sinners,</span> yet we may plead it with Him, that He is, <span class="hi2">A Great Saviour.</span> 'Tis true, we have been <span class="hi2">Ready to sin</span>; but it is said of God in Jesus Christ, <span class="hi2">Thou art Ready to Pardon.</span> 'Tis true, we have <span class="hi2">sinned abundantly</span>; but it is said of our Lord, <span class="hi2">He will abundantly pardon.</span> It was of old thrown upon Him as his Disgrace, <span class="hi2">He Receiveth Sinners</span>; but it is his Honour, His Renown. His <span class="hi2">Blood,</span> is, <span class="hi2">A Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness</span>; the most polluted Creature among us all, may have Recourse to that <span class="hi2">Open Fountain.</span> And, as long as we are not come to be such Apostates, Blasphemers, and Persecutors, as to Hate the <span class="hi2">Blood</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, we may be sure that we are not fallen into the <span class="hi2">Unpardonable sin.</span> Yea, if we are but <span class="hi2">Afraid</span> of that Sin, 'tis a sign that we are not <span class="hi2">Fallen</span> into it. He has already Received, not only to His <span class="hi2">Mercy,</span> but also to His <span class="hi2">Kingdom,</span> such as have been Guilty of the very same Sins, that now astonish our Consciences:
               He has Received a <span class="hi2">Menasseh</span>; He has Received a <span class="hi2">Mary Magdalene.</span> Is it the Sin of <span class="hi2">Uncleanness,</span> that affrights us? Remember, By <span class="hi2">Faith</span> Rahab <span class="hi2">the Harlot perished not.</span> Is it the Sin of <span class="hi2">Thievery,</span> that <span class="pb">91</span> affrights us; Remember, The <span class="hi2">Thief on the Cross.</span> Yea, Murder, and the <span class="hi2">Murder</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, did not put some out of Reach to the <span class="hi2">Mercy</span> of that Blessed Lord.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Tis Another objection of unbeleef, <span class="hi2">Thou art not so prepared for the Lord Jesus Christ, as that thou mayest without presumption
                  dare to come unto him.</span></p>
            <p class="p">To this objection let us give <span class="hi2">that</span> Answer, in <span class="hi2">Rev.</span> 22.17. <span class="hi2">Lest him that is athirst, come, &amp; whosoever will, Let him take the water of Life Freely.</span> What is the true <span class="hi2">End</span> of all those <span class="hi2">Preparations</span> that are undergone by the Elect of God, in their coming unto the Lord Jesus Christ?
               they are that we may be made <span class="hi2">willing</span> to come. So then, if we do but find our selves <span class="hi2">willing</span> to have the Lord Jesus Christ, we need not scruple our liberty to come unto him. Are
               we so affected with our <span class="hi2">Ignorance,</span> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ should be our <span class="hi2">Wisdom</span>? Are we so concerned about our <span class="hi2">Guiltiness,</span> as that we are willing to have <span class="hi2">Righteousness</span> by our Lord Jesus Christ? Are we so troubled for our <span class="hi2">Pollutions,</span> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, should be our <span class="hi2">Sanctification? Is</span> our <span class="hi2">Captivity</span> so Irksome to us, that we are willing to have <span class="hi2">Redemption</span> by the Lord Jesus Christ? Then <span class="hi2">Come,</span> in Gods Name; say not, <span class="hi2">Shall I? <span class="pb">92</span> May</span> I? but, <span class="hi2">Come,</span> without any further Hesitation. We must not imagine to come unto our Lord Jesus Christ,
               with any Recommendation but that of our being <span class="hi2">wretched and miserable, and poor and blind and Naked.</span> It is not under the Notion of <span class="hi2">prepared,</span> but under the Notion of <span class="hi2">perishing</span> Sinners, that we are to come unto Him. We would fain come unto Him <span class="hi2">with,</span> such and such good Frames in our Souls; but we are to come unto Him <span class="hi2">for,</span> what we cannot come unto Him <span class="hi2">with.</span> Never stand pausing, whether you have undergone such Degrees of <span class="hi2">Compunction</span> and <span class="hi2">Contrition</span>; beware lest you make a <span class="hi2">Christ</span> of those things; but if you <span class="hi2">can</span> come, <span class="hi2">Do</span>; or however <span class="hi2">Do</span> what you <span class="hi2">can</span> to come. Do not say, <span class="hi2">Lord, Depart from me, for I am sinful man</span>; but say, <span class="hi2">Lord, because</span> I <span class="hi2">am a sinful man, therefore</span> I <span class="hi2">will come unto thee.</span> Or argue at such a rate as the Lepers did, <span class="hi2">Be sure, if</span> I <span class="hi2">sit still,</span> I <span class="hi2">dy</span>; I <span class="hi2">may go forth and live: If</span> I <span class="hi2">stay from the Lord Jesus Christ,</span> I <span class="hi2">am ruined unavoidably; but</span> I <span class="hi2">may come to Him, and have a good reception with Him: so this I'll do</span>!
            </p>
            <p class="p">VI. Because we have hearts most unaccountably <span class="hi2">Lothe</span> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should lay before our selves all sit <span class="hi2">Incentives,</span> to Provoke us, and Excite us thereunto. Tis <span class="hi2">Prodigious</span>; but yet it is <span class="hi2">Notorious</span>; There is nothing in the world <span class="pb">93</span> whereto we are more Indisposed, than unto Believing unto the Lord Jesus Christ. Alas<span class="g2">▪</span> How often do we put our Lord, upon making that Lamentation over us, in Mat. 23.37. <span class="hi2">Ye would not!</span> But it becomes us therefore to stir and spur up our own Souls, with very penetrating Thoughts upon this matter, till having no other way to betake our selves but un<span class="gap1">••</span> the Lord Jesus Christ, we are <span class="hi2">Shut up unto the Faith.</span> May we then Retire, and ponder upon this <span class="hi2">Path of Life</span>! There,
            </p>
            <p class="p">Let our first Consideration be This: <span class="hi2">Who is it, that Invites thee, O my Soul, yea, who is it, that Requires thee to come
                  unto Him!</span> It is no Less an One than the <span class="hi2">King</span> of Heaven, the <span class="hi2">Lord</span> of Glory, and the <span class="hi2">Son</span> of God. O Heart of Adamant, that can Refuse the Favours of such an Illustrious <span class="hi2">Monarch</span>! 'Tis a greater than the Emperor of the World, that H<span class="gap1">•</span>lds out His <span class="hi2">Golden Scepter</span> unto us; and says, <span class="hi2">Come, Sinners, you may Come and Live!</span> 'Tis He that is, <span class="hi2">Mighty to Save,</span> who bids us to Draw near unto Him, that we may be <span class="hi2">Saved</span> by Him; 'Tis He that is the <span class="hi2">Des<span class="gap1">•</span>re of all Nations,</span> who <span class="hi2">Desires</span> us, that we would but be willing to be Saved. This Great Person, whom all the Angels
               in Heaven Worship, 'tis <span class="hi2">He</span> that has called for our coming unto Him; and He has <span class="pb">94</span> not only <span class="hi2">Invited,</span> but also <span class="hi2">Required</span> our doing so. If it be demanded of you, <span class="hi2">How dare you come unto the Lord Jesus Christ?</span> You may with all Humility Reply, <span class="hi2">Because I dare do no other?</span> The <span class="hi2">Winds,</span> the <span class="hi2">Seas,</span> the very <span class="hi2">Devils,</span> were Obedient unto our Humbled Jesus: and how dare we be Disobedient unto our Exalted <span class="hi2">Prince</span> and <span class="hi2">Saviour,</span> when He comman<span class="gap1">••</span>, <span class="hi2">Come unto me, that you may have Repentance and Remission of Sins!</span></p>
            <p class="p">Let our next Consideration be, <span class="hi2">Shall</span> I <span class="hi2">be a Looser by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ? No, shall I not.</span> The Wise Man said, <span class="hi2">Of Labour there is Profit</span>; but there is no <span class="hi2">Profit</span> like that of this <span class="hi2">Labour.</span> Let us come to our Lord; we shall find no mistake in that of the Psalmist, <span class="hi2">It is good for me to Draw near unto God</span>! This Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is the most considerable Thing in that, <span class="hi2">Godliness which is profitable to all things.</span> Come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately, the God of Heaven will say to you, <span class="hi2">Be of Good Chear, thy sins are forgiven thee</span>! Immediately the same God of Heaven, will say, <span class="hi2">This is a Dear Son, this is a pleasant Child, I will surely have mercy on him</span>! You will immediately be Entituled unto all the <span class="hi2">Great and Precious Promises</span> of God; whatever has been purchased by the Invaluable <span class="pb">95</span> Blood of the precious Jesus, you may now write upon it, <span class="hi2">It is all mine</span>; the God of Heaven will show you all the Good Things of Heaven it self, and say unto
               you, as once unto <span class="hi2">Abraham, All of these things will</span> I <span class="hi2">give unto thee</span>! Ah, Rock indeed, that such a Motive will not break!
            </p>
            <p class="p">Let our Third Consideration be, <span class="hi2">What will become of me, if</span> I <span class="hi2">do not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ</span>! Or, <span class="hi2">How shall</span> I <span class="hi2">Escape, if</span> I <span class="hi2">neglect so great Salvation</span>? It is most Evident, That as there is more Glory given to God, by coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, than in keeping all the <span class="hi2">Law</span>; for God more Eminently manifested His Glory in the way of our being Saved by Jesus
               Christ, than in Giving of the <span class="hi2">Law</span>; so, our Denying to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is the most horrid Act of Enmity
               and Rebellion against the Glorious God. Men must sin in some Instance above the <span class="hi2">Devil,</span> or else God would not Eternally punish them with the <span class="hi2">Devil</span>; now this is done in Refusing to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ: And assuredly,
               and accordingly will it be Avenged! What is, <span class="hi2">A portion with Unbl<span class="gap1">•</span>evers,</span> but the most fiery, hideous <span class="hi2">Portion,</span> in the Dismal Vault below? O <span class="hi2">come</span> now unto the Lord Jesus Christ, or else look to hear Him say, <span class="hi2">Depart,</span> <span class="pb">96</span> in the dreadful Day of God, with a voice more terrible than the most ast<span class="gap1">••</span>ishing Thunder? <span class="hi2">Come</span> to Him, or else Resolve to <span class="hi2">Ly</span> for ever under that Formi<span class="gap1">•</span>able <span class="hi2">wrath to come,</span> from whence he would have <span class="hi2">delivered</span> us: Resolve to we<span class="gap1">•••</span>r under the Fierce <span class="hi2">wrath of God abiding on us</span>; World without End.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Finally, Let this one thing more be considered with us. <span class="hi2">I have now a Time to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; and I know not how long this
                  time will be continued.</span> Or, <span class="hi2">Behold now is my acceptable time, Behold now is my day of Salvation!</span> Suppose we ourselves to be urged from Heaven as was <span class="hi2">Paul</span> of old, <span class="hi2">Arise, why tarriest thou</span>! As yet it is not altogether <span class="hi2">Too late</span>; Blessed be God, for His long-suffering; as yet we may come; it may yet be <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>, <span class="hi2">The Master calleth thee</span>! But it will quickly, shortly, presently be <span class="hi2">too late.</span> Eterni<span class="gap1">•</span>y is just going to fasten its Iron Teeth upon our Soul<span class="gap1">•</span>. Defer no more, Dally no more, Procras<span class="gap1">•</span>inate no Longer. A <span class="hi2">Dilatory</span> Dispo<span class="gap1">•</span>ition of Soul, is the most <span class="hi2">Dangerous</span> that can befall us. Dream not of, <span class="hi2">A more convenient Season,</span> for there is no <span class="hi2">Season</span> so <span class="hi2">conv<span class="gap1">•••</span>ent</span> as just <span class="hi2">now.</span> Bring this then to the <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span>; <span class="hi2">I must save my self to Night, or to Morrow I may be slain</span>! What said the Lord by the Apostle? <span class="hi2">To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</span> Pray, take notice, <span class="pb">97</span> we have <span class="hi2">This Day,</span> the kind Messages of our Lord Jesus Christ, bespeaking and alluring of us, <span class="hi2">this day,</span> to come unto him.

               <p class="p">To Conclude, Let this one Consideration, at last put an edge upon this matter with
                  us: That the Last <span class="hi2">Sentence</span> upon the world, will be, either <span class="hi2">Come,</span> or<span class="g2">▪</span> <span class="hi2">Go,</span> according to your present Closure, with the Invitations of the Gospel. The Day flyes
                  towards <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> <span class="gap1">•</span>pace, when the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Heaven, will descend from Heaven, into
                  the Lower World, and sit upon the <span class="hi2">Throne of Glory</span> to <span class="hi2">Judge</span> all the Nations of the World. Let me now plainly and freely, foretel unto my Hearers, the Door which they shall then Receive at the Glorious Mouth of him
                  who shall then <span class="hi2">Judge the world in Righteousness.</span></p>
               <p class="p">There are <span class="hi2">some</span> of you, that now yield the <span class="hi2">Obedience of Faith</span> to the Invitations of the Eternal Jesus.

Well, the Lord Jesus Christ will in the Notable Day of God, put marks <span class="pb">98</span> of Respect and Honour upon every one of you, to whom He is now <span class="hi2">Precious</span>; and He will pass this Sentence on you.

You Resisted the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God, when He would have been <span class="hi2">Melting</span> of you to a Compliance with the Lord of Heaven; but that Abused <span class="pb">101</span> <span class="hi2">Spirit,</span> will now be most exquisitely and continually <span class="hi2">Sca<span class="gap1">•••</span>ing</span> of you, in the <span class="hi2">Fire</span> of Hell, for your Non-Compliance.

               <p class="p">Oh! Consider of it! and over-hear the Lord Jesus now saying over you, <span class="hi2">He th<span class="gap1">••</span> Cometh not unto me, wrongeth his own Soul; all that slight me, Love Death.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Well, And what Resolutions have you now taken up? Will you see whether after all your sins you can <span class="hi2">come</span> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that he may <span class="hi2">Save</span> you from your <span class="hi2">Sins</span>? Or, will you still Expose your selves to <span class="hi2">wrath unto the uttermost,</span> because you will not <span class="hi2">Come</span> unto him, that would <span class="hi2">Save</span> you <span class="hi2">to the uttermost</span>?

               <p class="p">You are to <span class="hi2">come,</span> unto the Lord Jesus Christ; but what for? Why, 'Tis that you may be <span class="hi2">Married</span> unto Him.

                  To <span class="hi2">Come</span> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, indeed is but thus much; 'tis, <span class="hi2">To be willing that the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, should Unite us unto Himself,
                     and Make us, and Use us as His Own, in the Everlasting Covenant.</span> Oh! What Prodigies of Madness and Hardness are we, if we don't fall in with such Propositions!

               </div>
            </div>
            <p class="p">THere is a Wonderful and a Notable <span class="hi2">World of Spirits,</span> whereto we are all of us Travelling, through a <span class="pb">106</span> <span class="hi2">State of Probation,</span> which our God has appointed for us; and that we may be assisted in our <span class="hi2">Preparation</span> for that GREAT WORLD, it is necessary that we should be furnished with some true Notions
               of it. But while we are <span class="hi2">Clothed</span> with <span class="hi2">Flesh,</span> the Notions of <span class="hi2">Spiritual</span> Concerns, are most easily conveyed unto us, by <span class="hi2">Metaphors</span> fetch'd from such Objects, as do by our <span class="hi2">Flesh</span> become sensible unto us; and the Beams of <span class="hi2">Light</span> must come unto us from that <span class="hi2">Other World,</span> with some <span class="hi2">Clothing</span> from this upon them. Now Almighty God, Condescending in His Instructions to our Capacities,
               has been pleased Himself, to Intimate and as it were to Consecrate, certain <span class="hi2">Metaphors,</span> for the use of our understandings, in shaping our Conceptions of such things as otherwise
               would be <span class="hi2">Unutterable,</span> and He has pitched upon diverse things of common and famous use in Humane affairs,
               giving us this Direction thereupon, <span class="hi2">Make those things the Figures from whence your Thoughts are to take their Measures, when you go to apprehend, the Deep things of God.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Among the Profound <span class="hi2">Mysteries,</span> whereof our Merciful God has Mercifully advised us, One is, <span class="hi2">That Everlasting and Immutable Counsel of His, whereby He has Chosen a Certain and
                  Special Number of Men, to be Vessels for the Glory of His Grace forever, with an Eternal
                  Reprobation <span class="pb">107</span> passing over others.</span> Now the Emblem or Shadow, under which our God would give us notice of this Glorious <span class="hi2">Mystery,</span> is that of, A BOOK, wherein we may Imagine Entred, the Names of such as are to be Saved by the Lord Jesus Christ. Suppose
               a <span class="hi2">Daniel,</span> a <span class="hi2">Paul,</span> a <span class="hi2">John</span> might on this Side the Third Heaven, have enjoyed a <span class="hi2">Vision</span> of the Eternal Election, passing upon the Heirs of <span class="hi2">Life,</span> that Election would not have been otherwise than under the Shape and Form of, A BOOK, represented unto them. And the
               mention of A BOOK, in this case, may be supposed an allusion to the Publick <span class="hi2">Registers,</span> used in Cities, Countreys, Kingdomes, and with almost all the Civilized Nations of this World; where the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of such as might have any claim to future Priviledges, are usually Enrolled. The Ancient <span class="hi2">Israel</span> of God, had most particularly their <span class="hi2">Books,</span> wherein they that could not find their <span class="hi2">Names</span> Inserted, were debarred from such Advantages as they which were therein Recorded,
               might pretend unto. Now the BOOK of <span class="hi2">Life,</span> which indeed like our <span class="hi2">Life, is Hid with God<span class="g2">▪</span> in Christ,</span> is Gods Decree of <span class="hi2">Election,</span> wherein these and those men, are from all Eternity with a most particular Designation, <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> apart for the Obtaining of <span class="hi2">Life</span> Eternal. We read in Acts. 17, 48. About, <span class="hi2">As <span class="pb">108</span> many as are Ordained unto Eternal Life</span> Now the Eternal <span class="hi2">Choice</span> of God, is that <span class="hi2">Book,</span> wherein the Names of all that are thus <span class="hi2">Ordained,</span> are most particularly Noted. The Decree of God, which has all that are to <span class="hi2">Live</span> Happily for ever, as particularly, as if by <span class="hi2">Name</span> Remembred in it: This is the <span class="hi2">Book of Life.</span> And this <span class="hi2">Book</span> is in our Text here Exhibited unto us, as containing the <span class="hi2">Catalogue</span> of all the persons, who at the Approaching <span class="hi2">Day of Judgement,</span> shall Escape, <span class="hi2">The Vengeance of Eternal Fire.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Concerning this Illustrious BOOK of <span class="hi2">Life,</span> there are two Assertions to be Advanced, for the Introducing of the most weighty <span class="hi2">Case,</span> that ever demanded your meditations.
            </p>
            <p class="p">One Assertion is, That no man having His <span class="hi2">Name</span> once written in the BOOK of Life, shall or can, ever have it <span class="hi2">Blotted</span> out again. Gods BOOK will never have any <span class="hi2">Blot</span>: but it is the Purpose and Promise of God concerning eve<span class="gap1">•</span>y man, that has his <span class="hi2">Name</span> in that <span class="hi2">BOOK, Rev.</span> 8.5. I <span class="hi2">will not Blot his name out of the Book of Life.</span> If a Mortal Man could say concerning what he had written on the <span class="hi2">Cross</span> of our Lord, <span class="hi2">What <span class="gap1">•</span> have written,</span> I <span class="hi2">have written</span>: Much more will the Immortal God say, upon what He hath written in His Book about
               them <span class="pb">109</span> that are to have <span class="hi2">Life,</span> by the <span class="hi2">Death</span> of our Lord, on that <span class="hi2">Cross, What I have Written, I have Written; and it shall never be Liable to the Least Obliteration.</span> This was the Old <span class="hi2">Austins</span> way of arguing.
            </p>
            <p class="p">'Tis true, that <span class="hi2">Moses</span> pleading for Sinful <span class="hi2">Israel,</span> said, in Exod. 32.33. <span class="hi2">If thou wilt, Forgive their Sin, and if not, Blot me, I pray thee, out of this Book,
                  which thou hast Written:</span> I Insist not on that which many, and especially Jewish Interpreters, assign as the
               meaning of those words; That they refer to the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of the Law, or the Pentateuch, where the Name of <span class="hi2">Moses</span> does <span class="hi2">Live</span> Renowned unto all Generations; <span class="hi2">q. d. I am willing it should never be Read or Known, that there was a man of my Name
                  in the World.</span> But it is possible, that the Man of God, might refer to the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of <span class="hi2">Life Temporal,</span> not the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of <span class="hi2">Life Eternal</span>; there is a <span class="hi2">Book of Providence,</span> which has in it the Names of such as are to <span class="hi2">Out-Live</span> the Wasting Plagues, that are to come upon their Neighbours; now says <span class="hi2">Moses, Let me rather now Dy my self, than that thy Name should be Dishonoured in thy
                  Blo<span class="gap1">••</span>ing out the Names of all this people from the Number of the Living.</span> This was the sense, by <span class="hi2">Jerom</span> and others of the Ancients put upon those words of <span class="hi2">Moses</span>; and it is a Sense which the Context smiles very much <span class="pb">110</span> upon. But suppose that the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of Election was intended in the words of <span class="hi2">Moses</span>; the Heroic Love and Zeal of that Saint, for the People of God, might passionately propound, an <span class="hi2">Impossible Thing,</span> in the pursuance of a <span class="hi2">Possi<span class="gap1">•</span>le.</span> Our Lord Himself in His Agoni<span class="gap1">••</span> mentioned such a Thing, and added, <span class="hi2">Father, If it be possible.</span> What if in the Efforts of his Ardors, <span class="hi2">Moses</span> might say, <span class="hi2">Lord, rather than this People should perish, I could be content, if that were possible,
                  to loose the Happiness, provided, I may not also Lose the Holiness, of my own Eternal Salvation!</span> 'Tis but like the Carriage of a Charitable Brother, who Beseeching his Father to be
               Reconciled unto an Undutiful Son, should plead, <span class="hi2">Sir, Either pardon this my faulty Brother, or else Run me through with your Sword</span>! a Thing which he knows will never be done. This, as to <span class="hi2">Moses.</span></p>
            <p class="p">There is indeed a <span class="hi2">Negative</span> Deletion out of Gods Book, sometimes mentioned in the Oracles of God; but not, a <span class="hi2">Positive.</span> When we Read such places, as <span class="hi2">Psal.</span> 69.28. and Rev. 22.19. about mens being <span class="hi2">Blotted out of Gods Book,</span> the meaning of it is, That God will make it appear, they have never been at all <span class="hi2">Written</span> there. To affirm, that any one man, whom <span class="hi2">God hath Appointed not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ</span>; may happen <span class="pb">111</span> afterwards to be Blotted out of the Glorious <span class="hi2">Last</span> which the Decree of God has made of His Elect, <span class="hi2">this</span> were a Tenet big with Many and Grievous Blasphemies. The Decree of God, indeed Orders
               a million of Things, that are <span class="hi2">Conditionate,</span> one unto another; but the Decree it self is not <span class="hi2">Conditionate</span>; no, it absolutely determines, as well the <span class="hi2">End,</span> as all the <span class="hi2">Means</span> Leading to that <span class="hi2">End.</span> The God of Heaven has Decreed, that such and such men, shall arrive unto Eternal Blessedness; of
               all whom, I may say, as <span class="hi2">Paul</span> about some of them, in <span class="hi2">Phil.</span> 4.3. <span class="hi2">Their Names are in the Book of Life.</span> But God has also Decreed that every one of these men shall certainly Repent, and certainly Believe, and
               in that way arrive to this Blessedness; nor can any one of these men, by perishing in Impenitent Unbelief, procure his <span class="hi2">Name</span> to be <span class="hi2">Blotted out of that Book.</span> The old Pagans feigned their <span class="hi2">Graces,</span> to be all of them Linked unto each other, by an <span class="hi2">Indissiluble Chain.</span> But the Connexions between the <span class="hi2">Graces</span> of our God, are still more Inseparable: you have them in <span class="hi2">Rom.</span> 8:30: <span class="hi2">Whom He did pred<span class="gap1">•</span>stinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also Justify'd; &amp; whom He
                  Justify'd, them He also Glorify'd.</span> This, all of this Infallibly and Unfailingly comes of, <span class="hi2">A Name written in the Book of Life</span>! The Stability of the <span class="pb">112</span> Divine Election, is a Thing every where affirmed, by the Author of that Election;
               a thousand Scriptures conspire to tell us, <span class="hi2">That the purpose of God, according to Election shall stand.</span> I Remember, that <span class="hi2">Solomon</span> says, in <span class="hi2">Prov.</span> 10.25. <span class="hi2">The Righteous is an Everlasting Foundation.</span> The Apostle <span class="hi2">Paul,</span> applies this to all the <span class="hi2">Elect.</span> They that have their Names <span class="hi2">Written in the Book of Life,</span> have a two-fold <span class="hi2">Writing</span> upon themselves; One, <span class="hi2">The Lord knows who are his</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> T'other, <span class="hi2">Let every one that Names the Name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span> Now for them that are thus written, tis said of <span class="hi2">Them,</span> with Regard unto the <span class="hi2">writing</span> in 2 <span class="hi2">Tim.</span> 2.19. They are, first, a <span class="hi2">foundation</span>; and, secondly, a <span class="hi2">Foundation of God</span>; and, Thirdly, a <span class="hi2">sure Foundation</span>; and, Fourthly, a <span class="hi2">Foundation that stands</span>; and Fifthly, a <span class="hi2">Foundation that has a Seal upon it</span>; never shall the <span class="hi2">Writing</span> of such a <span class="hi2">Foundation,</span> be scratched out! The principle of <span class="hi2">Grace,</span> which must be infused into all that have their Names in the <span class="hi2">Book,</span>, is an <span class="hi2">immortal Seed</span>; it <span class="hi2">Remains,</span> it <span class="hi2">Abides,</span> it is a <span class="hi2">Well of Water springing up into Everlasting Life.</span> The Covenant of <span class="hi2">Grace,</span> which all that have their Names in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> must be brought into, is <span class="hi2">Everlasting,</span> and <span class="hi2">Perpetual</span>; the Lord not only says, I <span class="hi2">will not Break it</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> but also says, <span class="hi2">That He will keep us from <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> so;</span> He says, <span class="hi2">I we never Leave <span class="pb">113</span> thee, nor Forsake thee.</span> All that have their Names in the <span class="hi2">Book,</span> shall be Married unto the Lord Jesus Christ; but our Lord says, <span class="hi2">I hate putting away</span>! The <span class="hi2">Power</span> of God, and the <span class="hi2">Promise</span> of God, is Engaged for, <span class="hi2">The Perseverance of the Saints</span>; and the <span class="hi2">Intercession</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be Unsuccessful, and Insufficient, if any of them should
               not at last come to be, <span class="hi2">With Him, where He is</span>!
            </p>
            <p class="p">In short, If any Name could be Really Blotted out from the <span class="hi2">Book of Life,</span> it must be, either, because that God knows not certainly who will come unto <span class="hi2">Life Eternal</span> at the last, or, because God could not confer the <span class="hi2">Grace,</span> which is Necessary to bring them unto that <span class="hi2">Life.</span> But, it is fit, that such <span class="hi2">Pelagian, Arminian, Socinian,</span> Blasphemies, become Abominable among the People of God.
            </p>
            <p class="p">But then, a Second Assertion is,</p>
            <p class="p">That a man, having his <span class="hi2">Name</span> written in the Book of Life, may by a Blessed <span class="hi2">Assurance</span> of it, be able to <span class="hi2">Read</span> it there. Our Lord, said once unto His Disciples, in Luc. 10.20: <span class="hi2">Rejoice, because your Names are written in Heaven</span>; and this is one of those things whereto He would have that Rule applyed, <span class="hi2">What I say to you, I say to all.</span> So then a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ on earth may with <span class="pb">114</span> Joy unspeakable see his Name written, <span class="hi2">In Heaven,</span> among them that, <span class="hi2">For Heaven,</span> at the last. Why are we enjoyned, in 2. <span class="hi2">Pet.</span> 1 10 <span class="hi2">Give Diligence to make your Election sure.</span> 'Tis not a certainty of the <span class="hi2">Object,</span> but a certainty of the <span class="hi2">Subject,</span> that we are directed unto the pursuance of: A man by diligence in the Exercise of
               all vertue may come to be <span class="hi2">sure</span> of this, <span class="hi2">I have my Name Written among the Eternally Elected of God.</span> The Inseparable consequents of a <span class="hi2">Name written in the Book of Life, may</span> be known by them, that have them. The <span class="hi2">Grace</span> of God, wrought in the hearts of them that have their Names in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God; this is a discernible sort of a Thing; tis compared unto <span class="hi2">Fire,</span> unto <span class="hi2">Light,</span> unto <span class="hi2">Life,</span> which make themselves evident where they are. One Good man has before now been able
               to say, <span class="hi2">Lord, I believe.</span> Another Good man has been able to say, <span class="hi2">Lord, thou knowest that I Love thee.</span> Yea, but they that are assured of such Things, may readily tell, where their <span class="hi2">Names</span> are to be found. Good men may come to say, as in 1: <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 3 14. <span class="hi2">We know that we have passed from Death to Life</span>; and this knowledge may assure them, that they have <span class="hi2">Names Written in the Book of Life.</span> It was the assurance of a <span class="hi2">Job, I know that my Redeemer lives.</span> But such a man may be also assured, that his <span class="hi2">Redeemer</span> has written him among <span class="pb">115</span> them that are to be <span class="hi2">Redeemed. It</span> was the assurance of a <span class="hi2">David, The Lord is my Shepherd</span>; but such a Man may be also assured, that the <span class="hi2">Great Shepherd</span> has written him, among the sheep of his <span class="hi2">Right-Hand.</span> It was the assurance of a <span class="hi2">Paul, The Son of God has loved me</span>; but he was then likewise assured of a Room in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> as well as in the <span class="hi2">Heart</span> of that Blessed Lord.
            </p>
            <p class="p">And this brings me to that most Important CASE. What should a Man do, that he may be <span class="hi2">Assured</span> of a Name, Written in the Book of <span class="hi2">LIFE</span>?
            </p>
            <p class="p">The Roman Historian Reports, that the Son of a Senator, understanding certain Honours
               to be decreed by the Senate for certain Souldiers, whose <span class="hi2">Names</span> were for that cause written in a <span class="hi2">Book,</span> he begg'd of his Father to let him see the <span class="hi2">Book,</span> or to tell him at least, whether his <span class="hi2">Name</span> were in the <span class="hi2">Book</span>? His Father told him, <span class="hi2">These were Secrets</span>; whereupon the Son asked, <span class="hi2">Pray, Sir, tell me the General Qualifications of them, that have their Names in the
                  Book,</span> which when the Father did, the Son perceived himself to be none of them. Truly, <span class="pb">116</span> <span class="hi2">The Book of Life,</span> is One of the, <span class="hi2">Secret Things which belong unto the Lord</span>; it were a vain and a mad curiosity, to think of Climbing Heaven for a view of <span class="hi2">That</span>; we may say of it, <span class="hi2">I cannot Read, for lo, the Book is a sealed Book</span>; but the <span class="hi2">Qualifications</span> of them that may know their <span class="hi2">Names</span> written in that Book, These are the <span class="hi2">Revealed Things, which belong unto us, and unto our Children.</span> Attend, then, while I set <span class="hi2">Them</span> a little before you; Attend, while I show you, what is like to become of you throughout Eternal Ages.
            </p>
            <p class="p">I. If a man would be Assured of a Name in the <span class="hi2">Book of Life,</span> Let him then make sure of <span class="hi2">Regeneration,</span> and of a <span class="hi2">New Life.</span> In Well Ordered Common-wealths, all that are <span class="hi2">Born</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> have their <span class="hi2">Names</span> Written in a <span class="hi2">Book,</span> designed for the Registring of such Matters. Why, God hath a <span class="hi2">Book,</span> wherein all that are <span class="hi2">New-Born</span> have their <span class="hi2">Names</span> written for ever. There is a <span class="hi2">Book</span> of Names, which is called, in Mat. 1.1: <span class="hi2">The Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ.</span> The <span class="hi2">Fathers</span> of our Lord, as to a <span class="hi2">Natural Generation,</span> have their <span class="hi2">Names</span> in that Book; but all that are Converted unto God, are as to a <span class="hi2">Spiritual Generation</span> the <span class="hi2">Children</span> of our Lord<span class="g2">▪</span> These are styled, <span class="hi2">The Seed of the Self-Offering Messiah</span>; and of these He says, <span class="pb">117</span> <span class="hi2">Behold, the Children that the Father has given me</span>! Well, All of these Children have their Names also, in, <span class="hi2">A Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ.</span> God had His Books of <span class="hi2">Genealogies</span> in <span class="hi2">Israel,</span> from which they that could not prove their Birth of such or such Parents, were put
               by from the <span class="hi2">Priesthood</span> of the Lord. Yea, but it is a <span class="hi2">New-Birth</span> alone, which will help us to find our Names in Gods Book of <span class="hi2">Genealogies.</span> There were <span class="hi2">Foolish Questions about Genealogies,</span> bandied in the Schools of the old Grammarians and Philosophers; the Apostle has <span class="hi2">Hissed</span> at those <span class="hi2">Questions</span>: but it is no <span class="hi2">Foolish Question,</span> for a man to be Inquisitive after this <span class="hi2">Genealogy, Am</span> I <span class="hi2">Born again? or No?</span> The man that is <span class="hi2">Born from Above,</span> may be sure that he has <span class="hi2">his Name written Above.</span> We read of, A <span class="hi2">New Name.</span> Thy Name was, <span class="hi2">A Child of Wrath</span>; but is thy Name now, <span class="hi2">A Child of God</span>? He that has this <span class="hi2">New Name,</span> has his <span class="hi2">Name Written in the Book of Life.</span> Let a man make sure of This, That he be a <span class="hi2">New Creature</span>; That he Think and Walk like, One come into <span class="hi2">another World</span>; That he have such a Respect unto God, biassing his <span class="hi2">Thoughts,</span> his <span class="hi2">Ends,</span> his <span class="hi2">Affections,</span> his <span class="hi2">Discourses,</span> his <span class="hi2">Behaviours,</span> as he was once a Stranger unto; To a man thus <span class="hi2">New-Born,</span> the Lord from Heaven speaks this Consolation, <span class="hi2">Son, Be of <span class="pb">118</span> Good Cheer, Thy Name is here in my Book of Life.</span> We are informed, <span class="hi2">There is Joy in Heaven among the Angels, over one Sinner that Repenteth.</span> Truly, if any of you will now come unto <span class="hi2">Repentance,</span> you may be sure, the <span class="hi2">Angels</span> of God will have your <span class="hi2">Names</span> presently among them; the Angels of God will sing and say, <span class="hi2">Now we know the Name of one person more that must come to Live with us for ever.</span></p>
            <p class="p">II. Let a man Subscribe his <span class="hi2">Name</span> to Gods <span class="hi2">Covenant,</span> and he may be Assured, that he has his <span class="hi2">Name</span> Written in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God. It is said in Exod. 24.7. <span class="hi2">Moses took the Book of the Covenant, and Read in the Audience of the People, and they
                  said, All that the Lord hath said, will we do, and be Obedient.</span> You see, there was, <span class="hi2">The Book of the Covenant</span>; Now if a man would see his <span class="hi2">Name</span> in Gods <span class="hi2">Book,</span> let him heartily Subscribe to the Covenant of God, and say, <span class="hi2">All that the Lord hath spoken in His Covenant,</span> I <span class="hi2">Approve it, and I Embrace it all.</span> I beseech you, Let your Hearts Accompany what I am going to say. There is an Offer of a New COVENANT, wherein the G<span class="gap1">•</span>d of Heaven, demands of us, <span class="hi2">Whether we will have the Lord Jehovah for our God, Renouncing the Flesh, the World,
                  and the Devil? with whatever Delights those Idols <span class="pb">119</span> propound unto us as our chief Good</span>? And, <span class="hi2">Whether we are willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only Mediator, should both
                  procure for us the Favour of this God, and also remove all the Ignorance and Enmity
                  in our Minds, that keeps us at a Distance from God</span>? Give your serious and solemn Consent, unto the Terms of this <span class="hi2">Covenant</span>: Consent, my Neighbours, Consent unto the <span class="hi2">Way of Salvation,</span> in this <span class="hi2">Covenant</span> provided for; with Conquered Souls, make this Answer, <span class="hi2">Lord,</span> I <span class="hi2">am willing to be Thine, in thy Covenant of Grace; and it is thy Grace alone that has
                  made me so.</span> Thrice and Four Times Happy Souls, your <span class="hi2">Names</span> are then undoubtedly in the <span class="hi2">Book of Life.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Yea, but that I may carry this matter a little further; what says the Prophet, in <span class="hi2">Isa</span> 44.5. <span class="hi2">One shall say, I am the Lords, <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> another shall subscribe with his hand unto <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> Lord?</span> There are some who Read it, <span class="hi2"><span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> shall give an hand-writing to be the Lords.</span> It has been the Judgment and Advice of many Divines, That it would be a profitable
               Thing, for men to have the <span class="hi2">Covenant of Grace</span> in a writing summarily laid before them, and for them with deep Resentments of Soul,
               to <span class="hi2">Sign</span> it with their <span class="hi2">Hands</span> as well as their <span class="hi2">Hearts,</span> and to keep this <span class="hi2">Act</span> forever by them, as a Perpetual Remembrancer <span class="pb">120</span> unto them, that they are the Lords. Tis not easy to make any objection, against our
               being thus <span class="hi2">Explicit,</span> in doing that, which must at least <span class="hi2">Implicitly</span> be done by all Godly men. If this now be discretly, sincerely, thoroughly done, you
               may safely conclude, <span class="hi2">The Name that I have now written at the bottom of this Covenant, <span class="gap1">•</span>is as undoubtedly written in the Book of Life, before God for ever.</span> When a man has thus <span class="hi2">by a deed<span class="gap1">•</span> of Gift</span> made over himself unto the God that made him, the <span class="hi2">Deed</span> is presently Recorded as it were in a Book of God; the man when he comes to Heaven, will
               find it there. There was a multitude of Devout Souls who came to that Resolution in <span class="hi2">Neh.</span> 9.<span class="gap1">•</span>8. <span class="hi2">We make a sure covenant and write it, and sign it.</span> And presently you have the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of them in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God; even more than fourscore of them together. Do something equivalent unto this Transaction; and then, if in any Temptation,
               afterwards you are prone to suspect, whether you have a <span class="hi2">Name written</span> in Gods Book, you may have Recourse to this evidence, for your Eternal Satisfaction.
               This <span class="hi2">Indenture</span> of yours, I tell you, has its <span class="hi2">Counterpane,</span> in the <span class="hi2">Book of Life</span>!
            </p>
            <p class="p">III. Let the <span class="hi2">Written Book</span> of God, have a due Entertainment with a man, and that will be a comfortable Token,
               that <span class="pb">121</span> he has his <span class="hi2">Name written</span> in Gods <span class="hi2">Book.</span> Our <span class="hi2">Bible</span> here, is that BOOK, whereby the Religion of God, is maintained in the World. O set
               your <span class="hi2">Hands</span> unto this Miraculous Book, saying, <span class="hi2">This do I Receive, as the Book of God and of Life.</span> 'Tis the Sanction at the close of the Bible, in Rev. 22.1<span class="gap1">•</span>. <span class="hi2">If any man shall take away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy, GOD shall
                  take away his part out of the Book of Life.</span> Well then, would you be certain of <span class="gap1">•</span> <span class="hi2">part in the Book of Life?</span> Let this most Invaluable <span class="hi2">Book,</span> in every part of it, be most invaluable with you. Visit this Book every day; and whatever
               Day you miss doing so, count that you han't seen the <span class="hi2">Sun</span> that Day; that it has been a dark, a black, and cloudy Day. Repair s<span class="gap1">••</span>ll to this <span class="hi2">Book,</span> for all that you are to <span class="hi2">Believe,</span> and for all that you are to <span class="hi2">Practise,</span> in Religion, and evermore <span class="hi2">Give Heed unto this Book, as unto a Light shining in a Dark Place.</span> As for all the <span class="hi2">Doctrines</span> in this Book, say, <span class="hi2">These are all of them Faithful Sayings, &amp; worthy of all Acceptation: Great is the
                  Mystery of Godliness contained in them.</span> As for all the <span class="hi2">Commandments</span> in this Book, say, <span class="hi2">These are all of them<span class="g2">▪</span> Holy, and Just, and Good</span>; I <span class="hi2">count these Precepts concerning all things to be Right, and</span> I <span class="hi2">would Hate every false way therein Re<span class="gap1">•••</span>ed.</span> As for all the <span class="pb">122</span> <span class="hi2">Promise<span class="gap1">•</span></span> in this Book, say, <span class="hi2">These are all of them, great and precious</span>? I <span class="hi2">have taken them for my Heritage, and they shall be the Rejoycing of my Soul.</span> As for all the <span class="hi2">Threatenings</span> of this Book, say, <span class="hi2">Lord, my Flesh Trembles for Fear of Thee, and I am Afraid of thy Judgments.</span> And<span class="g2">▪</span> as for all the <span class="hi2">Examples</span> in this Book, say, <span class="hi2">Lord, By these is thy Servant Warned.</span> Let thy heart be set upon this <span class="hi2">Book,</span> and <span class="hi2">This</span> will be a Token, that as for that other <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God, thy <span class="hi2">Name</span> is in it.
            </p>
            <p class="p">IV. Whatever man becomes a Believer on the <span class="hi2">Name</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Essential <span class="hi2">Word</span> of God, may take it for granted, that his <span class="hi2">Name</span> is in the Eternal <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God. The Lord Jesus Christ, is that Blessed Saviour, who says, in Psal. 40.7. <span class="hi2">In the Volume of the Book, it is Written of me</span>; or, as it may be read, <span class="hi2">In the Beginning of the Book.</span> Why, as the Lord Jesus Christ stands <span class="hi2">first,</span> in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of <span class="hi2">Election</span>; Even in the <span class="hi2">Beginning</span> of the <span class="hi2">Book</span>; He is the <span class="hi2">first</span> of the <span class="hi2">Chosen,</span> and then we are <span class="hi2">Chosen</span> in Him; so, if you Look into the very <span class="hi2">Beginning</span> of this visible Book, you will find, <span class="hi2">The Promised Se<span class="gap1">•</span>d of the Woman,</span> is <span class="hi2">Written</span> of; and indeed, the whole <span class="hi2">Book</span> from first to last, is <span class="hi2">written</span> to testify this Thing, <span class="hi2">That our Jesus is <span class="pb">123</span> Exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give us, both Repentance and Remission of
                  Sins.</span> Come then, Let every Soul of us, Receive the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Only Begotten and Ever-Beloved, Son of God, and as the God-man, <span class="hi2">In whom it has pleased the Father, there should all Fulness dwell.</span> By Faith Receive Him, of whom 'tis <span class="hi2">Written in the Book,</span> and we may be sure, that we our selves are also <span class="hi2">Written in the Book.</span> <span class="gap1">•</span>e we bitterly affected, with a sight of our own <span class="hi2">Sinfulness,</span> and <span class="hi2">Wretchedness,</span> and when we are even <span class="hi2">stung</span> to Death, by the Fiery Serpents of Hell, then let us effectually Hear that Call of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="hi2">Look unto Me, and be ye Saved, all the Ends of the Earth.</span> Utterly Despairing of Help for an Undone Soul, from any other Quarter, Let us fly
               to the Lord Jesus Christ, as to the <span class="hi2">Hopeful Refuge,</span> which Almighty God hath set before us: Of this <span class="hi2">Jesus,</span> Let us declare, <span class="hi2">This is He, in whose Righteousness only, I dare to appear before the Judgment Seat
                  of God</span>! Let us declare, <span class="hi2">This is He, who shall Restore my Soul, and Lead me in the Paths of Righteousness</span>! And, <span class="hi2">This is He, who shall make me a Conqueror, and more than a Conqueror, over my Ghostly
                  Adversaries</span>! Man, if this be, the Resolved Language of thy Soul, concerning the <span class="hi2">Lord</span> of <span class="hi2">Life,</span> I can here open the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of <span class="hi2">Life,</span> before thine eyes; <span class="pb">124</span> Behold, with a Joyful Soul, Thy <span class="hi2">Name</span> is written in this <span class="hi2">Book.</span> It was a dreadful Imprecation upon the <span class="hi2">Despisers</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, in Psal. 69.28. <span class="hi2">Let them be Blotted out of the Book of the Living, and not be Written with the Righteous.</span> Tremble at this, all you that have been so busy about the Trifles of this World, as
               hitherto to continue <span class="hi2">Christless</span> all your Days. But as for you, <span class="hi2">To whom Christ is Precious</span>; you may be comforted in this, that you have your <span class="hi2">Names</span> Written among the <span class="hi2">Royal Priesthood,</span> the <span class="hi2">Holy Nation,</span> the <span class="hi2">Peculiar People,</span> of the Lord.
            </p>
            <p class="p">V. He that belongs to the <span class="hi2">Mystical Body</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, may be certain that His <span class="hi2">Name</span> is written in the <span class="hi2">Mysterious Book</span> of that Lord. The Spirit of our Lord, in <span class="hi2">David,</span> having an eye to his Mystical <span class="hi2">Body,</span> saith in <span class="hi2">Psal.</span> 139.16. <span class="hi2">In thy Book, all my members were written.</span> When once a man becomes really Joined unto that <span class="hi2">Body</span> even, the whole <span class="hi2">Body</span> of <span class="hi2">Saints,</span> he may then Venture to think, <span class="hi2">I am certainly one of those that were in the Book of God, from all Eternity, Laid
                  out for the Members of Christ Mystical.</span> Yea, But how shall a man know that he belongs to the <span class="hi2">Mystical Body</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ? I'll tell you, <span class="hi2">How</span>? Are you Acted by the same <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that <span class="pb">125</span> Actuates all the Rest of His Body? Is the the Lord Jesus Christ a <span class="hi2">Quickning Spirit</span> unto <span class="hi2">you,</span> as He is unto the Rest of them, that are United unto Himself? We read of <span class="hi2">Names Written in the Earth</span>; so 'tis, When we have <span class="hi2">Hearts cleaving to the Earth.</span> Some there are, that never think, they have <span class="hi2">Earth</span> enough, and that subordinate all things to the getting of <span class="hi2">Earth.</span> Such men are strangers to the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ; God knows, whether they have <span class="hi2">Names Written in Heaven,</span> or no. But pray, mark what I say; the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, Inclines all that
               belong unto Him, To prefer a Christ above a World; and to abhor and avoid every <span class="hi2">Sin,</span> as the worst Evil in the World; It inclines them all, to prize <span class="hi2">Communion</span> with God, in the Devotions of Christianity, above all the Delights of this Life: It
               inclines them all, to do all the Good they can, unto all that are about them. Say
               now, Are you Led by this <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> of the Lord, or no? If you are, Then I say, That you are in the <span class="hi2">Holy Body</span> of the Lord. Let me add, How are you concerned for the <span class="hi2">Church</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ? Are the <span class="hi2">Joyes</span> of the Church, made your own; Are the <span class="hi2">Griefs</span> of the Church made your own: Do you Resent the Circumstances of the Church, <span class="hi2">As being your selves also in the Body?</span> Behold, another <span class="pb">126</span> Demonstration that you are <span class="hi2">Members</span> of that <span class="hi2">Body.</span> But if you will do something further to put it out of doubt; pray, Joyn your selves
               in <span class="hi2">Fellowship,</span> with a particular <span class="hi2">Church</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, walking in the Order of the Gospel. The Apostle speaks in
               Heb. 12.23. about, <span class="hi2">The General Assembly, and the Church of the First born, which are Written in Heaven.</span> 'Tis in allusion to the Church of <span class="hi2">Israel,</span> Assembled at <span class="hi2">Sinai</span> of old. This I say, if men would not remain in Doubts, whether they be <span class="hi2">Written in Heaven.</span> Let them get into some <span class="hi2">Assembly of Zion,</span> some Church of the Living God. We read in Isa. 4.3. about some, <span class="hi2">Written among the Living in Jerusalem.</span> If any man, don't count it worth the while, for him to have his <span class="hi2">Name,</span> Written in the <span class="hi2">Church-Book,</span> among them that are anew made <span class="hi2">Alive</span> by the Word of God, how should he be able to see his <span class="hi2">Name</span> written in <span class="hi2">Gods Book,</span> among them that are to <span class="hi2">Live</span> Eternally? I am verily perswaded, That God thus punishes the fault of many a Christian,
               who Lies from year to year out of <span class="hi2">Church Fellowship</span>; He punisheth it, by denying them an Assurance of an Interest, in the <span class="hi2">Book of Life.</span></p>
            <p class="p">VI. He that can see his Name written on the <span class="hi2">Breast</span> of the Lord, may plainly <span class="pb">127</span> see it also in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of the Lord. It was the usage of old, in Exod. 28.19. <span class="hi2">Aaron shall bear the Names of the Children of Israel, upon his Heart, when he goes in
                  unto the Holy Place, for a Memorial before the Lord continu<span class="gap1">•</span>ll<span class="gap1">•</span>.</span> Our Lord Jesus Christ, is our <span class="hi2">High priest,</span> gone for us into the most <span class="hi2">Holy Place</span>; and He has Engraved upon His Breast, the <span class="hi2">Names,</span> of all that are to be Saved by His Mediation. Well, Are <span class="hi2">your Names</span> among them? An Hard Interrogatory! But if you'l Hearken to <span class="hi2">me</span> a little, you shall see, whether your <span class="hi2">Names</span> are there or no. I say then, <span class="gap1">•</span>o you bear upon your <span class="hi2">Hearts,</span> the <span class="hi2">Name</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ continually? Is it your Frequent, your Daily Study, <span class="hi2">What shall I do to advance the Name of my dear Lord</span>? And is it like a Dagger at your <span class="hi2">Hearts,</span> that the Name of your Lord is Honoured so Little, or so much Blasphemed, in the World?
               Be sure, your <span class="hi2">Names</span> are upon His Heart, if his <span class="hi2">Name</span> Ly much upon yours. But, there is another Symptom, which may help you, in the Discovery:
               'tis This. Have <span class="hi2">you,</span> in your own <span class="hi2">Wishes</span> and <span class="hi2">Prayers,</span> the <span class="hi2">Echo's</span> of that Intercession, wherein our Lord carries the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of His People, before God, that they may be <span class="hi2">Saved unto the uttermost</span>? I ask you, that you would make a Liesure to look into the <span class="pb">128</span> seventeenth Chapter of <span class="hi2">John,</span> where you have a little Copy of our Lords Glorious <span class="hi2">Intercession. There,</span> when you read the Demands of our Lord, that we may be <span class="hi2">kept from the Evil of the World,</span> That we may be <span class="hi2">Sanctify'd by the Word of Truth,</span> That we may be <span class="hi2">United unto Himself, and come to be with Him, where He is, to behold His Glory, as
                  our Heaven</span>; Do you fervently and constantly, make Those your own <span class="hi2">Intercessions</span> for your selves? Can you say, <span class="hi2">Lord, Here is all my Salvation, and all my Desire</span>! Man, Thy <span class="hi2">Name,</span> is then Written among those for whom the Lord of Glory is is at this Day Interceding in his Glory.
            </p>
            <p class="p">VII. All the <span class="hi2">Servants,</span> All the <span class="hi2">Souldiers,</span> All the <span class="hi2">Friends,</span> of God, have their Names Entred in His <span class="hi2">Book,</span>; Let every man Examine himself, whether he be such an One, or no? Are you the <span class="hi2">Servants</span> of God? The King of <span class="hi2">Egypt,</span> as we Read in <span class="hi2">Genesis,</span> had a <span class="hi2">Box,</span> where was Written the Names of the <span class="hi2">Servants</span> belonging to his Houshold. Thus the King of Heaven, has a Book, wherein are the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of all His true <span class="hi2">Servants</span> written. There are some of whom it may be said, <span class="hi2">They are always at work for God</span>; and they are ever now and then contriving, <span class="hi2">What shall I do for God?</span> Let me confidently tell <span class="hi2">Them</span> <span class="pb">129</span> that are thus employed. <span class="hi2">The great God has every one of your Names before him.</span> There is not any one <span class="hi2">service,</span> that we do for our God, but it is in his Book: more exactly then ever <span class="hi2">Mordecai's</span> Fidelity was in the Persian <span class="hi2">Chronicles</span>; and surely then, every <span class="hi2">servant</span> of His, must have a Name also there. We do not let fall one <span class="hi2">Tear,</span> in our waiting upon God; but, <span class="hi2">Lord it is in thy Book!</span> and is there not also the <span class="hi2">Name</span> of him, who dropt the <span class="hi2">Tear?</span> Again, Are you the <span class="hi2">Souldiers</span> of God? <span class="hi2">Commanders</span> use to have the Names of all their <span class="hi2">Souldiers,</span> in their Catalogues, and some very memorable Generals have had such memories, as to know by Name the most of them. Truly so, the <span class="hi2">Lord of Hosts,</span> He has a <span class="hi2">Book,</span> wherein he has Listed the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of all the <span class="hi2">Souldiers,</span> that Fight <span class="gap1">•</span>nder His Banners against the enemies of His Interests. There are some, that are always
               bearing of their Testimonies for the Labouring <span class="hi2">Truths,</span> and the Neglected <span class="hi2">Wayes</span> of God, in the world; and that are alwayes morti<span class="gap1">•</span>ying in their own Souls, those, <span class="hi2">Fleshly Lusts, that war against their Souls.</span> To these also, it may be freely said, <span class="hi2">Your Names are among the Champions of the Great God.</span> We read concerning, <span class="hi2">The Book of the wars of the Lord</span>; and indeed many <span class="hi2">Worthies</span> had their Names in that Book. As for you, that faith fully set your selves, in your
               places to bear down whatever is contrary to God and <span class="pb">130</span> Christ, &amp; Grace and Piety and Charity in the world, I say, <span class="hi2">Your Names are among those worthies of the Lord.</span></p>
            <p class="p">Once more, Are you among the <span class="hi2">Friends</span> of God? It is an usual thing for a Gentleman, that is a Traveller, to have an <span class="hi2">Album,</span> or Bla<span class="gap1">•</span>k <span class="hi2">Book,</span> wherein the Names of his Friends are Inserted, with certain Memorials of them. Why, if you are the <span class="hi2">Friends</span> of God, you shall have a <span class="hi2">Name,</span> in His Book; so had <span class="hi2">Abraham, The Friend of God</span>! Keep you up an <span class="hi2">Acquaintance</span> with God? Are you never so well, as when Enlightened by the <span class="hi2">Countenance</span> of God? Are you ready to <span class="hi2">Do</span> any thing for God, that He would have to be done? O Then, He has got all your <span class="hi2">Names</span> in a Book of His! Yea, His voice unto you is that, <span class="hi2">Behold, I have Engraven thee on the Palms of my Hands, thy Wal<span class="gap1">•</span>s are continually before me</span>; Even as <span class="hi2">Jerusalem</span> was Engraven on the Rings commonly worn by persons of <span class="hi2">Quality</span> among the Jews. There was a Time when God, and Holiness, had many Enemies; but there were a few that stood up for God, and Vertue, at such a Time; Now
               'tis said, in Mal. 3.16. <span class="hi2">A Book of Remembrance, was written before Him, for Them, that Feared the Lord, and that Thought upon
                  His Name.</span> What? Are you Loth to have God offended, and are you zealous for that si<span class="gap1">•</span>e, <span class="pb">131</span> which God would have maintained? Your <span class="hi2">Names</span> are then in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of His <span class="hi2">Remembrance.</span></p>
            <p class="p">VIII. He that is a true <span class="hi2">Follower of the Lamb,</span> cannot but have his Name in the <span class="hi2">Lambs Book of Life.</span> We read in Rev. 13:8. Of some, <span class="hi2">Whose Names are not written in the Book of Life, of the Lamb.</span> It is needless to Distinguish this <span class="hi2">Book of the Lamb,</span> from the <span class="hi2">Book of Life</span>; with some, who Interpret it, as if the <span class="hi2">Lamb,</span> were the <span class="hi2">Book</span> it self. However, This may be said; The <span class="hi2">Lamb</span> of God, is in some sort a <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God, unto us; that is, we are to Learn from the pattern of the Lord Jesus Christ,
               how to form our Lives before God: The Life of that <span class="hi2">Lamb</span> is a sort of a <span class="hi2">Copy Book</span> for us, from whence we are to take the Rules of our Lives. Come then; what can you
               say to This? Can it be said of you, <span class="hi2">There is in yo<span class="gap1">•</span> the Mind that was in Jesus Christ?</span> Can it be said of you, <span class="hi2">You Walk even as Jesus Christ walked?</span> Can it be said of you, <span class="hi2">As was Christ, so you are in the World</span>? Are you often thinking, <span class="hi2">How did Christ perform such a Duty</span>? and, <span class="hi2">How did Christ endure such a Trial</span>? and are you studious of a Conformity to that Lord from Heaven? Why, That <span class="hi2">Lamb</span> of God, has then written you among his <span class="hi2">Followers.</span> Particularly, Are you the <span class="hi2">Sheep</span> of God? <span class="pb">132</span> Are you <span class="hi2">Clea<span class="gap1">•</span>ly,</span> like <span class="hi2">Sheep</span>? Are you <span class="hi2">Harmless,</span> like <span class="hi2">Sheep</span>? Are you <span class="hi2">Patient,</span> like <span class="hi2">Sheep</span>? Like <span class="hi2">Sheep,</span> are you <span class="hi2">Tractable?</span> And like <span class="hi2">Sheep,</span> do you Study, to be very <span class="hi2">profitable</span>? The <span class="hi2">Shepherd</span> of <span class="hi2">Israel</span> says in Joh. 10.3. <span class="hi2">He calls his own Sheep by Name</span>; Sirs, you are the <span class="hi2">Sheep,</span> so called, and your <span class="hi2">Names</span> are in the <span class="hi2">Book of the Lamb.</span></p>
            <p class="p">IX. Such as duly long for the Day, when the <span class="hi2">Books</span> are to be <span class="hi2">Opened,</span> will probably have their <span class="hi2">Names</span> then found, in that <span class="hi2">Book,</span> where 'tis most of all to be desired. It is foretold unto us, in Rev. 20.12. <span class="hi2">I saw the Dead, Small and Great, stand before God, and the Books were Opened; and
                  the Dead were Judged out of those Things, which were written in the Books.</span> Now can you heartily say, <span class="hi2">O That this Day might come on apace</span>! Are you Longing for that <span class="hi2">Kingdom</span> of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is to be at <span class="hi2">His Appearing to Judge the Quick and the Dead</span>? Are you Longing for the <span class="hi2">Revo <span class="gap1">•</span>ution,</span> wherein<span class="g2">▪</span> <span class="hi2">The Kingdoms of this World, shall become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ,
                  and the Time of the Dead, shall come, that they should be Judged?</span> There is a Day at Hand, when the Lord Jesus Christ shall <span class="hi2">Judge</span> the World, and make <span class="hi2">New Heavens</span> and a <span class="hi2">New Earth, wherein shall dwell Righteousness:</span> Are you now <span class="hi2">Longing,</span> <span class="pb">133</span> as well as <span class="hi2">Locking</span> for that Great <span class="hi2">DAY</span>? Do you Long for the Accomplishment of those <span class="hi2">Glorious Things which are Spoken about the City of God</span>? You pray, <span class="hi2">Thy Kingdom Come</span>; Well, Suppose the Lord Jesus Christ were immediately [<span class="hi2">And, can any man prove that it shall not be immediately?</span>] to break in upon the World, and it <span class="hi2">upon the Throne of His Glory</span>; Would your Hearts even Leap and Spring within you, at the Apprehensions of it? Surely,
               The <span class="hi2">Book of Life,</span> then to be opened, will then show you those things that shall Give you, <span class="hi2">Times of Refreshing in the Presence of the Lord.</span> I'll add but one short word more.
            </p>
            <p class="p">X. A man that would be sure of a <span class="hi2">Name</span> in <span class="hi2">Gods Book,</span> must have a care of a <span class="hi2">Name</span> in the <span class="hi2">Devils Book.</span> The Devil in an <span class="hi2">Apish</span> Affectation to Resemble our God, has a <span class="hi2">Book,</span> wherein he Writes the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of all that carry on his Interests, in the World. Not only those more Execrable <span class="hi2">Witches,</span> who Make and Sign Explicit Leagues with <span class="hi2">Evil Spirits,</span> are thus <span class="hi2">Written down for Condemnation,</span> but the Long and Red <span class="hi2">Book</span> of the Devil, has also in it, the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of them who do any notable thing to promote his Design; yea, the <span class="hi2">Names</span> of all that are in any <span class="hi2">Confederacies</span> with him, or are <span class="hi2">Le<span class="gap1">•</span> Captive hy him at his Will.</span> I say then, Call your selves to a <span class="pb">134</span> strict Account, <span class="hi2">Am I one of those that walk after the Prince of the Power of the Air?</span> O<span class="gap1">•</span>, <span class="hi2">Am I one of those who Resist the Devil, when the Devil does Assault them?</span> We must be <span class="hi2">Turned from Satan,</span> before we shall be, <span class="hi2">Rased out of Satans Book.</span> But this is not all; we should also call our selves to a strict Reckoning, <span class="hi2">Am</span> I <span class="hi2">Embark'd in some Affair which the Powers of Darkness will make some Earning of</span>? Or, <span class="hi2">Do I keep clear of every thing that would contribute unto the Devils Kingdom: will
                  the Devil get nothing by what I do</span>? To do so much as any great Job of <span class="hi2">Journec-work</span> for <span class="hi2">Satan,</span> will get us into his <span class="hi2">Book</span>; and how shall we then see that we are in the Lords?

It is possible, that an abusive and a slanderous World, may throw many of your <span class="hi2">Names,</span> into the <span class="hi2">Dirt</span>; But, its no matter; as long as your <span class="hi2">Names</span> are now written in <span class="hi2">Heaven,</span> 'tis well enough?

Let me then break off, as I began; my Text, makes that Loud Cry, <span class="hi2">Fire, Fire!</span> in the Ears of them that have not a <span class="hi2">Name,</span> in the <span class="hi2">Book</span> of God. Know it then, and be Assured of this; Till you have some Assurance of a <span class="hi2">Name written in the Book of Life,</span> you have <span class="hi2">No Assurance of your Life.</span> You have, <span class="hi2">No Assurance,</span> that you shall not Go down into that <span class="hi2">Lake of Fire,</span> where the <span class="hi2">Smoke of the Torment Ascends for ever and ever.</span> You have <span class="hi2">No Assurance,</span> that you shall not be shortly Doom'd unto, <span class="hi2">Everlasting Fire with the Devil and his Angels.</span> You have <span class="hi2">No Assurance</span> that you shall not be Weltering under the Scalding Wrath of God, like the <span class="hi2">Fire</span> of Lightning, preying upon you, in the Fiery Bottom of <span class="hi2">Hell,</span> till the very <span class="hi2">Heavens</span> be no more. Forlorn Souls, you know not but you are to Roar among the doleful Citizens
                  of <span class="hi2">Sodom</span> and <span class="hi2">Gomorrah</span> for Ever. O Retire, and ponder with your <span class="pb">138</span> selves, <span class="hi2">VVhat is like to be my Eternal Portion</span>: and Let the Dread of that <span class="hi2">Fire,</span> which all that are not found in the <span class="hi2">Book of Life</span> shall be Cast into, cause you to be in Restless Agonies of Soul, till you have Attained
                  some Assurance of a <span class="hi2">Name</span> in that <span class="hi2">Book.</span> I Entreat you to be, <span class="hi2">Perswaded knowing the Terror of the Lord</span>; Or, At least, let the ETERNITY of the <span class="hi2">Fire,</span> cause in you a due <span class="hi2">Terrour</span> of it. A person once having spent some time in <span class="hi2">Unlawful Games,</span> could not sleep the Night following; and gave this answer to one that asked the Reason
                  of it, <span class="hi2">Why, Yesterday occasionally casting my eye upon a Book, I saw that word ETERNITY in
                     it; and O that word has broke my Heart within me.</span> Reader, thine <span class="hi2">Eye</span> is now upon a BOOK, wherein thou seest the Word ETERNITY; O let the thoughts of the ETERNITY to which the <span class="hi2">Fire</span> of the Damned shall continue, <span class="hi2">Enkindle</span> thy <span class="hi2">Zeal</span> to make sure of a <span class="hi2">Name</span> written in another BOOK; even, in the <span class="hi2">Book of Life.</span></p>

            </p>
            <p class="p">These words are among the last words of <span class="hi2">Stephen,</span> the <span class="hi2">Martyr of our Lord.</span> The first Martyr of the New Testament, had the Name of <span class="hi2">Stephen,</span> which signifies a <span class="hi2">Crown,</span> &amp; Specif<span class="gap1">•</span>es the <span class="hi2">Event</span> and <span class="hi2">Reward</span> of our Sufferings for God. This Blessed Martyr being accused unto the Council at <span class="hi2">Jerusalem,</span> as a Contemner, yea, as a Blasphemer of their <span class="hi2">Temple Worship,</span> he appeared before them with a <span class="hi2">Face</span> full of Majesty, and an <span class="hi2">Heart</span> full of Magnanimity, and in a grave Speech answered the Accusations. The chief drift
               of his Oration was, That the Worship of God, was performed <span class="hi2">before,</span> and might be truly performed <span class="hi2">without,</span> the Temple at <span class="hi2">Jerusalem</span>; But he intermingles close hints that the Lord Jesus whom they had newly Murdered,
               was the <span class="hi2">Saviour</span> sent by the Almighty to them. As the famous <span class="hi2">Deacon</span> was thus going on, they, <span class="hi2">it seems,</span> interrupted him; upon which he turns his Discourse into the sharp Reprehension; part of which we have now to insist upon. Our Text first, <span class="hi2">Asserts</span> the Impenitency of the Jews; and, secondly, <span class="hi2">Assigns</span> both an Instance and a Reason of that Impenitency. This is in that Remarkable <span class="pb">141</span> Clause, <span class="hi2">Ye do always Resist the Holy Ghost.</span> So that we may observe,
            </p>
            <p class="p">DOCTRINE Mens Resisting of the Holy Ghost, is that which unhappily confirms them in

               <h2 class="head">Proposition I.</h2>
               <p class="p">'Tis Peculiarly and Remarkably the Work of the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit,</span> whereby Sinners are <span class="hi2">Converted</span> unto God. There are <span class="hi2">Three Persons</span> in the Adorable God head; Three Relative Properties, which we fitly call, the <span class="hi2">Father,</span> the <span class="hi2">Son,</span> and <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit.</span> We cannot indeed <span class="hi2">Fathom</span> it, but yet we must <span class="hi2">Receive</span> it, that there are those <span class="hi2">Three Subsistences</span> in the Divine <span class="hi2">Essence</span>; and indeed even the very <span class="hi2">first Line</span> of the Bible pointeth at it. This is a Thing, which not the Light of <span class="hi2">Nature,</span> but the Light of <span class="hi2">Scripture,</span> has Reveal'd unto us. If any ask, How we come to know this <span class="hi2">Trinity</span> in God? I will answer, as <span class="hi2">Athanasius</span> of old; <span class="hi2">Go to Jordan, and thou shalt see a Trinity.</span> In Mat. 3.16, 17. On the Banks of <span class="hi2">Jordan,</span> <span class="pb">142</span> there at once discovered themselves. The <span class="hi2">Father,</span> the <span class="hi2">Son,</span> and the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit.</span> Tho' indeed a <span class="hi2">Trinity</span> of persons in the Godhead, might from the Old Testament also be Evinced, unto the fullest confutation of
                  the Blind <span class="hi2">Jews,</span> who now deny the <span class="hi2">Mystery.</span> Now, there is the Glorious Co-operation of all these <span class="hi2">Three Persons</span> in every Act of God, of which the Creature is the <span class="hi2">Object</span>; yet there is a <span class="hi2">distinct manner</span> of working to be ascribed unto each of them. Thus in the <span class="hi2">Salvation</span> of a Sinner, the Work of <span class="hi2">Contriving</span> that Salvation, belongs to God the <span class="hi2">Father</span>; the Work of <span class="hi2">Effecting</span> it, belongs to God the <span class="hi2">Son</span>; But the Work of <span class="hi2">Applying</span> it, belongs to God the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit.</span> And thence the <span class="hi2">Conversion</span> of Sinners is that in which the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> has a special Interest. When men are <span class="hi2">Converted</span> unto God, how is it wrought? We are told, Tit. 3.5. 'Tis by the <span class="hi2">Renewing of the Holy Ghost.</span> The <span class="hi2">Regeneration</span> of Men, What cause has it? We find in <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 3.5. They that are <span class="hi2">Born again</span> are <span class="hi2">Born of the Spirit.</span> The <span class="hi2">Sanctification</span> of men, what is the Rise of it? It was said of them in 1 Cor. 6.11. <span class="hi2">Ye are Sanctified by the Spirit of our God.</span> It is the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God that reduces men from their <span class="hi2">Slaveries</span> to the Enemies of their Souls; It is the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God, that produces a <span class="gap1">•</span>lessed <span class="hi2">Agreement</span> betwixt God and men; It is the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> <span class="pb">143</span> of God, which <span class="hi2">Turns the Disobedient unto the Wisdom of the Just</span>; which causes the <span class="hi2">Wicked Man to forsake his Way, and the Unrighteous man his Thoughts, and to Turn unto the Lord.</span> If any man ever come to Know, to Love, to Serve the Blessed God, it is the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of that God, who causes them to do so.

            <div class="div">
               <h2 class="head">Proposition II.</h2>
               <p class="p">There are many <span class="hi2">Methods</span> by which the <span class="hi2">Conversion</span> of Sinners is pursued by the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> of God. We read in Gen. 6.3. about the <span class="hi2">Strivings of the Spirit,</span> There are multiplyed <span class="hi2">Strivings</span> or <span class="hi2">Labours,</span> with which the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God is at work about the Souls of men. These <span class="hi2">Methods</span> are with some <span class="hi2">Effectual,</span> and the Souls of men are thereby brought home to God. The <span class="hi2">Methods</span> are with some <span class="hi2">Ineffectual,</span> yet such as to leave the vile men inexcus<span class="gap1">•</span>ble before the Lord. But we should enquire what these <span class="hi2">Methods</span> are?
               </p>
               <p class="p">First, There are <span class="hi2">External Endeavours</span> used by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of men. As now; in the <span class="hi2">Ordinances</span> of God, there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Spiritual Good. The Spirit
                  breaths and mov<span class="gap1">•</span>s in the Appointments of the Gospel. As it was said in Neh. 9.3. <span class="hi2">Thou testifiedst against <span class="pb">144</span> them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets</span>; The <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God sends <span class="hi2">Prophets,</span> Ministers, Messengers, with which he takes pains about the Conversion of ungodly men. The Prophet <span class="hi2">Isaias</span> could say, in Isa: 48.16. <span class="hi2">The Lord God,</span> and His Spirit <span class="hi2">hath sent me</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> Why, when the Embassadors of God, <span class="hi2">are beeseeching of men to be Reconciled unto him,</span> the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of <span class="hi2">the Lord God</span> himself, accompanys them, in their Embassages and in those Beseechings. Again by the <span class="hi2">Providences</span> of God there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Eternal Good. The <span class="hi2">Mercies</span> of God, those are the things with which the Holy Spirit is <span class="hi2">drawing</span> us to Christ; it is in them, that the Spirit of God may say, as in <span class="hi2">Jer.</span> 31.3. <span class="hi2">With Loving Kindness have I drawn thee.</span> The Language of the Spirit in every mercy is, <span class="hi2">O Fear the Lord and His Goodness!</span> and, <span class="hi2">O let the Goodness of God Lead thee to Repentance!</span> The <span class="hi2">Judgments</span> of God, these are the Things, with which the <span class="hi2">Holy</span> Spirit is <span class="hi2">driving</span> us from Sin; for Them we may acknowledge to the Spirit of God, as in <span class="hi2">Job</span> 10.2. <span class="hi2">Thou contendest with me.</span> As the <span class="hi2">Rod</span> has a <span class="hi2">voice,</span> thus there is in every Judgment that voice of the Spirit, <span class="hi2">O Learn Righteousness</span>! and, <span class="hi2">O see what an Evil and a Bitter Thing it is to Forsake thy God</span>! In the Hand of the Spirit, <span class="hi2">Mercies</span> do oblige, <span class="hi2">Judgments</span> do demand our Conversion to the Lord.
               </p>
               <p class="p"><span class="pb">145</span>Secondly, There are <span class="hi2">Internal Endeavours</span> used also by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of Men. And these are of two sorts.
               </p>
               <p class="p">First, the Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by <span class="hi2">Informing</span> of them. He Enlightens them, and by their <span class="hi2">Illumination,</span> they are made <span class="hi2">Partakers of the Holy Ghost.</span> We are told, 1 Cor. 12.3. <span class="hi2">No man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</span> The Holy Spirit perswades many a man, That the Lord Jesus is the <span class="hi2">Wonderful Med<span class="gap1">•</span>ator,</span> without whom, <span class="hi2">There is no Name given, whereby we may be Saved</span>; The <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> Enables many a man to <span class="hi2">Understand</span> and <span class="hi2">Entertain</span> the Fundamental Articles of Religion, and thereby He makes their Conversion appear to be, as it is indeed, an Important Thing before them. 'Tis said of the Holy Spirit, <span class="hi2">Joh.</span> 16.18. <span class="hi2">He shall convince the World.</span> He convinces them, that they have grievously <span class="hi2">sinned,</span> and plunged themselves into innumerable <span class="hi2">Wants</span> and <span class="hi2">Woes,</span> by doing so; He convinces them, that a precious <span class="hi2">Christ,</span> embraced by a penitent <span class="hi2">Faith,</span> is the <span class="hi2">One Thing Needful</span>; How often does He Convince men, That there is a God, in whose <span class="hi2">Favour is Life,</span>; that there is a <span class="hi2">Jesus,</span> who <span class="hi2">delivers from the Wrath to come</span>; that they must Rely upon the Lord Christ for <span class="hi2">Wisdom</span> and <span class="hi2">Righteousness,</span> and <span class="pb">146</span> <span class="hi2">Sanctification</span> and <span class="hi2">Redemption,</span> if they would be made partakers of true Blessedness? And this is that he may <span class="hi2">Convert the World.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Secondly The Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by <span class="hi2">Affecting of them.</span> And there are three things, which the Spirit of God affects many men into, when He
                  is making <span class="hi2">Essays</span> towards the Converting of them.
               </p>
               <p class="p">First, There are dismal <span class="hi2">Terrours</span> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconverted men. He terrifies them with hideous Visions of their own <span class="hi2">Wretchedness</span> and <span class="hi2">Misery</span>: and aff<span class="gap1">•</span>ightens them with a just Apprehension, that if they continue as they are, <span class="hi2">He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them
                     no favour.</span> We read in Rom. 8.15. about the <span class="hi2">Spirit of bondage unto fear.</span> The Spirit of God makes many a man see himself <span class="hi2">bound</span> over to endure the <span class="hi2">Fearful</span> and Fiery Wrath of God for ever; He enkindles in them a <span class="hi2">Fear,</span> that He is <span class="hi2">angry with them every day,</span> and that He will <span class="hi2">break them sore in the place of Dragons at the Last Day.</span> Thus the Spirit made <span class="hi2">Faelix</span> to <span class="hi2">tremble,</span> in the Fore-bodings of a <span class="hi2">Judgment to come.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, There are serious <span class="hi2">Desires,</span> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconverted men. He inflames warm desires in them after the <span class="hi2">Things of their Peace:</span> and raises <span class="pb">147</span> in them some Longings after <span class="hi2">Spiritual Blessings in heavenly matters in Christ Jesus.</span> 'Tis the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God, that made the Jews cry out, Joh. 6.35. Lord, <span class="hi2">give us evermore the Bread of Life.</span> The Spirit of God makes many a man desirous, O <span class="hi2">that my sin were pardoned</span>! and, <span class="hi2">O that my heart were mollified</span>! and, <span class="hi2">O that my Soul were bound up in the Bun <span class="gap1">•••</span> of Life</span>! Thus the Spirit made <span class="hi2">Balaam</span> wi<span class="gap1">•</span>h, O <span class="hi2">that I might dy the Death of the Righteous.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Thirdly, There are Devout <span class="hi2">Resolves,</span> which the Spirit of God often causes in Unconverted men. He fills them with <span class="hi2">Resolves,</span> to <span class="hi2">break off their sins by Righteousness</span>: and with many purposes and intentions, that they will walk at <span class="hi2">Peradventures</span> with God no more. 'Twas the Spirit of God that procured such an Inclination as that
                  in them of old, Jer. 2.10. <span class="hi2">Thou sayest</span> I <span class="hi2">will not transgress.</span> The Spirit of God puts many upon such Resolutions, <span class="hi2">I have done Iniquity, but I</span> will <span class="hi2">do so no more.</span> The <span class="hi2">Vows</span> men make, when a Dreadful Eternity is before their eyes<span class="g2">▪</span> their Sick-bed Vows, and Sea-storm Vows and the Vows which they make when Distress and Anguish is upon them, these are often excited by the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God. Thus the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God was concerned with <span class="hi2">Is <span class="gap1">••</span>el,</span> when<span class="g2">▪</span> they <span class="hi2">flattered God with their mouth.</span> These are the <span class="hi2">Methods</span> of the Holy <span class="hi2">Spirit,</span> <span class="pb">148</span> while he <span class="hi2">strives</span> for the conversion of lost undone fallen men.

               <h2 class="head"><span class="hi2">Proposition,</span> III.
               </h2>
               <p class="p">Multitudes of wretched sinners <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the <span class="hi2">Methods</span> used by the Holy Spirit for the Conversion of their Souls; and in so doing they <span class="hi2">Resist the Holy Ghost.</span> But how is this done? The Greek word here <span class="hi2">to Resist</span> signifies <span class="hi2">To throw something in the way,</span> to hinder the <span class="hi2">Passage</span> or <span class="hi2">Journey</span> of another. The Spirit of God is in the <span class="hi2">way</span> of Converting many a man, but the mad sinner will throw, something or other in the <span class="hi2">way</span> of the Holy Spirit, so that He makes a stop, a stand, He goes no further in it; This
                  'tis to <span class="hi2">Resist the Holy Ghost.</span> Particularly;
               </p>
               <p class="p">First, Unconverted Sinners, <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the Spirit of God by <span class="hi2">Diversion</span>; when the Spirit of God would be <span class="hi2">Renewing</span> of them, they throw some <span class="hi2">Diversion</span> in his Way. Perhaps this Holy Spirit cannot come at them, because of their <span class="hi2">Business.</span> When the Spirit would have been Recovering of wicked <span class="hi2">Cain</span> from his forlorn estate, we find in Gen. 4.17. He went away to <span class="hi2">building of Cities.</span> Men so get and keep in the clattering noise of the <span class="hi2">world</span> <span class="pb">149</span> they always find something to do, and create a Thousand Hurries for themselves: Hence the Spirit of God never finds them at
                  leisure enough, to do any thing upon them. Or, the Holy Spirit cannot come at them,
                  because of their <span class="hi2">Company.</span> 'Tis said of bad <span class="hi2">Companions,</span> in Prov. 5.9, <span class="hi2">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of Life,</span> their <span class="hi2">ways are moveable.</span> Even so, least the <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of God should make men begin <span class="gap1">•</span>o <span class="hi2">Ponder,</span> and <span class="hi2">Practise</span> too, as they ought to do, the <span class="hi2">moveable</span> and <span class="hi2">mutable</span> Humours of their Society prove a fatal entangl<span class="gap1">•</span>ment unto them; they hear so much and so loud their <span class="hi2">Boon Companions,</span> that the Spirit of God can have no Admission to speak unto them.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, Unconverted men <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the Spirit of God by <span class="hi2">Denial.</span> When the Spirit of God would be <span class="hi2">Renewing</span> of them, they do throw a <span class="hi2">Positive Denial</span> in his way, and so they send him away sorrowful. Their Impiety, is that in Job 21:14: <span class="hi2">They say to God depart from us, for we desire not the knowledg of thy ways.</span> They say unto the Spirit of God <span class="hi2">Be gone, we desire not the happiness, which thou dost offer to us</span>! They say unto him, <span class="hi2">Be gone, we desire not the Holiness, which thou dost a<span class="gap1">••</span>vize us to.</span> It was a lamentable entercourse betwixt God and them, in Jer: 44.16: <span class="hi2">As for the <span class="pb">150</span> word thou hast spoken to us, we</span> will <span class="hi2">not hearken to thee.</span> Thus the Spirit of God saies, <span class="hi2">Pray in thy Family, Pray in thy Retirement</span>: but lewd men say, <span class="hi2">No, we</span> will <span class="hi2">not</span>! The Spirt of God saies, <span class="hi2">Bind thy self by an Holy Covenant vnto the service of the Lord</span>; but wild men say, <span class="hi2">No, we</span> will <span class="hi2">not</span>! The Spirit of God entreats, <span class="hi2">O do not the Abominable things which</span> I <span class="hi2">hate!</span> But there are extravagant men that say, <span class="hi2">We will do them every day!</span> The Spirit of God now goes away grieved at this Cursed Obstinacy.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Thirdly, Unconverted men <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the Spirit of God by affronting, and abusing those in whom it is. Compare our Text
                  with what follows, and you find things thus expressed. Mens <span class="hi2">Resisting of the Holy Ghost,</span> is explained by their <span class="hi2">Persecuting</span> of the <span class="hi2">Prophets</span>: truly, to <span class="hi2">Persecute</span> the Ministers of the Gospel, who are <span class="hi2">Ministers of the Spirit</span>; this is to <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the Spirit Himself. To scoff, or starve, or slay those men, whom the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> hath made His <span class="hi2">Trumpets</span> or His <span class="hi2">Temples,</span> 'tis to <span class="hi2">Resist</span> Him: So likewise to despise or oppose and suppress the Means of Grace, in which are
                  the <span class="hi2">Demonstration<span class="gap1">•</span></span> of the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit,</span> this is to <span class="hi2">Resist</span> Him. Tis to throw <span class="hi2">Malignity</span> in His way.

               </h2>
               <p class="p">This <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of the Holy Spirit, is that which confirms men in their impenitent unbelief. And this
                  there is too doleful <span class="hi2">Reason</span> for.
               </p>
               <p class="p">The Reason of it is, in short thus much; The <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of the Holy Spirit proves the <span class="hi2">withdrawing of that Spirit:</span> He saies in Gen: 6:3. <span class="hi2">My Spirit shall not always strive</span>; And if the Spirit shall cease to <span class="hi2">strive,</span> the Sinner will never begin to <span class="hi2">turn.</span> The Rule, the Old Rule, about the <span class="hi2">Evil Spirit,</span> is too sadly verified in the motions of the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit,</span> if you <span class="hi2">Resist him he will Flee from you.</span> The <span class="hi2">Dove</span> will not care to tarr<span class="gap1">•</span>, where no good entertainment is ever like to be afforded Him. Indeed the <span class="hi2">Power</span> of the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit,</span> gives no bar to his converting of them, who may be <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of Him; He <span class="hi2">can</span> if he <span class="hi2">will</span> proceed and conquer the most obdurate <span class="hi2">Resistance</span> in the World; He can cause the most obdurate <span class="hi2">Resistance</span> to give way before Almighty Arm. But it is the <span class="hi2">Justice</span> of the Holy Spirit that Countenances this order of things; when Men <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the Spirit of God it is but <span class="hi2">just</span> with him to <span class="hi2">desert</span> them. It is but <span class="hi2">just</span> if men <span class="hi2">resist</span> him, that he should resolve concerning them, I <span class="hi2">will ease me of those <span class="pb">152</span> my Enemies, and avenge me of those my Adversaries</span>! It was their woful experience long ago, in Isa: 63:10. <span class="hi2">They rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit, therefore He was turned to be their Enemy.</span> The Holy Spirit becomes a terri<span class="gap1">•</span>le <span class="hi2">Enemy</span> to them that will always <span class="hi2">resist</span> him; and alas, now their Conversion is to be despaired of. Without the Efficacy of
                  the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit,</span> no Conversion is to be hoped for; but when He is long <span class="hi2">Resisted,</span> he withholds that Efficacy, and instead of <span class="hi2">Conversion</span> there now ensues a nothing but a deplorable and Everlasting <span class="hi2">Confusion</span> in the Soul.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Particularly,</p>
               <p class="p">First, The <span class="hi2">External</span> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will cease upon our long <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of Him. To <span class="hi2">Resist</span> Him, will soon bring us to this, That His <span class="hi2">Word</span> will no more sound in our ears, and we shall know no more the <span class="hi2">joyful sound.</span> <span class="gap1">〈◊〉</span> was a most Awful threatning in Amos: 8.11. I <span class="hi2">will send a Famine of hearing the Word of the Lord.</span> Persons, that sat once under a Powerful Ministry, some<span class="gap1">•</span>imes for this, come to be where the <span class="hi2">Cloud<span class="gap1">•</span> will rain no more upon them</span>; where there is no <span class="hi2">H<span class="gap1">•</span>use</span> of God, no <span class="hi2">Fear</span> of God, no <span class="hi2">Bread</span> of <span class="gap1">•</span>ife. Whole Churches <span class="hi2">&amp;</span> Na<span class="gap1">•</span>ions of men that once enjoyed the word of Life, a<span class="gap1">•</span>e for this now perishing without any <span class="hi2">Vision.</span> And it will soon bring us to <span class="pb">153</span> this also, that his Providence will no more be concerned for us. Many a man, once
                  had the <span class="hi2">Light of God shining upon his Tabernacle,</span> but now every thing brings a Cross with it, and he may say, <span class="hi2">All things are against me.</span> 'Tis because the Spirit of God speaking to him in his <span class="hi2">Prosperity</span> hath been <span class="hi2">resisted</span>; even for that cause now it is with him as in Ez: 7.26. <span class="hi2">Mischief shall come upon Mischief.</span> On the other side, many a man had <span class="hi2">his way so hedged up with thorns,</span> that he could not sin so easily, as else he would have done; but how God has done
                  afflicting and restraining of him. Why? He <span class="hi2">Resisted</span> the Spirit of God speaking to him in his <span class="hi2">Adversity</span>; and now the Lord saies as in Hos. 7.14: <span class="hi2">He is joined to</span> Idols, <span class="hi2">Let him alone</span>: One of the Ancients upon that Scripture says, <span class="hi2">Vis Indignantis Dei terribilem vocem audire?</span> Tis the terriblest Thunder of a Provoked and Revenging God!
               </p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, The <span class="hi2">Internal</span> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will also cease upon our long <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of Him. It was said of <span class="hi2">Saul,</span> wretched <span class="hi2">Saul,</span> in 1 Sam. 16.14. <span class="hi2">The Spirit of the Lord, departed from him.</span> It was again s<span class="gap1">•</span>id to <span class="hi2">Saul,</span> bloody<span class="g2">▪</span> <span class="hi2">Saul,</span> in 1 Sam. 28.16. <span class="hi2">The Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine Enemie.</span> This was after and because that wretched bloody man, had been long <span class="hi2">Fighting</span> against that <span class="pb">154</span> Blessed <span class="hi2">Spirit of the Lord.</span> A long <span class="hi2">Resistance</span> of the Holy Spirit will bring a man to this woful plight, <span class="hi2">The Spirit of the Lord</span> will <span class="gap1">••••</span>ly forsake that forlorn man; <span class="hi2">The Spirit of the Lord</span> will take no loving, no saving, no converting Notice of him.
               </p>
               <p class="p">Yet more particularly,</p>
               <p class="p">First, A <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <span class="hi2">Penal Blindness</span> of Mind. It was the heavy vengeance of God, upon some in <span class="hi2">Isa.</span> 44.18. <span class="hi2">He hath shut their eyes, they cannot see.</span> The Spirit of God may so leave us, upon <span class="hi2">Resistance,</span> that no <span class="hi2">Heresy,</span> no <span class="hi2">Blasphemy</span> shall come amiss unto us, but we shall swallow down very damnable <span class="hi2">Delusions</span> as the <span class="hi2">Oracles</span> of God. Perhaps all the Monsters of <span class="hi2">Quakerism</span> or of <span class="hi2">Popery,</span> or any other Disguised <span class="hi2">Paganism,</span> shall Recommend themselves unto us, as the most beautiful <span class="hi2">Mysteries of Godliness.</span></p>
               <p class="p">Secondly, A <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <span class="hi2">Paenal Hardness</span> of Heart. As it was of old said in Exod. 10.27. <span class="hi2">The Lord hardened the Heart of Pharoah</span>; Upon <span class="hi2">Resistance</span> the Spirit of God will so leave us, that nothing shall <span class="hi2">melt us,</span> nothing shall <span class="hi2">fright</span> us, no calls, no crys, no counsels will cause us to turn from our <span class="hi2">Evil Ways</span>; our hearts will be like the <span class="hi2">Nether <span class="pb">155</span> Milstone</span> before the Lord; we shall now lay nothing to Heart, and there will be a <span class="hi2">seared Conscience</span> in us: a Conscience that shall seldome, if ever sting us, for our sinful Omissions, or Commissions, or for any of our <span class="hi2">Doings against the Lord.</span> Once more,
               </p>
               <p class="p">Thirdly, A <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> of the Holy Spirit, will so exasperate Him, That He will give us up to commit all
                  manner of abominations without <span class="hi2">Remorse.</span> 'Twas said of some Rom. 1.26. <span class="hi2">God gave them up to vile affections.</span> Such an Horrendous Desolation, comes at last upon the Souls, that have long stood
                  it out, against all the exhortations of the Eternal Spirit. That Spirit of God will
                  so abandon us, that we shall be <span class="hi2">Devils</span> Incarnate, and yet never <span class="hi2">tremble</span> as the Spiritual <span class="hi2">Devils</span> do; we shall come to swear Profanely, and violate Sabbaths, &amp; Curse, &amp; be Drunkards, and Wantons, and Cheat, and
                  Ly, and be all that is <span class="hi2">Earthly, Sensual, Divelish,</span> without any Horrour of Soul upon it; We shall make light of the most Roaring Iniquities, and being <span class="hi2">past feeling, work out all uncleaness with greediness</span>; this tis for men to be confirmed in their impenitent unbelief. But something must
                  now be said for the Improvement of these things, and let it be in this
               </p>

            <div class="div"><span class="pb">156</span><h2 class="head">CAUTION.</h2>
               <p class="p">Leave off then, <span class="hi2">Ye Unconverted sinners,</span> leave off <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> the Holy Spirit of God! O how many <span class="hi2">Unreasonable</span> (for I may call them <span class="hi2">Unreasonable) Souls</span> are there before the Lord this day, of whom it may be said, <span class="hi2">This hath been their manner from their Youth up</span>? 'Tis indeed, the case, the crime of all you, that never yet were <span class="hi2">Converted</span> unto God. I believe there is hardly a Child of Twelve Years Old among us, which the
                  Spirit of God has not been in some sort working upon; but in the Name of God, what is come of it? Are you not still in the <span class="hi2">Gall of Bitterness, and in the Bond of Iniquity</span>? Are you not still <span class="hi2">Prayerless,</span> Graceless, Christless? Is not the day yet to dawn, the hour yet to come, of your closing
                  with the Lord Jesus upon <span class="hi2">Gospel terms</span>? Alas, you have, then, all this while been <span class="hi2">Resisting</span> the Holy Spirit of God. <span class="gap1">•</span>ut have done, <span class="hi2">you unwary Souls,</span> have done, <span class="gap1">•</span>ay down your <span class="hi2">Arms</span>; let not the <span class="hi2">Best Friend</span> you have in the world be any more treated <span class="gap1">•</span>o. The Lord could say as in Jerem: 2.5. <span class="hi2">What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me.</span> Thus does the Holy Spirit of God plead with you, <span class="hi2">What Injury have I done thee, <span class="pb">157</span> poor Soul? What harm do</span> I <span class="hi2">perswade thee to, that thou wilt not allow me to perfect a work of Conversion in thee?</span></p>
               <p class="p">But, this matter should have a little more pressing discourse; Wherefore.</p>
               <div class="div">
                  <h3 class="head">Consider, FIRST.</h3>
                  <p class="p">The <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> of God is, at this very day, using his <span class="hi2">Methods</span> for the converting of your Souls. As the Apostle speaking of what <span class="hi2">The Holy Ghost saith,</span> he puts that Remark upon it, <span class="hi2">He saies, to Day, after so long a Time, harden not your hearts.</span> This may I say, Behold <span class="hi2">after so long a time,</span> after all the <span class="hi2">Resistance,</span> after all the <span class="hi2">Injustice</span> you have given to the Holy Ghost, He still begs of you, <span class="hi2">O that you would be Converted unto God</span>! The crys of the Holy Spirit in your ears are those in Ruth 1.16. <span class="hi2">Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee.</span> Have you not <span class="hi2">Outward Offers</span> of the Gospel made unto you? at this very instant you have them. We read in Rev. 22.15. <span class="hi2">The Spirit saith come, and whosoever will let him come, and take of the Waters of
                        Life freely.</span> 'Tis the <span class="hi2">Holy Spirit</span> of God that is now urging of you, <span class="hi2">To turn and live.</span> You are now called upon, <span class="hi2">O come and give yourselves to the Son of God</span>! You are now called upon, <span class="hi2">O come and <span class="pb">158</span> join yourselves to the Church of God!</span> It is the Holy Spirit of God that is bespeaking these needful and useful things at your hands. Have you not also <span class="hi2">Inward Moving<span class="gap1">•</span></span> in your own souls to accept hereof? You cannot well be without them. It is said in <span class="hi2">Isa.</span> 30.21. <span class="hi2">Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, this is the way walk ye in it.</span> Thus you have a word <span class="hi2">within</span> you, saying, <span class="hi2">O depart from the Tents of wicked men, lest you perish in all their sins</span>! You have a word <span class="hi2">within</span> you, saying, <span class="hi2">O let not matters between your God, and your Soul, any more lye at uncertainties</span>! 'Tis the Holy Spirit of God that is in this <span class="hi2">Word within you.</span> These <span class="hi2">Urgencies</span> are from that Holy Spirit. Let no discouraged person countenance any Despair in themselves
                     about this Affair; Let no disconsolate person say, <span class="hi2">The Spirit has wholly done with me.</span> Is this a thing that thou art <span class="hi2">afraid</span> &amp; <span class="hi2">concerned</span> about? There's a sign, thou art not so unhappy yet: the Holy Spirit of God is yet
                     at work about thy Soul, &amp; as it is said in <span class="hi2">Heb.</span> 3.7 <span class="hi2">The Holy Spirit saith, to day, O that you would hear the Voice of God</span>! Yet

               <div class="div">
                  <h3 class="head">Consider SECONDLY.</h3>
                  <p class="p">Tis possible, there are some of <span class="hi2">You,</span> that have sad cause to fear that the Spirit of God will quickly have done with you, if you <span class="hi2">Resist</span> him any more. Some of <span class="hi2">you,</span> even some of <span class="hi2">you</span> that are now before the Lord, may have so <span class="hi2">Resisted</span> the <span class="pb">159</span> Holy Spirit of God, that you may fear, a little <span class="hi2">Resistence</span> more may cause the Eternal Departure of his influences from your Souls. Methinks I overhear the Holy Spirit of God
                     saying to some of us, <span class="hi2">Be instructed, poor soul, be instructed quickly, lest I depart from thee, and thou
                        become desolate for evermore.</span> There are Souls whose <span class="hi2">Time</span> is almost our, whose <span class="hi2">Glass</span> is almost Run; the <span class="hi2">Inch of Candle</span> is come just to the bottom with them; If they dont, presently, make a Good <span class="hi2">Bargain</span> for Eternal Happiness, they must necessarily perish in the <span class="hi2">dark.</span> But, who are they? Let me speak plainly, &amp; as it becomes a <span class="hi2">Watchman</span> of your Precious and Immortal <span class="hi2">Souls,</span> for which I would awfully suppose my self accountable.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">First, You that have bin long <span class="hi2">Incorrigible</span> under the Dispensations of the Holy Spirit, have cause to fear, that his <span class="hi2">Methods</span> for your Conversion are very near an end. The Holy Spirit of God has been <span class="hi2">Besieging</span> and <span class="hi2">Bel<span class="gap1">•</span>aguring</span> of your Souls; but have you long refused to yield unto Him? You have then cause to fear that he will quickly <span class="hi2">break up</span> and <span class="hi2">be gone</span>; That He will quickly say as in Isa. 1.5. <span class="hi2">Why should you be stricken any more</span>? The Holy Spirit is the Physician of your Souls; perhaps He will try one or two <span class="hi2">Remedies</span> more, for the Cure of your <span class="hi2">Distempers</span>; but if they succeed not, tis probable he will then quickly Resolve, <span class="hi2">I will do no more for them, they will be filthy &amp; they shall be filthy, they will be wicked, and they shall be wicked; I <span class="pb">160</span> will never have mercy on them.</span> Especially let those that are grown <span class="hi2">Old</span> in their sins, tremble and be amazed, and astonished at the thought of this; You that
                     have <span class="hi2">Gray Hairs</span> upon you, while you are yet un<span class="gap1">••</span>quainted with the ways of God; If you shall <span class="hi2">Resist</span> the Holy Spirit any more, He will soon give that terrible Order in Luke 13.9. <span class="hi2">Cut him down</span>; let there be no more <span class="hi2">digging</span> about that Irrecoverable Soul for ever.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p">Secondly, You that have sinned <span class="hi2">against,</span> until you have sinned <span class="hi2">away,</span> great <span class="hi2">Convictions</span> of the Holy Spirit, have cause to fear that shortly you shall not have them any more.
                     Ye Souls in Danger, Hear what I say; you that have had your <span class="hi2">Consciences</span> awakened by the words or works of God; you that by the Thunders of God, have been
                     awakened into some <span class="hi2">purposes to transgress no more</span>; if you have sti<span class="gap1">••</span>ed those <span class="hi2">Convictions,</span> there is danger of your being speecily given over by the <span class="hi2">Holy one of Israel.</span> The Lord said o<span class="gap1">•</span> old in Psal. 81.11.12. <span class="hi2">My people would not hearken to my voice,; so I gave them up.</span> In<span class="gap1">••</span>ead of <span class="hi2">hearkning</span> to the voice of the Holy Spirit, many a <span class="hi2">Drunken,</span> many an <span class="hi2">Uncl<span class="gap1">••</span>n,</span> many a <span class="hi2">Gaming</span> Extravagant, will go, and commit the same sin again; at first they were in some trouble
                     for it, but now, they can repeat their Villany without any <span class="hi2">Regret at</span> all; Is this thy condition, unreclaimable sinner? Is this the condition of thy lamentable
                     and <span class="pb">161</span> incurable Soul! Thou art then under a direful symptom, that one <span class="hi2">Resistance</span> of the Holy Spi<span class="gap1">•</span>it more may bring thy Soul down to the <span class="hi2">Congregation of the Dead.</span></p>
                  <p class="p">Thirdly, You that have Backslidden from some hopeful <span class="hi2">Professions</span> and <span class="hi2">Practices</span> of Christianity, have yet further cause to fear this <span class="hi2">Fearful thing,</span> that you shall be no longer in the healing <span class="hi2">Hands</span> of the Spirit of the <span class="hi2">Living God.</span> It was <span class="gap1">•</span>aid in the 2 <span class="hi2">Chron.</span> 15.2. <span class="hi2">If you forsake the Lord, he will forsake you.</span> The <span class="hi2">Spirit</span> of the Lord will soon be gone, Remove, Wi<span class="gap1">••</span>draw, from those who do <span class="hi2">forsake</span> Him. Hear this, all you <span class="hi2">Apostates</span> from Religion! You that once had in you <span class="hi2">some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel</span>; What is become of it? What is become of the Devotion, which once carried you to
                     your <span class="hi2">Closets,</span> and to the <span class="hi2">Private</span> and <span class="hi2">Publick</span> Meetings of the upright? Have you <span class="hi2">Left off the thing that is good?</span> 'Tis a sign that the Holy Spirit of God has almost <span class="hi2">Left off</span> all endeavours for <span class="hi2">your Good.</span> But
                  </p>

               <div class="div">
                  <h3 class="head">Consider THIRDLY.</h3>
                  <p class="p">If once the <span class="hi2">Resisted</span> Spirit of God have <span class="hi2">done</span> with you, you are then horribly <span class="hi2">undone</span> for ever! There will then be no <span class="hi2">Conversion</span> to be expected for you, nor will any <span class="hi2">Salvation</span> be then attainable; Then you perish without any <span class="hi2">Remedy or Escaping</span>! Then you <span class="pb">162</span> have nothing but a <span class="hi2">Fearful Expectation</span> of a <span class="hi2">Fiery Indignation</span> to devour you. O Remember, the <span class="hi2">Day of Grace</span> will then be over with you, as it was with <span class="hi2">Esau,</span> who in Gen. 27.34. Unsuccessfully <span class="hi2">Cr<span class="gap1">•</span>'d with great and exceeding Bitter Cry, Bless me, O my Father!</span> Then, tho' like the Foolish Virgins you Cry, <span class="hi2">Lord, Lord, open to me</span> Tho' you Cry, <span class="hi2">Lord, Lord, Vouchsafe me one tender of Jesus more</span>! Or, <span class="hi2">Lord, Lord, afford me one Season of Mercy more</span>! It will be all in vain. I must now seasonably tell you, it will be as the Outcry of some has been, <span class="hi2">All to Late! All to Late!</span> Forsaken Souls, your Plight will then be that of <span class="hi2">Israel,</span> in Deut. 1.45. <span class="hi2">Who Return'd and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not hearken to their voice.</span> Tho' you should then beg with tears of Blood, <span class="hi2">Lord, extend thy pity to a wretched Soul</span> <span class="g2">▪</span> it will signify nothing at all. I do assure you, this <span class="hi2">Resisted</span> Spirit of God, will at last apply Himself unto the Spirits of Impenitents, no otherwise
                     than as an Ireful and a Dreadful Tormentor, world without end.

                  <p class="p">An earnest <span class="hi2">Petition</span> for the Spirit. It is a sweet Promise in Luke 11.13. <span class="hi2">Your Heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit unto them, that ask him.</span> O then <span class="hi2">Ask</span>: especially let the <span class="hi2">Rising Generation</span> Ask for this Blessing. You may plead your <span class="hi2">Descent</span>; for the Voice of the Lord is in Isa. 44.3. <span class="hi2">I will pour my Spirit upon the seed of my servants.</span> Go alone, then, and Pray, and say, <span class="hi2">Lord, Let me Enjoy thy Holy Spirit, and have the Grace never to Resist him.</span></p>

Let every Soul answer Him, as the Psalmist in Psal. 27:8. <span class="hi2">When thou saidst seek my Face, my Heart answered, Thy face I will seek.</span> So when the Holy Spirit, says, <span class="hi2">Leave sin,</span> or <span class="hi2">Prize Christ,</span> answer now; <span class="hi2">Lord I will do it, if thou wil<span class="gap1">•</span> help me!</span> Resign yourselves up to the Conduct of that <span class="hi2">Good Spirit,</span> that so <span class="pb">164</span> you may be <span class="hi2">Led into the Land of Uprightness</span> Forever.
