         <div class="p">Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl, TEI @ Oxford. </div>
         <div class="p">EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
            publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
            image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
            (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually
            the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473
            and 1700 available in EEBO.
         </div>
         <div class="p">EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
            restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions
            (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based
            on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
         </div>
         <div class="p">The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
            Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015.
            Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully
            request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
         </div>
         <div class="p">Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
            assumptions that can be made about the data.
         </div>
         <div class="p">Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL).
            If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works
            are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of
            subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general,
            first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number
            of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second
            or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
         </div>
         <div class="p">Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding.
            Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan.
            5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy
            and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone.
            After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked
            as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text.
            Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should
            make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will
            remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear
            in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a
            TCP editor.
         </div>
         <div class="p">The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
            TEI in Libraries guidelines.
         </div>
         <div class="p">Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
            mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented
            either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters
            represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                  <div class="hi">The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not dy. This</div> is a

                  <div class="hi">Instead of the Thorn, shall come up the Fir tree, and instead of the Briar, shall
                     come up the Myrtle-tree.
                  </div> We have another shadow of this Change, fetch'd from 
                  <div class="hi">Animate</div> Things; in Isa. 11.6. 
                  <div class="hi">The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid.</div> In

                  <div class="hi">Lamb</div> from a 
                  <div class="hi">Wolf</div>! Thus, One of the Primitive Christians, after his Conver
                  <div class="g"></div>sion, being met by an Idolater of his old Acquaintance, had that Salutation from him, 
                  <div class="hi">Ego Sum,</div> Sir, 'tis 
                  <div class="hi">I</div>? whereupon he Re

                  <div class="hi">'Tis not I</div>; I am not the man I was. We may therefore add,

               <div class="p">Secondly, It is a THOROUGH

                  <div class="hi">Image</div> of God; by defacing the Impressions of Hell that had been made upon us. There is a
                  marvellous 
                  <div class="hi">A
                     <div class="g"></div>greement
                  </div> now between God and Man; wherein though not the 
                  <div class="hi">Essence,</div> nor the 
                  <div class="hi">Greatness</div> of God, yet a Resemblance of His HOLINESS is in a blessed measure Communicated unto
                  the man thus, 
                  <div class="hi">Born again.</div> It may be said of him, 
                  <div class="hi">He is a man after Gods own Heart</div>; he 
                  <div class="hi">Likes,</div> he 
                  <div class="hi">Loves,</div> he 
                  <div class="hi">Lives</div> after such a manner as to de

                  <div class="hi">Holiness,</div> which is Infinite in the 
                  <div class="hi">Holy One of Israel.</div> Hence, a Regenerate man studies a most exact Conformity to the Example of the Lord
                  Jesus Christ, and Attains very much of what he studies. As a Renowned Minister could
                  say, 
                  <div class="hi">When I am to Preach a Sermon,</div> I 
                  <div class="hi">set my self to think, How would Jesus Christ Preach, were He to Handle my Subject</div>! So a Regenerate man sometimes thinks, 
                  <div class="hi">How did the Blessed Jesus do such a Duty?</div> or, 
                  <div class="hi">How did the bles
                     <div class="g"></div>sed 
                     <div class="pb"></div> Jesus bear such a Trial
                  </div>? and then he endeavours to go 
                  <div class="hi">and do Likewise.</div> A Re
                  <div class="g"></div>generate man, is a CHRISTIAN in reality; that is, 
                  <div class="hi">A Christ-like man</div>; and it may be said of such ones, 
                  <div class="hi">As thou art, so are they

                  <div class="hi">Repentance,</div> and the 
                  <div class="hi">Faith,</div> so called for. Such is the REPEN
                  <div class="g"></div>TANCE 
                  <div class="pb"></div> of a Regenerate man; that he looks on his manifold sinfulness both by 
                  <div class="hi">Nature</div> and

                  <div class="hi">Lord,</div> I 
                  <div class="hi">am vile</div>: He then mourns for that exceeding sinfulness, and Loathes himself with the

            </div>
            <div class="p">II. In Coming to our Lord Jesus Christ, we must seek and ask for the 
               <div class="hi">Whole</div> of that 
               <div class="hi">Salvation,</div> which He has to bestow upon us. It is no sinful

               </div> The

               <div class="g"></div>wrap'd so in our

               <div class="hi">What God has thus Joyned, Let no man put asunder!</div> Yea, a man should not forbear Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, altho' he can see nothing,
               but 
               <div class="hi">Self,</div> stirring him thereunto; Let him come, tho' it be at first upon 
               <div class="hi">Meaner Ends; that</div> will be the way for him to obtain an Impression of 
               <div class="hi">Nobler Ends</div> upon him, when he shall come again. However, what is to be, 
               <div class="hi">The End of our Faith</div>? 'tis to be, 
               <div class="hi">The Salvation of the Soul.</div> Why then, Let us be sure therein to pro

               <div class="hi">Salvation.</div> As it was of old said, 
               <div class="hi">Is Christ Divided</div>? so we must make no 
               <div class="hi">Di

               </div> of that 
               <div class="hi">Salvation,</div> for which the Lord Jesus Christ is to be Sued unto. Even the 
               <div class="hi">Murderers</div> of our Lord, were averse unto 
               <div class="pb"></div> 
               <div class="hi">Dividing</div> of his

               <div class="hi">Believers</div> on our Lord are as averse unto the 
               <div class="hi">Dividing</div> of His 
               <div class="hi">Mercies,</div> Well then, Let us ponder with our selves, what a 
               <div class="hi">Priest,</div> what a 
               <div class="hi">Pro

               <div class="hi">Do</div> all that is to be done by such an One for our Souls.
            </div>
            <div class="p">Particularly, 
               <div class="hi">Atonement,</div> is one of those things which we are to come unto the Lord Jesus for. We are to come
               unto Him, as He is represented in Psal. 110.4. 
               <div class="hi">Thou art a Priest for ever!</div> He demands of

               <div class="hi">Art thou willing that I should be a Priest for thy Soul</div>! and we must heartily consent un
               <div class="g"></div>to his being so; therewithal, saying like the Psalmist, in Psal. 119. 122. 
               <div class="hi">O be surety for thy servant for good.</div> We must come unto Him, as unto, 
               <div class="hi">The Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world</div>: Come un

               <div class="hi">Him, That Loves us, and washes us from our sins in His own Blood</div>; Come unto Him, as unto that Jesus who having made 
               <div class="hi">Satisfaction</div> for us on the Cross, here below, goes up, and goes on, to make 
               <div class="hi">Intercession</div> for us, at the Right Hand of God
               <div class="g">▪</div> above. We must ask to enjoy such a JESUS in him! yea, and at the same time, we should
               be willing to pay the Dues of the 
               <div class="hi">High Priest</div> unto him.
            </div>
            <div class="p">Again, 
               <div class="hi">Instruction</div> is another of those things 
               <div class="pb"></div> which we are to come unto the Lord Je

               <div class="hi">A Prophet shall the Lord Raise up unto you.</div> He enquires of us, 
               <div class="hi">Art thou willing that I should be the Prophet of thy Soul</div>! and we must sincere
               <div class="g"></div>ly consent unto His being that; saying with the Psalmist, in Psal. 25.4. 
               <div class="hi">Shew me thy Ways, O Lord; Teach me thy Paths.</div> We must come unto Him, for that 
               <div class="hi">Eye salve</div> whereof He hath said, 
               <div class="hi">I counsel thee to buy it of me</div>! Come unto Him, as of old that

            <div class="p">Once more, Tis for

               <div class="hi">The King upon the Holy hill of Zion.</div> He puts that on us,

               <div class="hi">III.</div> Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is a thing that calleth for the 
               <div class="hi">Whole Soul,</div> and all proper motions of the Soul, to be engaged in it. As in Praising of God, it
               is the Rule, in 
               <div class="hi">Psal.</div> 103.1. 
               <div class="hi">Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me, Praise his Holy Name</div>; so in coming to Christ, the same Rule is to be observed; 
               <div class="hi">It must be done with the whole Soul, and all that is within us.</div> The mind, the will, the Af

            </div>
            <div class="p">First, It is with a certain 
               <div class="hi">Perswasion</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to come unto him. When we come unto the Lord 
               <div class="pb"></div> Jesus Christ, we must Firmly 
               <div class="hi">Believe</div> all the Discoveries and Revelations, which God has given of him; and we should come

               </div> We are to be well perswaded of the Excellent Qualities i

               </div> that 
               <div class="hi">In Him there does all Fulness dwell.</div> There are especially four perswasions which we are to Entertain, about our Lord Jesus
               Christ: or else we shall be 
               <div class="hi">Lame</div> in our Coming unto Him. One is, 
               <div class="hi">That He is Able to Save unto the uttermost, all that Come unto God, by Him.</div> A Second is, 
               <div class="hi">That there is none other Name under Heaven, given a
                  <div class="g"></div>mong men, whereby we must be Saved.
               </div> A Third is, 
               <div class="hi">That whosoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise Cast him out.</div> A Fourth is, 
               <div class="hi">That he who Believeth, shall be Saved.</div> All of these, must be Look'd upon as most 
               <div class="hi">Faithful Sayings</div>; and we must be ready to venture all the Interests of our Immortal Souls upon them.
            </div>
            <div class="p">Secondly, It is with a fervent 
               <div class="hi">Petition</div> to the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to Come unto Him. The posture wherein we should
               come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is upon our 
               <div class="hi">Knees:</div> and we should present 
               <div class="pb"></div> our prayers before him, as did the leper, in 
               <div class="hi">Marc.</div> 1.40. 
               <div class="hi">He came to him, Beseeching Him, and kneeling down to him.</div> Tis in the Qua

               <div class="hi">Petitioners</div>; yea, and of 
               <div class="hi">Poor</div> ones too, that we are to 
               <div class="hi">sue</div> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come unto him. As a

               </div> for his 
               <div class="hi">Life,</div> so are we to Importune of our Lord Jesus Christ; that He would be concerned for our

               in the days of His flesh, are to be imitated in the Requests which we should make
               unto Him for our Souls. We are to intreat of Him, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I am so Blind, that I cannot see the things of my Peace; Help this Blindness</div>! We are to Entreat of Him, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I am so Lame, that I cannot Run the Way of thy Commandments; Help this Lameness</div>! We are to intreat,

               <div class="hi">Step</div> of our

               <div class="pb"></div>IV. Being thoroughly Apprehensive, that we have no 
               <div class="hi">strength</div> to 
               <div class="hi">come</div> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should first 
               <div class="hi">Cry</div> for that Strength, and then 
               <div class="hi">Try</div> whether we cannot come. As for us, we 
               <div class="hi">cannot</div> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; altho' our Precious and Immortal Souls do justly
               lie at the Stake, if we

               <div class="hi">Come</div> unto the Lord Jesus Christ aright, until we do with much anguish of Soul, see that

               <div class="hi">come</div> or 
               <div class="hi">stir</div> towards Him. Nothing renders men more Incapable of a due 
               <div class="hi">Coming</div> to the Lord Jesus Christ, than a vain and a proud 
               <div class="hi">Opinion</div> of a 
               <div class="hi">Free will</div> in themselves, of it self able to Do this

               <div class="hi">That in all Salvation-work, it is God who works in us, both to Will and to Do, of
                  His own good pleasure.
               </div> 'Tis very unlikely, That God should give us the 
               <div class="hi">Faith</div> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, unless we sub
               <div class="g"></div>scribe to that, in

               <div class="hi">Faith is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</div> It is not likely that God should bestow upon us the 
               <div class="hi">Power</div> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without making us to own that in 
               <div class="hi">Eph.</div> 1.19. 
               <div class="hi">We Be

               </div> It was hardly a stranger thing to see 
               <div class="hi">Peter</div> walking on the Sea,, than to see a Sinner coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. O be sensible
               of this accursed 
               <div class="hi">Impotency</div>! but at the same time see, that without the 
               <div class="hi">Grace</div> of 
               <div class="pb"></div> God we cannot so much as arrive to be thus far sensible. And yet there are two
               <div class="g">▪</div> Things from which we should not be here
               <div class="g"></div>by discouraged.
            </div>
            <div class="p">First, We are to 
               <div class="hi">Cry</div> that God would help us to come. When we are advised of such a thing as that in 
               <div class="hi">John.</div> 6.44. 
               <div class="hi">No man can come unto me, Except the Father which hath sent me, Draw Him</div>: It becomes us then humbly and warmly, to make that moan unto him, in 
               <div class="hi">Cant.</div> 5.4. 
               <div class="hi">O Draw me</div>! We cannot 
               <div class="hi">come</div> to the Lord Jesus Christ, until we 
               <div class="hi">Turn</div>; but how should we do 
               <div class="hi">That</div>? That we may 
               <div class="hi">Turn,</div> the way is to 
               <div class="hi">Cry</div>; make that 
               <div class="hi">Cry,</div> in Jer. 
               <div class="gap">
                  <div class="desc">•</div>
               </div>1.18. 
               <div class="hi">Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</div> O Ly before the Lord, and mourn before him, saying, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I perish, and it is Just I should perish, if I do not come unto thee; but yet
                  I cannot come; a Stone may as soon fly to Heaven, and become a Star in Heaven, as
                  I of my self come to my Hea

                  Glory.
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Secondly; Now 
               <div class="hi">Try</div> whether God will not help us to come Attempt, I say; See, as the well-disposed man,
               at length got so far as in Marc. 9.27. 
               <div class="hi">To say with Tears, Lord, I Believe, Help mine Unbelief!</div> So, see whether you cannot say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, now at Last I come! Lord, now at Last, I can trust my 
                  <div class="pb"></div> Soul in thy Hands, for thee to make me Happy for ever.
               </div> We find, that the man with a 
               <div class="hi">Withered Hand</div> in Math. 12.13. when he 
               <div class="hi">Try'd,</div> could 
               <div class="hi">Stretch</div> it out; Even so, Let us 
               <div class="hi">Try,</div> whether the 
               <div class="hi">Withered Foot</div> of our Souls be not Cured by the 
               <div class="hi">Soveraign Grace</div> of God; and whether we cannot come to what we never could of our selves come unto.
            </div>
            <div class="p">V. They that will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, must Answer and Conquer all the 
               <div class="hi">Objections</div> of unbeleef, against coming to the Lord. You may be sure that when our Faces are once

                  <div class="g"></div>cles

               </div> It was of old thrown upon Him as his Disgrace, 
               <div class="hi">He Receiveth Sinners</div>; but it is his Honour, His Renown. His

               <div class="hi">Kingdom,</div> such as have been Guilty of the very same Sins, that now astonish our Consciences:
               He has Received a 
               <div class="hi">Menasseh</div>; He has Received a

               <div class="hi">Uncleanness,</div> that affrights us? Remember, By 
               <div class="hi">Faith</div> Rahab

            </div>
            <div class="p">Tis Another objection of unbeleef,

            <div class="p">To this objection let us give

               </div> I Insist not on that which many, and especially Jewish Interpreters, assign as the

               a thousand Scriptures conspire to tell us, 
               <div class="hi">That the purpose of God, according to Election shall stand.</div> I Remember, that

               <div class="hi">Intercession</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be Unsuccessful, and Insufficient, if any of them should
               not at last come to be, 
               <div class="hi">With Him, where He is</div>!
            </div>
            <div class="p">In short, If any Name could be Really Blotted out from the 
               <div class="hi">Book of Life,</div> it must be, either, because that God knows not cer
               <div class="g"></div>tainly who will come unto 
               <div class="hi">Life Eternal</div> at the last, or, because God could not confer the 
               <div class="hi">Grace,</div> which is Necessary to bring them unto that 
               <div class="hi">Life.</div> But, it is fit, that such 
               <div class="hi">Pelagian, Arminian, Socinian,</div> Blasphemies, be
               <div class="g"></div>come Abominable among the People of God.
            </div>
            <div class="p">But then, a Second Assertion is,</div>
            <div class="p">That a man, having his 
               <div class="hi">Name</div> written in the Book of Life, may by a Blessed 
               <div class="hi">Assurance</div> of it, be able to 
               <div class="hi">Read</div> it there. Our Lord, said once unto His Disciples, in Luc. 10.20: 
               <div class="hi">Rejoice, because your Names are written in Hea

               <div class="hi">What I say to you, I say to all.</div> So then a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ on earth may with 
               <div class="pb"></div> Joy unspeakable see his Name written, 
               <div class="hi">In Heaven,</div> among them that, 
               <div class="hi">For Heaven,</div> at the last. Why are we enjoyned, in 2.

               <div class="hi">Subject,</div> that we are directed unto the pursuance of: A man by diligence in the Exercise of

               <div class="hi">I have my Name Written a

               </div> The Inse

               <div class="hi">Name written in the Book of Life, may</div> be known by them, that have them. The 
               <div class="hi">Grace</div> of God, wrought in the hearts of them that have their Names in the 
               <div class="hi">Book</div> of God; this is a discernible sort of a Thing; tis compared unto 
               <div class="hi">Fire,</div> unto 
               <div class="hi">Light,</div> unto 
               <div class="hi">Life,</div> which make themselves evident where they are. One Good man has before now been able
               to say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I believe.</div> Another Good man has been able to say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, thou knowest that I Love thee.</div> Yea, but they that are assured of such Things, may readily tell, where their 
               <div class="hi">Names</div> are to be found. Good men may come to say, as in 1: 
               <div class="hi">Joh.</div> 3 14. 
               <div class="hi">We know that we have passed from Death to Life</div>; and this knowledge may assure them, that they have 
               <div class="hi">Names Written in the Book of Life.</div> It was the assurance of a 
               <div class="hi">Job, I know that my Redeemer lives.</div> But such a man may be also assured, that his 
               <div class="hi">Redeemer</div> has written him a

               <div class="pb"></div> them that are to be 
               <div class="hi">Redeemed. It</div> was the assurance of a 
               <div class="hi">David, The Lord is my Shepherd</div>; but such a Man may be also assured, that the 
               <div class="hi">Great Shepherd</div> has written him, among the sheep of his 
               <div class="hi">Right-Hand.</div> It was the assurance of a 
               <div class="hi">Paul, The Son of God has loved me</div>; but he was then likewise assured of a Room in the 
               <div class="hi">Book</div> as well as in the

            <div class="p">And this brings me to that most Impor

               <div class="hi">Assured</div> of a Name, Written in the Book of

            <div class="p">The Roman Historian Reports, that the Son of a Senator, understanding certain Honours

               <div class="hi">Church</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ? Are the 
               <div class="hi">Joyes</div> of the Church, made your own; Are the

               <div class="hi">As being your selves also in the Body?</div> Behold, a
               <div class="g"></div>nother 
               <div class="pb"></div> Demonstration that you are 
               <div class="hi">Members</div> of that 
               <div class="hi">Body.</div> But if you will do something further to put it out of doubt; pray, Joyn your selves
               in 
               <div class="hi">Fellowship,</div> with a particular 
               <div class="hi">Church</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ, walking in the Order of the Gospel. The Apostle speaks in
               Heb. 12.23. about, 
               <div class="hi">The General Assembly, and the Church of the First born, which are Written in Heaven.</div> 'Tis in allusion to the Church of 
               <div class="hi">Israel,</div> Assembled at

               <div class="hi">Assembly of Zion,</div> some Church of the Living God. We read in Isa. 4.3. about some, 
               <div class="hi">Written among the Living in Jerusalem.</div> If any man, don't count it worth the while, for him to have his

               <div class="hi">Live</div> Eternally? I am verily perswaded, That God thus punishes the fault of many a Christian,
               who Lies from year to year out of 
               <div class="hi">Church Fellowship</div>; He punisheth it, by denying them an As

               <div class="hi">Heart</div> full of Magnanimity, and in a grave Speech answered the Accusations. The chief drift

                  <div class="hi">Trinity</div> in God? I will answer, as 
                  <div class="hi">Athanasius</div> of old; 
                  <div class="hi">Go to Jordan, and thou shalt see a Trinity.</div> In Mat. 3.16, 17. On the Banks of 
                  <div class="hi">Jordan,</div> 
                  <div class="pb"></div> there at once discovered themselves. The

                  <div class="hi">Son,</div> and the 
                  <div class="hi">Holy Spirit.</div> Tho' indeed a 
                  <div class="hi">Trinity</div> of persons in the God
                  <div class="g"></div>head, might from the Old Testament also be Evinced, unto the fullest confutation of
                  the Blind 
                  <div class="hi">Jews,</div> who now deny the 
                  <div class="hi">Mystery.</div> Now, there is the Glorious Co-o

                  <div class="hi">Three Persons</div> in every Act of God, of which the Creature is the 
                  <div class="hi">Object</div>; yet there is a 
                  <div class="hi">distinct manner</div> of wor
                  <div class="g"></div>king to be ascribed unto each of them. Thus in the 
                  <div class="hi">Salvation</div> of a Sinner, the Work of 
                  <div class="hi">Contriving</div> that Salvation, belongs to God the 
                  <div class="hi">Father</div>; the Work of 
                  <div class="hi">Effecting</div> it, be

                  <div class="hi">Son</div>; But the Work of 
                  <div class="hi">Applying</div> it, belongs to God the 
                  <div class="hi">Holy Spirit.</div> And thence the

                  <div class="hi">Holy Spirit</div> has a special In

                  <div class="hi">Converted</div> unto God, how is it wrought? We are told, Tit. 3.5. 'Tis by the 
                  <div class="hi">Renewing of the Holy Ghost.</div> The

                  <div class="hi">Wants</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">Woes,</div> by doing so; He convinces them, that a precious 
                  <div class="hi">Christ,</div> embraced by a penitent 
                  <div class="hi">Faith,</div> is the 
                  <div class="hi">One Thing Needful</div>; How of
                  <div class="g"></div>ten does He Convince men, That there is a God, in whose 
                  <div class="hi">Favour is Life,</div>; that there is a 
                  <div class="hi">Jesus,</div> who 
                  <div class="hi">delivers from the Wrath to come</div>; that they must Rely upon the Lord Christ for

                  <div class="hi">Convert the World.</div>
               </div>
               <div class="p">Secondly The Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by 
                  <div class="hi">Affecting of them.</div> And there are three things, which the Spirit of God affects many men into, when He
                  is making 
                  <div class="hi">Essays</div> towards the Converting of them.
               </div>
               <div class="p">First, There are dismal 
                  <div class="hi">Terrours</div> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver

                  </div>ightens them with a just Apprehensi
                  <div class="g"></div>on, that if they continue as they are, 
                  <div class="hi">He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them
                     no fa

                  </div> We read in Rom. 8.15. about the 
                  <div class="hi">Spirit of bondage unto fear.</div> The Spirit of God makes many a man see himself 
                  <div class="hi">bound</div> over to endure the 
                  <div class="hi">Fearful</div> and Fiery Wrath of God for ever; He enkindles in them a 
                  <div class="hi">Fear,</div> that He is 
                  <div class="hi">angry with them every day,</div> and that He will 
                  <div class="hi">break them sore in the place of Dragons at the Last Day.</div> Thus the Spirit made 
                  <div class="hi">Faelix</div> to 
                  <div class="hi">tremble,</div> in the Fore-bodings of a 
                  <div class="hi">Judgment to come.</div>
               </div>
               <div class="p">Secondly, There are serious 
                  <div class="hi">Desires,</div> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver
                  <div class="g"></div>ted men. He inflames warm desires in them after the 
                  <div class="hi">Things of their Peace:</div> and raises 
                  <div class="pb"></div> in them some Longings after 
                  <div class="hi">Spiritual Bles
                     <div class="g"></div>sings in heavenly matters in Christ Jesus.
                  </div> 'Tis the 
                  <div class="hi">Spirit</div> of God, that made the Jews cry out, Joh. 6.35. Lord,

                  <div class="hi">that my sin were pardoned</div>! and, 
                  <div class="hi">O that my heart were mollified</div>! and, 
                  <div class="hi">O that my Soul were bound up in the Bun

               </div>
               <div class="p">Thirdly, There are Devout 
                  <div class="hi">Resolves,</div> which the Spirit of God often causes in Unconverted men. He fills them with 
                  <div class="hi">Re
                     <div class="g"></div>solves,
                  </div> to 
                  <div class="hi">break off their sins by Righteousness</div>: and with many purposes and intentions, that they will walk at 
                  <div class="hi">Peradventures</div> with God no more. 'Twas the Spirit of God that procured such an Inclination as that
                  in them of old, Jer. 2.10. 
                  <div class="hi">Thou sayest</div> I 
                  <div class="hi">will not transgress.</div> The Spirit of God puts many upon such Resolutions, 
                  <div class="hi">I have done Iniquity, but I</div> will 
                  <div class="hi">do so no more.</div> The 
                  <div class="hi">Vows</div> men make, when a Dreadful Eternity is before their eyes

               </div>
               <div class="p">Multitudes of wretched sinners

                  <div class="hi">Methods</div> used by the Holy Spirit for the Conversion of their Souls; and in so doing they 
                  <div class="hi">Resist the Holy Ghost.</div> But how is this done? The Greek word here 
                  <div class="hi">to Resist</div> signifies 
                  <div class="hi">To throw something in the way,</div> to hinder the

                  <div class="hi">way</div> of the Holy Spirit, so that He makes a stop, a stand, He goes no further in it; This
                  'tis to

                  <div class="hi">Ego Sum,</div> Sir, 'tis

                  <div class="hi">Image</div> of God; by defacing the Impressions of Hell that had been made upon us. There is a
                  marvellous 
                  <div class="hi">A
                     <div class="g"></div>greement
                  </div> now between God and Man; wherein though not the 
                  <div class="hi">Essence,</div> nor the 
                  <div class="hi">Greatness</div> of God, yet a Resemblance of His HOLINESS is in a blessed measure Communicated unto
                  the man thus, 
                  <div class="hi">Born again.</div> It may be said of him, 
                  <div class="hi">He is a man after Gods own Heart</div>; he 
                  <div class="hi">Likes,</div> he 
                  <div class="hi">Loves,</div> he 
                  <div class="hi">Lives</div> after such a manner as to de

                  <div class="hi">Holiness,</div> which is Infinite in the 
                  <div class="hi">Holy One of Israel.</div> Hence, a Regenerate man studies a most exact Conformity to the Example of the Lord
                  Jesus Christ, and Attains very much of what he studies. As a Renowned Minister could
                  say, 
                  <div class="hi">When I am to Preach a Sermon,</div> I 
                  <div class="hi">set my self to think, How would Jesus Christ Preach, were He to Handle my Subject</div>! So a Regenerate man sometimes thinks, 
                  <div class="hi">How did the Blessed Jesus do such a Duty?</div> or, 
                  <div class="hi">How did the bles
                     <div class="g"></div>sed 
                     <div class="pb"></div> Jesus bear such a Trial
                  </div>? and then he endeavours to go 
                  <div class="hi">and do Likewise.</div> A Re
                  <div class="g"></div>generate man, is a CHRISTIAN in reality; that is, 
                  <div class="hi">A Christ-like man</div>; and it may be said of such ones, 
                  <div class="hi">As thou art, so are they

                  <div class="hi">Repentance,</div> and the 
                  <div class="hi">Faith,</div> so called for. Such is the REPEN
                  <div class="g"></div>TANCE 
                  <div class="pb"></div> of a Regenerate man; that he looks on his manifold sinfulness both by

                  <div class="hi">Lord,</div> I

               <div class="hi">What God has thus Joyned, Let no man put asunder!</div> Yea, a man should not forbear Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, altho' he can see nothing,
               but 
               <div class="hi">Self,</div> stirring him thereunto; Let him come, tho' it be at first upon 
               <div class="hi">Meaner Ends; that</div> will be the way for him to obtain an Impression of

               <div class="hi">The End of our Faith</div>? 'tis to be,

               </div> of that

               <div class="hi">Dividing</div> of his

               <div class="hi">Dividing</div> of His 
               <div class="hi">Mercies,</div> Well then, Let us ponder with our selves, what a

            <div class="p">Particularly, 
               <div class="hi">Atonement,</div> is one of those things which we are to come unto the Lord Jesus for. We are to come
               unto Him, as He is represented in Psal. 110.4. 
               <div class="hi">Thou art a Priest for ever!</div> He demands of

               <div class="g"></div>to his being so; therewithal, saying like the Psalmist, in Psal. 119. 122. 
               <div class="hi">O be surety for thy servant for good.</div> We must come unto Him, as unto,

               <div class="hi">Him, That Loves us, and washes us from our sins in His own Blood</div>; Come unto Him, as unto that Jesus who having made

               <div class="hi">Intercession</div> for us, at the Right Hand of God
               <div class="g">▪</div> above. We must ask to enjoy such a JESUS in him! yea, and at the same time, we should

            <div class="p">Again, 
               <div class="hi">Instruction</div> is another of those things 
               <div class="pb"></div> which we are to come unto the Lord Je

               <div class="hi">Art thou willing that I should be the Prophet of thy Soul</div>! and we must sincere

               <div class="hi">Shew me thy Ways, O Lord; Teach me thy Paths.</div> We must come unto Him, for that 
               <div class="hi">Eye salve</div> whereof He hath said,

               in the days of His flesh, are to be imitated in the Requests which we should make
               unto Him for our Souls. We are to intreat of Him, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I am so Blind, that I cannot see the things of my Peace; Help this Blindness</div>! We are to Entreat of Him,

            <div class="p">Thirdly, We must come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, with a Lively

               <div class="hi">Step</div> of our

               </div> Like the ancient Psalmist, having first with bitter strivings pleaded before the Lord

            <div class="p">
               <div class="pb"></div>IV. Being thoroughly Apprehensive, that we have no 
               <div class="hi">strength</div> to 
               <div class="hi">come</div> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should first 
               <div class="hi">Cry</div> for that Strength, and then 
               <div class="hi">Try</div> whether we cannot come. As for us, we 
               <div class="hi">cannot</div> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; altho' our Precious and Immortal Souls do justly
               lie at the Stake, if we 
               <div class="hi">Do not come.</div> And we never shall 
               <div class="hi">Come</div> unto the Lord Jesus Christ aright, until we do with much anguish of Soul, see that
               we cannot 
               <div class="hi">come</div> or 
               <div class="hi">stir</div> towards Him. Nothing renders men more Incapable of a due 
               <div class="hi">Coming</div> to the Lord Jesus Christ, than a vain and a proud 
               <div class="hi">Opinion</div> of a 
               <div class="hi">Free will</div> in themselves, of it self able to Do this 
               <div class="hi">Good Work</div>; Or than forgetting, 
               <div class="hi">That in all Salvation-work, it is God who works in us, both to Will and to Do, of
                  His own good pleasure.
               </div> 'Tis very unlikely, That God should give us the 
               <div class="hi">Faith</div> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, unless we sub
               <div class="g"></div>scribe to that, in 
               <div class="hi">Eph.</div> 2.8. 
               <div class="hi">Faith is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</div> It is not likely that God should bestow upon us the 
               <div class="hi">Power</div> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without making us to own that in 
               <div class="hi">Eph.</div> 1.19. 
               <div class="hi">We Be
                  <div class="g"></div>lieve, according to the working of His mighty Power.
               </div> It was hardly a stranger thing to see 
               <div class="hi">Peter</div> walking on the Sea,, than to see a Sinner coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. O be sensible
               of this accursed 
               <div class="hi">Impotency</div>! but at the same time see, that without the 
               <div class="hi">Grace</div> of 
               <div class="pb"></div> God we cannot so much as arrive to be thus far sensible. And yet there are two
               <div class="g">▪</div> Things from which we should not be here
               <div class="g"></div>by discouraged.
            </div>
            <div class="p">First, We are to 
               <div class="hi">Cry</div> that God would help us to come. When we are advised of such a thing as that in 
               <div class="hi">John.</div> 6.44. 
               <div class="hi">No man can come unto me, Except the Father which hath sent me, Draw Him</div>: It becomes us then humbly and warmly, to make that moan unto him, in 
               <div class="hi">Cant.</div> 5.4. 
               <div class="hi">O Draw me</div>! We cannot 
               <div class="hi">come</div> to the Lord Jesus Christ, until we 
               <div class="hi">Turn</div>; but how should we do 
               <div class="hi">That</div>? That we may 
               <div class="hi">Turn,</div> the way is to 
               <div class="hi">Cry</div>; make that 
               <div class="hi">Cry,</div> in Jer. 
               <div class="gap">
                  <div class="desc">•</div>
               </div>1.18. 
               <div class="hi">Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</div> O Ly before the Lord, and mourn before him, saying, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I perish, and it is Just I should perish, if I do not come unto thee; but yet
                  I cannot come; a Stone may as soon fly to Heaven, and become a Star in Heaven, as
                  I of my self come to my Hea
                  <div class="g"></div>venly Lord; O do thou then Help me to come, and so Grace, Grace, will have all the
                  Glory.
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Secondly; Now 
               <div class="hi">Try</div> whether God will not help us to come Attempt, I say; See, as the well-disposed man,
               at length got so far as in Marc. 9.27. 
               <div class="hi">To say with Tears, Lord, I Believe, Help mine Unbelief!</div> So, see whether you cannot say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, now at Last I come! Lord, now at Last, I can trust my 
                  <div class="pb"></div> Soul in thy Hands, for thee to make me Happy for ever.
               </div> We find, that the man with a 
               <div class="hi">Withered Hand</div> in Math. 12.13. when he 
               <div class="hi">Try'd,</div> could 
               <div class="hi">Stretch</div> it out; Even so, Let us 
               <div class="hi">Try,</div> whether the 
               <div class="hi">Withered Foot</div> of our Souls be not Cured by the 
               <div class="hi">Soveraign Grace</div> of God; and whether we cannot come to what we never could of our selves come unto.
            </div>
            <div class="p">V. They that will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, must Answer and Conquer all the 
               <div class="hi">Objections</div> of unbeleef, against coming to the Lord. You may be sure that when our Faces are once

                  <div class="g"></div>cles
               </div> will be cast before us, by 
               <div class="hi">An evil heart of unbeleef.</div> But as the ways to the 
               <div class="hi">City of Refuge,</div> were Exactly and carefully cleared, among the

               hinder us, in 
               <div class="hi">Flying for Refuge to the Hope set before us.</div> As now,

               </div> Let our Answer to this objection, be, 
               <div class="hi">that</div> in 1.

               </div> It was of old thrown upon Him as his Disgrace, 
               <div class="hi">He Receiveth Sinners</div>; but it is his Honour, His Renown. His

               <div class="hi">Kingdom,</div> such as have been Guilty of the very same Sins, that now astonish our Consciences:
               He has Received a 
               <div class="hi">Menasseh</div>; He has Received a 
               <div class="hi">Mary Magdalene.</div> Is it the Sin of 
               <div class="hi">Uncleanness,</div> that affrights us? Remember, By 
               <div class="hi">Faith</div> Rahab

            <div class="p">Tis Another objection of unbeleef,

               they are that we may be made 
               <div class="hi">willing</div> to come. So then, if we do but find our selves 
               <div class="hi">willing</div> to have the Lord Jesus Christ, we need not scruple our liberty to come unto him. Are
               we so affected with our 
               <div class="hi">Ignorance,</div> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ should be our 
               <div class="hi">Wisdom</div>? Are we so concerned about our

               <div class="hi">Righteousness</div> by our Lord Jesus Christ? Are we so troubled for our 
               <div class="hi">Pollutions,</div> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, should be our 
               <div class="hi">Sanctification? Is</div> our 
               <div class="hi">Captivity</div> so Irksome to us, that we are willing to have 
               <div class="hi">Redemption</div> by the Lord Jesus Christ? Then 
               <div class="hi">Come,</div> in Gods Name; say not,

               <div class="hi">Come,</div> without any further Hesitation. We must not imagine to come unto our Lord Jesus Christ,
               with any Re

               </div> It is not under the Notion of

               <div class="hi">perishing</div> Sinners, that we are to come unto Him. We would fain come unto Him

               <div class="hi">for,</div> what we cannot come unto Him 
               <div class="hi">with.</div> Never stand pausing, whether you have under
               <div class="g"></div>gone such Degrees of 
               <div class="hi">Compunction</div> and 
               <div class="hi">Contrition</div>; beware lest you make a 
               <div class="hi">Christ</div> of those things; but if you 
               <div class="hi">can</div> come, 
               <div class="hi">Do</div>; or however 
               <div class="hi">Do</div> what you 
               <div class="hi">can</div> to come. Do not say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, Depart from me, for I am sinful man</div>; but say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, because</div> I 
               <div class="hi">am a sinful man, therefore</div> I 
               <div class="hi">will come unto thee.</div> Or argue at such a rate as the Lepers did, 
               <div class="hi">Be sure, if</div> I

            <div class="p">VI. Because we have hearts most unac

               <div class="hi">Godliness which is profitable to all things.</div> Come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately, the God of Heaven will say to you, 
               <div class="hi">Be of Good Chear, thy sins are forgiven thee</div>! Immediately the same God of Heaven, will say,

               not at last come to be,

            </div>
            <div class="p">In short, If any Name could be Really Blotted out from the 
               <div class="hi">Book of Life,</div> it must be, either, because that God knows not cer
               <div class="g"></div>tainly who will come unto 
               <div class="hi">Life Eternal</div> at the last, or, because God could not confer the 
               <div class="hi">Grace,</div> which is Necessary to bring them unto that 
               <div class="hi">Life.</div> But, it is fit, that such 
               <div class="hi">Pelagian, Arminian, Socinian,</div> Blasphemies, be
               <div class="g"></div>come Abominable among the People of God.
            </div>
            <div class="p">But then, a Second Assertion is,</div>
            <div class="p">That a man, having his 
               <div class="hi">Name</div> written in the Book of Life, may by a Blessed 
               <div class="hi">Assurance</div> of it, be able to 
               <div class="hi">Read</div> it there. Our Lord, said once unto His Disciples, in Luc. 10.20: 
               <div class="hi">Rejoice, because your Names are written in Hea

               <div class="hi">What I say to you, I say to all.</div> So then a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ on earth may with 
               <div class="pb"></div> Joy unspeakable see his Name written, 
               <div class="hi">In Heaven,</div> among them that, 
               <div class="hi">For Heaven,</div> at the last. Why are we enjoyned, in 2.

               <div class="hi">Subject,</div> that we are directed unto the pursuance of: A man by diligence in the Exercise of

               <div class="hi">I have my Name Written a

               </div> The Inse

               <div class="hi">Name written in the Book of Life, may</div> be known by them, that have them. The 
               <div class="hi">Grace</div> of God, wrought in the hearts of them that have their Names in the 
               <div class="hi">Book</div> of God; this is a discernible sort of a Thing; tis compared unto 
               <div class="hi">Fire,</div> unto 
               <div class="hi">Light,</div> unto 
               <div class="hi">Life,</div> which make themselves evident where they are. One Good man has before now been able
               to say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, I believe.</div> Another Good man has been able to say, 
               <div class="hi">Lord, thou knowest that I Love thee.</div> Yea, but they that are assured of such Things, may readily tell, where their 
               <div class="hi">Names</div> are to be found. Good men may come to say, as in 1: 
               <div class="hi">Joh.</div> 3 14. 
               <div class="hi">We know that we have passed from Death to Life</div>; and this knowledge may assure them, that they have 
               <div class="hi">Names Written in the Book of Life.</div> It was the assurance of a 
               <div class="hi">Job, I know that my Redeemer lives.</div> But such a man may be also assured, that his 
               <div class="hi">Redeemer</div> has written him a

               <div class="pb"></div> them that are to be 
               <div class="hi">Redeemed. It</div> was the assurance of a 
               <div class="hi">David, The Lord is my Shepherd</div>; but such a Man may be also assured, that the 
               <div class="hi">Great Shepherd</div> has written him, among the sheep of his 
               <div class="hi">Right-Hand.</div> It was the assurance of a

            <div class="p">And this brings me to that most Impor
               <div class="g"></div>tant CASE. What should a Man do, that he may be 
               <div class="hi">Assured</div> of a Name, Written in the Book of

            <div class="p">The Roman Historian Reports, that the Son of a Senator, understanding certain Honours

                  out for the Members of Christ Mystical.
               </div> Yea, But how shall a man know that he belongs to the 
               <div class="hi">Mystical Body</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ? I'll tell you, 
               <div class="hi">How</div>? Are you Acted by the same

               <div class="pb"></div> Actuates all the Rest of His Body? Is the the Lord Jesus Christ a 
               <div class="hi">Quickning Spirit</div> unto 
               <div class="hi">you,</div> as He is unto the Rest of them, that are United unto Himself? We read of 
               <div class="hi">Names Written in the Earth</div>; so 'tis, When we have 
               <div class="hi">Hearts cleaving to the Earth.</div> Some there are, that never think, they have 
               <div class="hi">Earth</div> enough, and that subordinate all things to the getting of 
               <div class="hi">Earth.</div> Such men are strangers to the 
               <div class="hi">Spirit</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ; God knows, whether they have 
               <div class="hi">Names Written in Heaven,</div> or no. But pray, mark what I say; the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, Inclines all that
               belong un
               <div class="g"></div>to Him, To prefer a Christ above a World; and to abhor and avoid every 
               <div class="hi">Sin,</div> as the worst Evil in the World; It inclines them all, to prize 
               <div class="hi">Communion</div> with God, in the Devotions of Christianity, above all the Delights of this Life: It
               inclines them all, to do all the Good they can, unto all that are about them. Say
               now, Are you Led by this 
               <div class="hi">Holy Spirit</div> of the Lord, or no? If you are, Then I say, That you are in the 
               <div class="hi">Holy Body</div> of the Lord. Let me add, How are you concerned for the 
               <div class="hi">Church</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ? Are the 
               <div class="hi">Joyes</div> of the Church, made your own; Are the

               <div class="hi">As being your selves also in the Body?</div> Behold, a

               <div class="hi">Members</div> of that

               in 
               <div class="hi">Fellowship,</div> with a particular 
               <div class="hi">Church</div> of the Lord Jesus Christ, walking in the Order of the Gospel. The Apostle speaks in
               Heb. 12.23. about, 
               <div class="hi">The General Assembly, and the Church of the First born, which are Written in Heaven.</div> 'Tis in allusion to the Church of 
               <div class="hi">Israel,</div> Assembled at

               <div class="hi">Assembly of Zion,</div> some Church of the Living God. We read in Isa. 4.3. about some, 
               <div class="hi">Written among the Living in Jerusalem.</div> If any man, don't count it worth the while, for him to have his

               <div class="hi">Live</div> Eternally? I am verily perswaded, That God thus punishes the fault of many a Christian,
               who Lies from year to year out of 
               <div class="hi">Church Fellowship</div>; He punisheth it, by denying them an As

                  <div class="hi">Athanasius</div> of old; 
                  <div class="hi">Go to Jordan, and thou shalt see a Trinity.</div> In Mat. 3.16, 17. On the Banks of

                  <div class="hi">Son,</div> and the

                  <div class="g"></div>head, might from the Old Testament also be Evinced, unto the fullest confutation of
                  the Blind 
                  <div class="hi">Jews,</div> who now deny the

                  <div class="hi">Three Persons</div> in every Act of God, of which the Creature is the

                  <div class="g"></div>king to be ascribed unto each of them. Thus in the 
                  <div class="hi">Salvation</div> of a Sinner, the Work of 
                  <div class="hi">Contriving</div> that Salvation, belongs to God the

                  <div class="hi">Applying</div> it, belongs to God the 
                  <div class="hi">Holy Spirit.</div> And thence the

                  <div class="hi">Holy Spirit</div> has a special In

                  <div class="hi">Renewing of the Holy Ghost.</div> The

               </div>
               <div class="p">First, the Holy Spirit attempts the Conver

                  <div class="hi">Holy Spirit</div> Enables many a man to 
                  <div class="hi">Understand</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">En

                  <div class="g"></div>tant Thing before them. 'Tis said of the Holy Spirit, 
                  <div class="hi">Joh.</div> 16.18. 
                  <div class="hi">He shall convince the World.</div> He convinces them, that they have grievously

                  <div class="g"></div>selves into innumerable 
                  <div class="hi">Wants</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">Woes,</div> by doing so; He convinces them, that a precious

                  <div class="g"></div>ten does He Convince men, That there is a God, in whose

                  <div class="hi">Redemption,</div> if they would be made partakers of true Blessedness? And this is that he may 
                  <div class="hi">Convert the World.</div>
               </div>
               <div class="p">Secondly The Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by 
                  <div class="hi">Affecting of them.</div> And there are three things, which the Spirit of God affects many men into, when He
                  is making 
                  <div class="hi">Essays</div> towards the Converting of them.
               </div>
               <div class="p">First, There are dismal 
                  <div class="hi">Terrours</div> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver
                  <div class="g"></div>ted men. He terrifies them with hideous Visions of their own 
                  <div class="hi">Wretchedness</div> and 
                  <div class="hi">Misery</div>: and aff

                  </div>ightens them with a just Apprehensi
                  <div class="g"></div>on, that if they continue as they are, 
                  <div class="hi">He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them
                     no fa
                     <div class="g"></div>vour.
                  </div> We read in Rom. 8.15. about the 
                  <div class="hi">Spirit of bondage unto fear.</div> The Spirit of God makes many a man see himself 
                  <div class="hi">bound</div> over to endure the 
                  <div class="hi">Fearful</div> and Fiery Wrath of God for ever; He enkindles in them a 
                  <div class="hi">Fear,</div> that He is 
                  <div class="hi">angry with them every day,</div> and that He will 
                  <div class="hi">break them sore in the place of Dragons at the Last Day.</div> Thus the Spirit made 
                  <div class="hi">Faelix</div> to 
                  <div class="hi">tremble,</div> in the Fore-bodings of a 
                  <div class="hi">Judgment to come.</div>
               </div>
               <div class="p">Secondly, There are serious 
                  <div class="hi">Desires,</div> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver
                  <div class="g"></div>ted men. He inflames warm desires in them after the 
                  <div class="hi">Things of their Peace:</div> and raises 
                  <div class="pb"></div> in them some Longings after 
                  <div class="hi">Spiritual Bles
                     <div class="g"></div>sings in heavenly matters in Christ Jesus.
                  </div> 'Tis the 
                  <div class="hi">Spirit</div> of God, that made the Jews cry out, Joh. 6.35. Lord, 
                  <div class="hi">give us evermore the Bread of Life.</div> The Spirit of God makes many a man desirous, O 
                  <div class="hi">that my sin were pardoned</div>! and, 
                  <div class="hi">O that my heart were mollified</div>! and, 
                  <div class="hi">O that my Soul were bound up in the Bun

                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="p">Thirdly, There are Devout 
                  <div class="hi">Resolves,</div> which the Spirit of God often causes in Unconverted men. He fills them with 
                  <div class="hi">Re
                     <div class="g"></div>solves,
                  </div> to 
                  <div class="hi">break off their sins by Righteousness</div>: and with many purposes and intentions, that they will walk at 
                  <div class="hi">Peradventures</div> with God no more. 'Twas the Spirit of God that procured such an Inclination as that
                  in them of old, Jer. 2.10. 
                  <div class="hi">Thou sayest</div> I 
                  <div class="hi">will not transgress.</div> The Spirit of God puts many upon such Resolutions, 
                  <div class="hi">I have done Iniquity, but I</div> will 
                  <div class="hi">do so no more.</div> The 
                  <div class="hi">Vows</div> men make, when a Dreadful Eternity is before their eyes
                  <div class="g">▪</div> their Sick-bed Vows, and Sea-storm Vows and the Vows which they make when Di

                  <div class="hi">Spirit</div> of God. Thus the 
                  <div class="hi">Spirit</div> of God was concerned with

               </div>
               <div class="p">Multitudes of wretched sinners 
                  <div class="hi">Resist</div> the 
                  <div class="hi">Methods</div> used by the Holy Spirit for the Conversion of their Souls; and in so doing they 
                  <div class="hi">Resist the Holy Ghost.</div> But how is this done? The Greek word here 
                  <div class="hi">to Resist</div> signifies 
                  <div class="hi">To throw something in the way,</div> to hinder the 
                  <div class="hi">Passage</div> or 
                  <div class="hi">Journey</div> of a
                  <div class="g"></div>nother. The Spirit of God is in the 
                  <div class="hi">way</div> of Converting many a man, but the mad sinner will throw, something or other in the 
                  <div class="hi">way</div> of the Holy Spirit, so that He makes a stop, a stand, He goes no further in it; This
                  'tis to 
                  <div class="hi">Resist the Holy Ghost.</div> Particularly;

               <div class="p">First, Unconverted Sinners,

                  <div class="hi">Business.</div> When the Spirit would have been Recovering of wicked 
                  <div class="hi">Cain</div> from his forlorn estate, we find in Gen. 4.17. He went away to 
                  <div class="hi">building of Cities.</div> Men so get and keep in the clattering noise of the

                  leisure enough, to do any thing upon them. Or, the Holy Spirit cannot come at them,
                  be

                  <div class="hi">What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me.</div> Thus does the Holy Spirit of God plead with you, 
                  <div class="hi">What Injury have I done thee,

                     <div class="hi">The Holy Ghost saith,</div> he puts that Re

                     <div class="hi">He saies, to Day, after so long a Time, harden not your hearts.</div> This may I say, Behold

                     <div class="hi">Injustice</div> you have given to the Holy Ghost, He still begs of you, 
                     <div class="hi">O that you would be Converted unto God</div>! The crys of the Holy Spirit in your ears are those in Ruth 1.16. 
                     <div class="hi">Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee.</div> Have you not 
                     <div class="hi">Outward Offers</div> of the Gospel made unto you? at this very instant you have them. We read in Rev. 22.15. 
                     <div class="hi">The Spirit saith come, and whosoever will let him come, and take of the Waters of
                        Life freely.
