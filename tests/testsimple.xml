         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there are, <hi>Unutterable Things</hi>: 'tis Consisting of, and Surrounded with <hi>Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> That Unaccountable Thing which is in <hi>Regeneration</hi> bestow'd upon us, is called, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>The Hidden Man of the Heart.</hi> What the Wise man says, about <hi>Generation,</hi> may be said about <hi>Regeneration</hi> too, <hi>We know not the way of the Spirit in us</hi>!

wrought in every <hi>Regenerate</hi> Man. Indeed the <hi>Substance</hi> of one Soul is not Removed or Dissolved in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and the <hi>Substance</hi> of an other Introduced, as the Jews fondly fancy'd.

                     </gap>ge</hi> is undergone by the <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Man; he is <hi>born again,</hi> that is, he is one come into another world, and has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of Living in that world, than before; he is, as we find him called, in Eph. 4.23. <hi>A Renewed Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, It is a REAL <hi>Change,</hi> that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man</hi> has pass'd upon him. 'Tis not meerly a <hi>Relative</hi> Change; and so the Change in <hi>Regeneration</hi> differs from that in <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> In one there is a Change of <hi>Estate,</hi> in t'other a change of <hi>Temper.</hi> In <hi>that,</hi> the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin is Blotted out; in <hi>this,</hi> the the <hi>Filth</hi> of Sin is wash'd away. <hi>That</hi> is a <hi>Sentence</hi> on the Sinner; like that in 2 Sam.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000654_0014_0FA99EC32965DAC8"/>
12.13. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not dy. This</hi> is a <hi>Filling</hi> of the Sinner; as we may read, Eph. 2.1. <hi>You hath he filled, who were Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</hi> Nor is it meerly a <hi>Nominal</hi> or a <hi>Notional</hi> Change: 'tis no Brain-sick Imagination. We have one picture of this Change drawn from <hi>Inanimate</hi> Things; in Isa. 55.13. <hi>Instead of the Thorn, shall come up the Fir tree, and instead of the Briar, shall come up the Myrtle-tree.</hi> We have another shadow of this Change, fetch'd from <hi>Animate</hi> Things; in Isa. 11.6. <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid.</hi> In <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> thus it is; the man varies from what once he was, as much as a <hi>Fir</hi> from a <hi>Thorn,</hi> as much as a <hi>Lamb</hi> from a <hi>Wolf</hi>! Thus, One of the Primitive Christians, after his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, being met by an Idolater of his old Acquaintance, had that Salutation from him, <hi>Ego Sum,</hi> Sir, 'tis <hi>I</hi>? whereupon he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>At Ego non sum Ego</hi>; But Sir, <hi>'Tis not I</hi>; I am not the man I was. We may therefore add,</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a THOROUGH <hi>Change</hi> that passes upon the <hi>Regenerate</hi> Man. <hi>Of</hi> and <hi>by</hi> such a man, 'tis said in 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>Old things are past away, behold, all things are become New</hi>; as the <hi>Conflagration</hi> at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Regenerate man has the <hi>Fruits,</hi> of which the Spirit of God is the Author; even the <hi>peaceable Fruits of Righteousness</hi>; but he hath also a <hi>gracious Principle,</hi> called by <hi>John,</hi> in 1 Ep. 3.9. <hi>The SEED of God,</hi> from whence they do proceed. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man has the <hi>Streams</hi> of much Goodness in his Conversation, whereby is <hi>made Glad the City of God,</hi> which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto; but the Source of them is a <hi>gracious Principle,</hi> which our Lord calls in Joh. 4.14. <hi>A WELL of Water springing up to Everlasting Life.</hi> The Regenerate man has the <hi>Light</hi> of those <hi>Good Works,</hi> which do so shine before men, as that the <hi>Heavenly Father is thereby Glorify'd</hi>: but the continual supply thereof is from the <hi>gracious Principle</hi> which our Saviour calls, in Mat. 25.4. <hi>OYL in the Vessel.</hi> There is in the Regenerate man, that which is called, in 2 Pet. 1.4.

As a man that is bitten by a <hi>Mad Dog,</hi> horribly <hi>Barks,</hi> and Howls, and Laps, just like the Creature which Enven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om'd him; so has the Infection convey'd unto us, by the Breath and Sting of our Tempter, <hi>The Great Red Old Dragon,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now <hi>Regeneration</hi> happily Recovers in us, the thus Impaired <hi>Image</hi> of God; by defacing the Impressions of Hell that had been made upon us. There is a marvellous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi> now between God and Man; wherein though not the <hi>Essence,</hi> nor the <hi>Greatness</hi> of God, yet a Resemblance of His HOLINESS is in a blessed measure Communicated unto the man thus, <hi>Born again.</hi> It may be said of him, <hi>He is a man after Gods own Heart</hi>; he <hi>Likes,</hi> he <hi>Loves,</hi> he <hi>Lives</hi> after such a manner as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto all serious Beholders, a little of that <hi>Holiness,</hi> which is Infinite in the <hi>Holy One of Israel.</hi> Hence, a Regenerate man studies a most exact Conformity to the Example of the Lord Jesus Christ, and Attains very much of what he studies. As a Renowned Minister could say, <hi>When I am to Preach a Sermon,</hi> I <hi>set my self to think, How would Jesus Christ Preach, were He to Handle my Subject</hi>! So a Regenerate man sometimes thinks, <hi>How did the Blessed Jesus do such a Duty?</hi> or, <hi>How did the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Jesus bear such a Trial</hi>? and then he endeavours to go <hi>and do Likewise.</hi> A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, is a CHRISTIAN in reality; that is, <hi>A Christ-like man</hi>; and it may be said of such ones, <hi>As thou art, so are they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each one Resembling the Children of a King.</hi> What shall I say? The view of the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Vertue and Carriage in our Lord Jesus, even <hi>Transforms</hi> the Regenerate man, till he be, <hi>Changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory.</hi> Unto this we will annex but one Conclusion more: and O that you might <hi>Feel,</hi> what you are now to <hi>Hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Gracious <hi>Principle,</hi> which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores the <hi>Image</hi> of God, in a <hi>Regenerate</hi> man, inclines him to comply with the CALLS of God, in the GOSPEL.

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gospel Priviledges</hi> may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by a man that is Unregenerate. What the Psalmist said about the <hi>City,</hi> we may say about the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> of God, <hi>Glorious Things are spoken of thee</hi>! But until by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation Men are Naturalized, in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> they cannot lay claim to those <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Things. 'Tis Regeneration</hi> that helps us to that <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> without which, if we come to the Gospel Table, the Great <hi>King</hi> will say unto us, <hi>How camest thou hither</hi>?</p>
               <p>But particularly, The Unregenerate Man can have no <hi>Union</hi> with the Lord Jesus Christ: No, He is yet in the <hi>First Adam.</hi> A man cannot be United unto the <hi>Heavenly Adam,</hi> without the <hi>Heavenly Image.</hi> 'Tis in Regeneration, that we come to be Grafted

Said the Apostle, in 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>In Christ Jesus, I have Begotten you, thro' the Gospel:</hi> so then, if the <hi>Gospel</hi> were always in your Eyes or Ears, 'tis Likely that you might be, <hi>Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Christ Jesus.</hi> The Breath of <hi>Satan</hi> was that which did corrupt you, and the

The Cry of <hi>Bondage</hi> is, <hi>Look after the Redemption of your souls; Ask the Son of God that you may be free indeed; Get out of the Bond of Iniquity</hi>! The Cry of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> is, <hi>Lay up a Treasure in Heaven. Do you want food! Be concerned about the Meat which Endures to everlasting Life. Do you want Clothes?

Be sollicitous for a Room in the Fathers House, where there are many Mansions</hi>!

               <p>And yet again; You have a <hi>Time,</hi> but it is an <hi>Only</hi> Time.

unto that <hi>Commandment</hi> of God, we have here a most compassionate <hi>Invitation</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by, <hi>Coming to Him,</hi> He means nothing more nor less than, <hi>Believing on his Name.</hi> The <hi>Feast of Tabernacles</hi> held in <hi>September,</hi> with an Anniversary Observation among the ancient Jews, Typically Represented the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, probably at that very time of the Year, first came to <hi>Tabernacle in Flesh</hi> among us.

thereof, and in Allusion thereto; and it may be as if our Lord had said, <hi>Would you know where the true Wells of Salvation are? 'Tis in me, that they are to be met withal: you must come to me for them.</hi> The Blessings which our Lord Jesus Christ has to bestow upon us, are here compared unto <hi>Water</hi>: and in his Inviting us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he seems to have some Eye unto the Form of Speaking, used by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of old, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that Thirsteth, come ye unto the Waters.</hi> But there is a most weighty <hi>Case</hi> which hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be considered; and that is,</p>
            <p>¶ After what manner ought we to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Invitations which the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in the Gospel gives us to come unto Him?</p>
            <p>I would now pray my Hearers, to <hi>Set their Hearts,</hi> unto the Things which I am going to speak; they are not <hi>Vain,</hi> or Light and Small Things; your <hi>Lives,</hi> yea, the <hi>Lives</hi> of your Never-Dying Souls, are as deeply concerned in these things, as in any that you were Ever Treated with.</p>
            <p n="1">I. There is a <hi>Thirsty,</hi> that is, a Distrest Condition of Soul, whereinto the Children of Men are brought, before they will come

unto the Lord Jesus Christ. We shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Comply with the Invitations of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>; until our Hearts have by an Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking work of the Law upon them, first been prepared for it: now that work of the <hi>Law</hi> do's raise a Mighty, and a Scalding <hi>Thirst,</hi> in the Souls of them that feel it. When Our Lord was Dying for us, He Cry'd out, I <hi>Thirst</hi>! and that must be our Cry, when we are Coming to Our Lord for the Good Effects of His Death.

them, our Lord says, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can you Believe?</hi> When our Lord Invites us to <hi>Come</hi> unto Him, He supposes that the Wrath of God has given a dreadful Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation unto our Souls; that we have seen the Eternal God Angry with us, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting <hi>Fire</hi> of His Indignation in the Fiery Vault below ready to fly up and break out upon us; that our Souls have been as it were set on a Light <hi>Fire,</hi> with hideous Apprehensions of the Sins which Ly upon us, and of the Wants and Woes which we are exposed unto.

            <p>'Tis requisite, <hi>Next,</hi> that we become Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of our <hi>Misery</hi> by our <hi>Emptiness.</hi> We are to count that our being without the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and without the <hi>Image,</hi> and without the <hi>Favour</hi> of God, <hi>is An intolerable thing.</hi> As the people could not bear it, when there happened unto them, that mischief, in Exod. 17.3. <hi>The People thirsted for water.</hi> So, when we think on the Calamities of our Souls, we should be able to say, <hi>Lord, I find my self not Able to Bear these Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> We are to be <hi>Filled</hi> with Bitter and Grievous Anxieties, when we think how <hi>Empty</hi> we are, of all manner of Good; and we are with <hi>pierced Hearts,</hi> to make that Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry in Act. 2.37. <hi>What shall we do?</hi>

            <p n="2">II. In Coming to our Lord Jesus Christ, we must seek and ask for the <hi>Whole</hi> of that <hi>Salvation,</hi> which He has to bestow upon us.

               <hi>III.</hi> Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is a thing that calleth for the <hi>Whole Soul,</hi> and all proper motions of the Soul, to be engaged in it. As in Praising of God, it is the Rule, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.1. <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me, Praise his Holy Name</hi>; so in coming to Christ, the same Rule is to be observed; <hi>It must be done with the whole Soul, and all that is within us.</hi> The mind, the will, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all the Powers of the Soul, are to be concerned in this <hi>Work of God.</hi> As now,</p>
            <p>First, It is with a certain <hi>Perswasion</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to come unto him. When we come unto the Lord
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000654_0087_0FA99F47ED66C1C8"/>
Jesus Christ, we must Firmly <hi>Believe</hi> all the Discoveries and Revelations, which God has given of him; and we should come to the Attainment of the Apostle, in 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 1 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him.</hi> We are to be well perswaded of the Excellent Qualities i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, and we are to be more than <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> that <hi>In Him there does all Fulness dwell.</hi> There are especially four perswasions which we are to Entertain, about our Lord Jesus Christ: or else we shall be <hi>Lame</hi> in our Coming unto Him. One is, <hi>That He is Able to Save unto the uttermost, all that Come unto God, by Him.</hi> A Second is, <hi>That there is none other Name under Heaven, given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, whereby we must be Saved.</hi> A Third is, <hi>That whosoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise Cast him out.</hi> A Fourth is, <hi>That he who Believeth, shall be Saved.</hi> All of these, must be Look'd upon as most <hi>Faithful Sayings</hi>; and we must be ready to venture all the Interests of our Immortal Souls upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is with a fervent <hi>Petition</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are to Come unto Him. The posture wherein we should come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, is upon our <hi>Knees:</hi> and we should present
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000654_0088_0FA99F48ABC95DA8"/>
our prayers before him, as did the leper, in <hi>Marc.</hi> 1.40. <hi>He came to him, Beseeching Him, and kneeling down to him.</hi> Tis in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Petitioners</hi>; yea, and of <hi>Poor</hi> ones too, that we are to <hi>sue</hi> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, when we come unto him. As a <hi>Beggar</hi> Petitions for an <hi>Alms,</hi> or, as a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner</hi> for his <hi>Life,</hi> so are we to Importune of our Lord Jesus Christ; that He would be concerned for our good. The Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which the miserable besought the healing miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the days of His flesh, are to be imitated in the Requests which we should make unto Him for our Souls. We are to intreat of Him, <hi>Lord, I am so Blind, that I cannot see the things of my Peace; Help this Blindness</hi>! We are to Entreat of Him, <hi>Lord, I am so Lame, that I cannot Run the Way of thy Commandments; Help this Lameness</hi>! We are to intreat, <hi>Lord, I have a Soul grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously vexed with the Divel; O cast this evil Spirit out.</hi> Yea, we are to entreat, <hi>Lord, I am Dead in Trespasses and sins; O thou that canst Raise the Dead, Make my Soul to Live</hi>! This is fitt Language to visit a Jesus</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We must come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, with a Lively <hi>Dependence</hi> on him. When we come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to Rely upon him for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of all that <hi>Blessedness,</hi> whereof
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000654_0089_0FA99F4A30204830"/>
He has encouraged our expectation. When we have commited all our Soul-concerns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are to make a conclusion like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that He <hi>will</hi> be so. We should now with a sweet Acquiescence of Soul, wait upon him, for <hi>Grace,</hi> for <hi>Glory,</hi> for <hi>every Good Thing.</hi> There is a certain <hi>Rest</hi> of Soul to be Endeavoured, as well as to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, in our Coming to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: the last <hi>Step</hi> of our <hi>Coming</hi> to Him, is accompanied with a <hi>Leaning</hi> on Him; and a saying, <hi>Why art thou disquieted within me, O my Soul! Hope in the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Compassionate Jesus; for He will bring thee unto the Praises of God for ever.</hi> Like the ancient Psalmist, having first with bitter strivings pleaded before the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver my Soul</hi>! then conclude, <hi>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul, for the Lord will deal bountifully with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:000654_0090_0FA99F4AEEAC41E8"/>IV. Being thoroughly Apprehensive, that we have no <hi>strength</hi> to <hi>come</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should first <hi>Cry</hi> for that Strength, and then <hi>Try</hi> whether we cannot come. As for us, we <hi>cannot</hi> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ; altho' our Precious and Immortal Souls do justly lie at the Stake, if we <hi>Do not come.</hi> And we never shall <hi>Come</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ aright, until we do with much anguish of Soul, see that we cannot <hi>come</hi> or <hi>stir</hi> towards Him. Nothing renders men more Incapable of a due <hi>Coming</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, than a vain and a proud <hi>Opinion</hi> of a <hi>Free will</hi> in themselves, of it self able to Do this <hi>Good Work</hi>; Or than forgetting, <hi>That in all Salvation-work, it is God who works in us, both to Will and to Do, of His own good pleasure.</hi> 'Tis very unlikely, That God should give us the <hi>Faith</hi> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, unless we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to that, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Faith is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</hi> It is not likely that God should bestow upon us the <hi>Power</hi> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without making us to own that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, according to the working of His mighty Power.</hi> It was hardly a stranger thing to see <hi>Peter</hi> walking on the Sea,, than to see a Sinner coming to the Lord Jesus Christ. O be sensible of this accursed <hi>Impotency</hi>! but at the same time see, that without the <hi>Grace</hi> of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000654_0091_0FA99F4BAC8E0568"/>
God we cannot so much as arrive to be thus far sensible. And yet there are two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Things from which we should not be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by discouraged.</p>
            <p>First, We are to <hi>Cry</hi> that God would help us to come. When we are advised of such a thing as that in <hi>John.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, Except the Father which hath sent me, Draw Him</hi>: It becomes us then humbly and warmly, to make that moan unto him, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.4. <hi>O Draw me</hi>! We cannot <hi>come</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, until we <hi>Turn</hi>; but how should we do <hi>That</hi>? That we may <hi>Turn,</hi> the way is to <hi>Cry</hi>; make that <hi>Cry,</hi> in Jer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</hi> O Ly before the Lord, and mourn before him, saying, <hi>Lord, I perish, and it is Just I should perish, if I do not come unto thee; but yet I cannot come; a Stone may as soon fly to Heaven, and become a Star in Heaven, as I of my self come to my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Lord; O do thou then Help me to come, and so Grace, Grace, will have all the Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; Now <hi>Try</hi> whether God will not help us to come Attempt, I say; See, as the well-disposed man, at length got so far as in Marc. 9.27. <hi>To say with Tears, Lord, I Believe, Help mine Unbelief!</hi> So, see whether you cannot say, <hi>Lord, now at Last I come! Lord, now at Last, I can trust my
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000654_0092_0FA99F4C6BBC9820"/>
Soul in thy Hands, for thee to make me Happy for ever.</hi> We find, that the man with a <hi>Withered Hand</hi> in Math. 12.13. when he <hi>Try'd,</hi> could <hi>Stretch</hi> it out; Even so, Let us <hi>Try,</hi> whether the <hi>Withered Foot</hi> of our Souls be not Cured by the <hi>Soveraign Grace</hi> of God; and whether we cannot come to what we never could of our selves come unto.</p>
            <p n="5">V. They that will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, must Answer and Conquer all the <hi>Objections</hi> of unbeleef, against coming to the Lord. You may be sure that when our Faces are once Christ-ward, many <hi>Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> will be cast before us, by <hi>An evil heart of unbeleef.</hi> But as the ways to the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> were Exactly and carefully cleared, among the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old, so must we do what we can to clear out of the way those things that might hinder us, in <hi>Flying for Refuge to the Hope set before us.</hi> As now,</p>
            <p>Tis one objection of unbeleef, <hi>Thy sins are so Extraordinarily Circumstanced, that if thou shouldest come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, it is Impossible thou shouldest be welcome unto that Holy Lord.</hi> Let our Answer to this objection, be, <hi>that</hi> in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Jesus Christ came into the world to Save sinners, of whom I am Chief.</hi> 'Tis for <hi>Sinners,</hi> that our Lord is become a <hi>Saviour; They</hi> are the <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k Ones,</hi> whom He is a <hi>Physician</hi> for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:000654_0093_0FA99F4DE9D336E0"/>
and the worse, the deeper, the older their <hi>Sickness</hi> is, the more will be His <hi>Glory</hi> in the Saving of them. Tho' we are <hi>Great Sinners,</hi> yet we may plead it with Him, that He is, <hi>A Great Saviour.</hi> 'Tis true, we have been <hi>Ready to sin</hi>; but it is said of God in Jesus Christ, <hi>Thou art Ready to Pardon.</hi> 'Tis true, we have <hi>sinned abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; but it is said of our Lord, <hi>He will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon.</hi> It was of old thrown upon Him as his Disgrace, <hi>He Receiveth Sinners</hi>; but it is his Honour, His Renown. His <hi>Blood,</hi> is, <hi>A Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness</hi>; the most polluted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among us all, may have Recourse to that <hi>Open Fountain.</hi> And, as long as we are not come to be such Apostates, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, and Persecutors, as to Hate the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, we may be sure that we are not fallen into the <hi>Unpardonable sin.</hi> Yea, if we are but <hi>Afraid</hi> of that Sin, 'tis a sign that we are not <hi>Fallen</hi> into it. He has already Received, not only to His <hi>Mercy,</hi> but also to His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> such as have been Guilty of the very same Sins, that now astonish our Consciences: He has Received a <hi>Menasseh</hi>; He has Received a <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> Is it the Sin of <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> that affrights us? Remember, By <hi>Faith</hi> Rahab <hi>the Harlot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished not.</hi> Is it the Sin of <hi>Thievery,</hi> that
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000654_0094_0FA99F4DF6DF35F0"/>
affrights us; Remember, The <hi>Thief on the Cross.</hi> Yea, Murder, and the <hi>Murder</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, did not put some out of Reach to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of that Blessed Lord.</p>
            <p>Tis Another objection of unbeleef, <hi>Thou art not so prepared for the Lord Jesus Christ, as that thou mayest without presumption dare to come unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this objection let us give <hi>that</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Lest him that is athirst, come, &amp; whosoever will, Let him take the water of Life Freely.</hi> What is the true <hi>End</hi> of all those <hi>Preparations</hi> that are undergone by the Elect of God, in their coming unto the Lord Jesus Christ? they are that we may be made <hi>willing</hi> to come. So then, if we do but find our selves <hi>willing</hi> to have the Lord Jesus Christ, we need not scruple our liberty to come unto him. Are we so affected with our <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ should be our <hi>Wisdom</hi>? Are we so concerned about our <hi>Guiltiness,</hi> as that we are willing to have <hi>Righteousness</hi> by our Lord Jesus Christ? Are we so troubled for our <hi>Pollutions,</hi> as to be willing that the Lord Jesus Christ, should be our <hi>Sanctification? Is</hi> our <hi>Captivity</hi> so Irksome to us, that we are willing to have <hi>Redemption</hi> by the Lord Jesus Christ? Then <hi>Come,</hi> in Gods Name; say not, <hi>Shall I?
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:000654_0095_0FA99F4EADC289E0"/>
May</hi> I? but, <hi>Come,</hi> without any further Hesitation. We must not imagine to come unto our Lord Jesus Christ, with any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation but that of our being <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miserable, and poor and blind and Naked.</hi> It is not under the Notion of <hi>prepared,</hi> but under the Notion of <hi>perishing</hi> Sinners, that we are to come unto Him. We would fain come unto Him <hi>with,</hi> such and such good Frames in our Souls; but we are to come unto Him <hi>for,</hi> what we cannot come unto Him <hi>with.</hi> Never stand pausing, whether you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone such Degrees of <hi>Compunction</hi> and <hi>Contrition</hi>; beware lest you make a <hi>Christ</hi> of those things; but if you <hi>can</hi> come, <hi>Do</hi>; or however <hi>Do</hi> what you <hi>can</hi> to come. Do not say, <hi>Lord, Depart from me, for I am sinful man</hi>; but say, <hi>Lord, because</hi> I <hi>am a sinful man, therefore</hi> I <hi>will come unto thee.</hi> Or argue at such a rate as the Lepers did, <hi>Be sure, if</hi> I <hi>sit still,</hi> I <hi>dy</hi>; I <hi>may go forth and live: If</hi> I <hi>stay from the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> I <hi>am ruined unavoidably; but</hi> I <hi>may come to Him, and have a good reception with Him: so this I'll do</hi>!</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Because we have hearts most unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably <hi>Lothe</hi> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we should lay before our selves all sit <hi>Incentives,</hi> to Provoke us, and Excite us thereunto. Tis <hi>Prodigious</hi>; but yet it is <hi>Notorious</hi>; There is nothing in the world
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:000654_0096_0FA99F4F6D925608"/>
whereto we are more Indisposed, than unto Believing unto the Lord Jesus Christ. Alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How often do we put our Lord, upon making that Lamentation over us, in Mat. 23.37. <hi>Ye would not!</hi> But it becomes us therefore to stir and spur up our own Souls, with very pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Thoughts upon this matter, till hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way to betake our selves but un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

No, shall I not.</hi> The Wise Man said, <hi>Of Labour there is Profit</hi>; but there is no <hi>Profit</hi> like that of this <hi>Labour.</hi> Let us come to our Lord; we shall find no mistake in that of the Psalmist, <hi>It is good for me to Draw near unto God</hi>! This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Lord Jesus Christ, is the most considerable Thing in that, <hi>Godliness which is profitable to all things.</hi> Come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately, the God of Heaven will say to you, <hi>Be of Good Chear, thy sins are forgiven thee</hi>!

            <p>Let our Third Consideration be, <hi>What will become of me, if</hi> I <hi>do not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ</hi>!

               <hi>State of Probation,</hi> which our God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for us; and that we may be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our <hi>Preparation</hi> for that GREAT WORLD, it is necessary that we should be furnished with some true Notions of it. But while we are <hi>Clothed</hi> with <hi>Flesh,</hi> the Notions of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Concerns, are most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conveyed unto us, by <hi>Metaphors</hi> fetch'd from such Objects, as do by our <hi>Flesh</hi> become sensible unto us; and the Beams of <hi>Light</hi> must come unto us from that <hi>Other World,</hi> with some <hi>Clothing</hi> from this upon them. Now Almighty God, Condescending in His Instructions to our Capacities, has been pleased Himself, to Intimate and as it were to Consecrate, certain <hi>Metaphors,</hi> for the use of our understandings, in shaping our Conceptions of such things as otherwise would be <hi>Unutterable,</hi> and He has pitched upon diverse things of common and famous use in Humane affairs, giving us this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon, <hi>Make those things the Figures from whence your Thoughts are to take their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, when you go to apprehend, the Deep things of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the Profound <hi>Mysteries,</hi> whereof our Merciful God has Mercifully advised us, One is, <hi>That Everlasting and Immutable Counsel of His, whereby He has Chosen a Certain and Special Number of Men, to be Vessels for the Glory of His Grace forever, with an Eternal Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation

passing over others.</hi> Now the Emblem or Shadow, under which our God would give us notice of this Glorious <hi>Mystery,</hi> is that of, A BOOK, wherein we may Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Entred, the Names of such as are to be Saved by the Lord Jesus Christ. Suppose a <hi>Daniel,</hi> a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>John</hi> might on this Side the Third Heaven, have enjoyed a <hi>Vision</hi> of the Eternal Election, passing upon the Heirs of <hi>Life,</hi> that Election would not have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than under the Shape and Form of, A BOOK, represented unto them. And the mention of A BOOK, in this case, may be supposed an allusion to the Publick <hi>Registers,</hi> used in Cities, Countreys, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and with almost all the Civilized Nations of this World; where the <hi>Names</hi> of such as might have any claim to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Priviledges, are usually Enrolled.

            <p>One Assertion is, That no man having His <hi>Name</hi> once written in the BOOK of Life, shall or can, ever have it <hi>Blotted</hi> out again.

                  </gap> have written,</hi> I <hi>have written</hi>: Much more will the Immortal God say, upon what He hath written in His Book about them
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:000654_0112_0FA99E866C646910"/>
that are to have <hi>Life,</hi> by the <hi>Death</hi> of our Lord, on that <hi>Cross, What I have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I have Written; and it shall never be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Least Obliteration.</hi> This was the Old <hi>Austins</hi> way of arguing.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Moses</hi> pleading for Sinful <hi>Israel,</hi> said, in Exod. 32.33. <hi>If thou wilt, Forgive their Sin, and if not, Blot me, I pray thee, out of this Book, which thou hast Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi> I Insist not on that which many, and especially Jewish Interpreters, assign as the meaning of those words; That they refer to the <hi>Book</hi> of the Law, or the Pentateuch, where the Name of <hi>Moses</hi> does <hi>Live</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned unto all Generations; <hi>q. d. I am willing it should never be Read or Known, that there was a man of my Name in the World.</hi> But it is possible, that the Man of God, might refer to the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life Temporal,</hi> not the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life Eternal</hi>; there is a <hi>Book of Providence,</hi> which has in it the Names of such as are to <hi>Out-Live</hi> the Wasting Plagues, that are to come upon their Neighbours; now says <hi>Moses, Let me rather now Dy my self, than that thy Name should be Dishonoured in thy Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

upon. But suppose that the <hi>Book</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was intended in the words of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; the Heroic Love and Zeal of that Saint, for the People of God, might pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately propound, an <hi>Impossible Thing,</hi> in the pursuance of a <hi>Possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, as to <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is indeed a <hi>Negative</hi> Deletion out of Gods Book, sometimes mentioned in the Oracles of God; but not, a <hi>Positive.</hi> When we Read such places, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.28. and Rev. 22.19. about mens being <hi>Blotted out of Gods Book,</hi> the meaning of it is, That God will make it appear, they have never been at all <hi>Written</hi> there.

afterwards to be Blotted out of the Glorious <hi>Last</hi> which the Decree of God has made of His Elect, <hi>this</hi> were a Tenet big with Many and Grievous Blasphemies. The Decree of God, indeed Orders a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Things, that are <hi>Conditionate,</hi> one unto another; but the Decree it self is not <hi>Conditionate</hi>; no, it absolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, as well the <hi>End,</hi> as all the <hi>Means</hi> Leading to that <hi>End.</hi> The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has Decreed, that such and such men, shall arrive unto Eternal Blessedness; of all whom, I may say, as <hi>Paul</hi> about some of them, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Their Names are in the Book of Life.</hi> But God has also De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that every one of these men shall certainly Repent, and certainly Believe, and in that way arrive to this Blessedness; nor can any one of these men, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in Impenitent Unbelief, procure his <hi>Name</hi> to be <hi>Blotted out of that Book.</hi> The old Pagans feigned their <hi>Graces,</hi> to be all of them Linked unto each other, by an <hi>Indissiluble Chain.</hi> But the Connexions between the <hi>Graces</hi> of our God, are still more Inseparable: you have them in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:30: <hi>Whom He did pred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000654_0115_0FA99E88ACE2E010"/>
Divine Election, is a Thing every where affirmed, by the Author of that Election; a thousand Scriptures conspire to tell us, <hi>That the purpose of God, according to Election shall stand.</hi> I Remember, that <hi>Solomon</hi> says, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.25. <hi>The Righteous is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Foundation.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this to all the <hi>Elect.</hi> They that have their Names <hi>Written in the Book of Life,</hi> have a two-fold <hi>Writing</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; One, <hi>The Lord knows who are his</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> T'other, <hi>Let every one that Names the Name of Christ depart from iniquity.</hi> Now for them that are thus written, tis said of <hi>Them,</hi> with Regard unto the <hi>writing</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. They are, first, a <hi>foundation</hi>; and, secondly, a <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God</hi>; and, Thirdly, a <hi>sure Foundation</hi>; and, Fourthly, a <hi>Foundation that stands</hi>; and Fifthly, a <hi>Foundation that has a Seal upon it</hi>; never shall the <hi>Writing</hi> of such a <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> be scratched out! The principle of <hi>Grace,</hi> which must be infused into all that have their Names in the <hi>Book,</hi>, is an <hi>immortal Seed</hi>; it <hi>Remains,</hi> it <hi>Abides,</hi> it is a <hi>Well of Water springing up into Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</hi> The Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> which all that have their Names in the <hi>Book</hi> must be brought into, is <hi>Everlasting,</hi> and <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>; the Lord not only says, I <hi>will not Break it</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also says, <hi>That He will keep us from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> so;</hi> He says, <hi>I we never Leave
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:000654_0116_0FA99E896E685730"/>
thee, nor Forsake thee.</hi> All that have their Names in the <hi>Book,</hi> shall be Married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Jesus Christ; but our Lord says, <hi>I hate putting away</hi>! The <hi>Power</hi> of God, and the <hi>Promise</hi> of God, is Engaged for, <hi>The Perseverance of the Saints</hi>; and the <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be Unsuccessful, and Insufficient, if any of them should not at last come to be, <hi>With Him, where He is</hi>!</p>
            <p>In short, If any Name could be Really Blotted out from the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> it must be, either, because that God knows not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly who will come unto <hi>Life Eternal</hi> at the last, or, because God could not confer the <hi>Grace,</hi> which is Necessary to bring them unto that <hi>Life.</hi> But, it is fit, that such <hi>Pelagian, Arminian, Socinian,</hi> Blasphemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Abominable among the People of God.</p>
            <p>But then, a Second Assertion is,</p>
            <p>That a man, having his <hi>Name</hi> written in the Book of Life, may by a Blessed <hi>Assurance</hi> of it, be able to <hi>Read</hi> it there. Our Lord, said once unto His Disciples, in Luc. 10.20: <hi>Rejoice, because your Names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; and this is one of those things whereto He would have that Rule applyed, <hi>What I say to you, I say to all.</hi> So then a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ on earth may with
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000654_0117_0FA99E8A41166970"/>
Joy unspeakable see his Name written, <hi>In Heaven,</hi> among them that, <hi>For Heaven,</hi> at the last. Why are we enjoyned, in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 10 <hi>Give Diligence to make your Election sure.</hi> 'Tis not a certainty of the <hi>Object,</hi> but a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Subject,</hi> that we are directed unto the pursuance of: A man by diligence in the Exercise of all vertue may come to be <hi>sure</hi> of this, <hi>I have my Name Written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Eternally Elected of God.</hi> The Inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable consequents of a <hi>Name written in the Book of Life, may</hi> be known by them, that have them. The <hi>Grace</hi> of God, wrought in the hearts of them that have their Names in the <hi>Book</hi> of God; this is a discernible sort of a Thing; tis compared unto <hi>Fire,</hi> unto <hi>Light,</hi> unto <hi>Life,</hi> which make themselves evident where they are. One Good man has before now been able to say, <hi>Lord, I believe.</hi> Another Good man has been able to say, <hi>Lord, thou knowest that I Love thee.</hi> Yea, but they that are assured of such Things, may readily tell, where their <hi>Names</hi> are to be found. Good men may come to say, as in 1: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 14. <hi>We know that we have passed from Death to Life</hi>; and this knowledge may assure them, that they have <hi>Names Written in the Book of Life.</hi> It was the assurance of a <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer lives.</hi> But such a man may be also assured, that his <hi>Redeemer</hi> has written him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000654_0118_0FA99E8BB59A6D68"/>
them that are to be <hi>Redeemed. It</hi> was the assurance of a <hi>David, The Lord is my Shepherd</hi>; but such a Man may be also assured, that the <hi>Great Shepherd</hi> has written him, among the sheep of his <hi>Right-Hand.</hi> It was the assurance of a <hi>Paul, The Son of God has loved me</hi>; but he was then likewise assured of a Room in the <hi>Book</hi> as well as in the <hi>Heart</hi> of that Blessed Lord.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to that most Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant CASE. What should a Man do, that he may be <hi>Assured</hi> of a Name, Written in the Book of <hi>LIFE</hi>?</p>
            <p>The Roman Historian Reports, that the Son of a Senator, understanding certain Honours to be decreed by the Senate for certain Souldiers, whose <hi>Names</hi> were for that cause written in a <hi>Book,</hi> he begg'd of his Father to let him see the <hi>Book,</hi> or to tell him at least, whether his <hi>Name</hi> were in the <hi>Book</hi>? His Father told him, <hi>These were Secrets</hi>; whereupon the Son ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pray, Sir, tell me the General Qualifications of them, that have their Names in the Book,</hi> which when the Father did, the Son per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himself to be none of them. Truly,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000654_0119_0FA99E8C6E051120"/>
               <hi>The Book of Life,</hi> is One of the, <hi>Secret Things which belong unto the Lord</hi>; it were a vain and a mad curiosity, to think of Climbing Heaven for a view of <hi>That</hi>; we may say of it, <hi>I cannot Read, for lo, the Book is a sealed Book</hi>; but the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of them that may know their <hi>Names</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that Book, These are the <hi>Revealed Things, which belong unto us, and unto our Children.</hi> Attend, then, while I set <hi>Them</hi> a little before you; Attend, while I show you, what is like to become of you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eternal Ages.</p>
            <p n="1">I. If a man would be Assured of a Name in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> Let him then make sure of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and of a <hi>New Life.</hi> In Well Ordered Common-wealths, all that are <hi>Born</hi>

Well, All of these Children have their Names also, in, <hi>A Book of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Jesus Christ.</hi> God had His Books of <hi>Genealogies</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> from which they that could not prove their Birth of such or such Parents, were put by from the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of the Lord. Yea, but it is a <hi>New-Birth</hi> alone, which will help us to find our Names in Gods Book of <hi>Genealogies.</hi> There were <hi>Foolish Questions about Genealogies,</hi> ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in the Schools of the old Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Philosophers; the Apostle has <hi>Hissed</hi> at those <hi>Questions</hi>: but it is no <hi>Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Question,</hi> for a man to be Inquisitive after this <hi>Genealogy, Am</hi> I <hi>Born again? or No?</hi> The man that is <hi>Born from Above,</hi> may be sure that he has <hi>his Name written Above.</hi> We read of, A <hi>New Name.</hi> Thy Name was, <hi>A Child of Wrath</hi>; but is thy Name now, <hi>A Child of God</hi>?

Behold, with a Joyful Soul, Thy <hi>Name</hi> is written in this <hi>Book.</hi> It was a dreadful Imprecation upon the <hi>Despisers</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, in Psal. 69.28. <hi>Let them be Blotted out of the Book of the Living, and not be Written with the Righteous.</hi> Tremble at this, all you that have been so busy about the Trifles of this World, as hitherto to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>Christless</hi> all your Days.

            <p n="5">V. He that belongs to the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, may be certain that His <hi>Name</hi> is written in the <hi>Mysterious Book</hi> of that Lord. The Spirit of our Lord, in <hi>David,</hi> having an eye to his Mystical <hi>Body,</hi> saith in <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.16. <hi>In thy Book, all my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were written.</hi> When once a man becomes really Joined unto that <hi>Body</hi> even, the whole <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> he may then Venture to think, <hi>I am certainly one of those that were in the Book of God, from all Eternity, Laid out for the Members of Christ Mystical.</hi> Yea, But how shall a man know that he belongs to the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ? I'll tell you, <hi>How</hi>? Are you Acted by the same <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, that
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:000654_0128_0FA99E93ED06AC20"/>
Actuates all the Rest of His Body? Is the the Lord Jesus Christ a <hi>Quickning Spirit</hi> unto <hi>you,</hi> as He is unto the Rest of them, that are United unto Himself? We read of <hi>Names Written in the Earth</hi>; so 'tis, When we have <hi>Hearts cleaving to the Earth.</hi> Some there are, that never think, they have <hi>Earth</hi> enough, and that subordinate all things to the getting of <hi>Earth.</hi> Such men are strangers to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ; God knows, whether they have <hi>Names Written in Heaven,</hi> or no. But pray, mark what I say; the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, Inclines all that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, To prefer a Christ above a World; and to abhor and avoid every <hi>Sin,</hi> as the worst Evil in the World; It inclines them all, to prize <hi>Communion</hi> with God, in the Devotions of Christianity, above all the Delights of this Life: It inclines them all, to do all the Good they can, unto all that are about them. Say now, Are you Led by this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of the Lord, or no? If you are, Then I say, That you are in the <hi>Holy Body</hi> of the Lord. Let me add, How are you concerned for the <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ? Are the <hi>Joyes</hi> of the Church, made your own; Are the <hi>Griefs</hi> of the Church made your own: Do you Resent the Circumstances of the Church, <hi>As being your selves also in the Body?</hi> Behold, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

Demonstration that you are <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Body.</hi> But if you will do something further to put it out of doubt; pray, Joyn your selves in <hi>Fellowship,</hi> with a particular <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, walking in the Order of the Gospel. The Apostle speaks in Heb. 12.23. about, <hi>The General Assembly, and the Church of the First born, which are Written in Heaven.</hi> 'Tis in allusion to the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> Assembled at <hi>Sinai</hi> of old. This I say, if men would not remain in Doubts, whether they be <hi>Written in Heaven.</hi> Let them get into some <hi>Assembly of Zion,</hi> some Church of the Living God. We read in Isa. 4.3. about some, <hi>Written among the Living in Jerusalem.</hi> If any man, don't count it worth the while, for him to have his <hi>Name,</hi> Written in the <hi>Church-Book,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are anew made <hi>Alive</hi> by the Word of God, how should he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to see his <hi>Name</hi> written in <hi>Gods Book,</hi> among them that are to <hi>Live</hi> Eternally? I am verily perswaded, That God thus punishes the fault of many a Christian, who Lies from year to year out of <hi>Church Fellowship</hi>; He punisheth it, by denying them an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of an Interest, in the <hi>Book of Life.</hi>

Thus in the <hi>Salvation</hi> of a Sinner, the Work of <hi>Contriving</hi> that Salvation, belongs to God the <hi>Father</hi>; the Work of <hi>Effecting</hi> it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God the <hi>Son</hi>; But the Work of <hi>Applying</hi> it, belongs to God the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And thence the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Sinners is that in which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> has a special In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.

them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets</hi>; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God sends <hi>Prophets,</hi> Ministers, Messengers, with which he takes pains about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of ungodly men. The Prophet <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> could say, in Isa: 48.16. <hi>The Lord God,</hi> and His Spirit <hi>hath sent me</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why, when the Embassadors of God, <hi>are beeseeching of men to be Reconciled unto him,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>the Lord God</hi> himself, accompanys them, in their Embassages and in those Beseechings. Again by the <hi>Providences</hi> of God there are Endeavours of the Holy Spirit for our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Good. The <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, those are the things with which the Holy Spirit is <hi>drawing</hi> us to Christ; it is in them, that the Spirit of God may say, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>With Loving Kindness have I drawn thee.</hi> The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Spirit in every mercy is, <hi>O Fear the Lord and His Goodness!</hi> and, <hi>O let the Goodness of God Lead thee to Repentance!</hi> The <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, these are the Things, with which the <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit is <hi>driving</hi> us from Sin; for Them we may acknowledge to the Spirit of God, as in <hi>Job</hi> 10.2. <hi>Thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest with me.</hi> As the <hi>Rod</hi> has a <hi>voice,</hi> thus there is in every Judgment that voice of the Spirit, <hi>O Learn Righteousness</hi>! and, <hi>O see what an Evil and a Bitter Thing it is to Forsake thy God</hi>! In the Hand of the Spirit, <hi>Mercies</hi> do oblige, <hi>Judgments</hi> do demand our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Lord.</p>

                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:000654_0148_0FA99EA52C7180A0"/>Secondly, There are <hi>Internal Endeavours</hi> used also by the Spirit of God for the Conversion of Men. And these are of two sorts.</p>
               <p>First, the Holy Spirit attempts the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of men by <hi>Informing</hi> of them. He En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens them, and by their <hi>Illumination,</hi> they are made <hi>Partakers of the Holy Ghost.</hi> We are told, 1 Cor. 12.3. <hi>No man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Holy Spirit perswades many a man, That the Lord Jesus is the <hi>Wonderful Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> without whom, <hi>There is no Name given, whereby we may be Saved</hi>; The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> Enables many a man to <hi>Understand</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain</hi> the Fundamental Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thereby He makes their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appear to be, as it is indeed, an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Thing before them. 'Tis said of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.18. <hi>He shall convince the World.</hi> He convinces them, that they have grievously <hi>sinned,</hi> and plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into innumerable <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Woes,</hi> by doing so; He convinces them, that a precious <hi>Christ,</hi> embraced by a penitent <hi>Faith,</hi> is the <hi>One Thing Needful</hi>; How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten does He Convince men, That there is a God, in whose <hi>Favour is Life,</hi>; that there is a <hi>Jesus,</hi> who <hi>delivers from the Wrath to come</hi>; that they must Rely upon the Lord Christ for <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000654_0149_0FA99EA5F0316700"/>
                  <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> if they would be made partakers of true Blessedness? And this is that he may <hi>Convert the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly The Holy Spirit attempts the Conversion of men by <hi>Affecting of them.</hi> And there are three things, which the Spirit of God affects many men into, when He is making <hi>Essays</hi> towards the Converting of them.</p>
               <p>First, There are dismal <hi>Terrours</hi> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men. He terrifies them with hideous Visions of their own <hi>Wretchedness</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi>: and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ightens them with a just Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if they continue as they are, <hi>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> We read in Rom. 8.15. about the <hi>Spirit of bondage unto fear.</hi> The Spirit of God makes many a man see himself <hi>bound</hi> over to endure the <hi>Fearful</hi> and Fiery Wrath of God for ever; He enkindles in them a <hi>Fear,</hi> that He is <hi>angry with them every day,</hi> and that He will <hi>break them sore in the place of Dragons at the Last Day.</hi> Thus the Spirit made <hi>Faelix</hi> to <hi>tremble,</hi> in the Fore-bodings of a <hi>Judgment to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There are serious <hi>Desires,</hi> which the Spirit of God often causes in unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men. He inflames warm desires in them after the <hi>Things of their Peace:</hi> and raises

in them some Longings after <hi>Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in heavenly matters in Christ Jesus.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, that made the Jews cry out, Joh. 6.35. Lord, <hi>give us evermore the Bread of Life.</hi> The Spirit of God makes many a man desirous, O <hi>that my sin were pardoned</hi>! and, <hi>O that my heart were mollified</hi>! and, <hi>O that my Soul were bound up in the Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are Devout <hi>Resolves,</hi> which the Spirit of God often causes in Unconverted men. He fills them with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves,</hi> to <hi>break off their sins by Righteousness</hi>: and with many purposes and intentions, that they will walk at <hi>Peradventures</hi> with God no more. 'Twas the Spirit of God that procured such an Inclination as that in them of old, Jer. 2.10. <hi>Thou sayest</hi> I <hi>will not transgress.</hi> The Spirit of God puts many upon such Resolutions, <hi>I have done Iniquity, but I</hi> will <hi>do so no more.</hi> The <hi>Vows</hi> men make, when a Dreadful Eternity is before their eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Sick-bed Vows, and Sea-storm Vows and the Vows which they make when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress and Anguish is upon them, these are often excited by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God.

                  <hi>Proposition,</hi> III.</head>
               <p>Multitudes of wretched sinners <hi>Resist</hi> the <hi>Methods</hi> used by the Holy Spirit for the Conversion of their Souls; and in so doing they <hi>Resist the Holy Ghost.</hi> But how is this done? The Greek word here <hi>to Resist</hi> signifies <hi>To throw something in the way,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Passage</hi> or <hi>Journey</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The Spirit of God is in the <hi>way</hi> of Converting many a man, but the mad sinner will throw, something or other in the <hi>way</hi> of the Holy Spirit, so that He makes a stop, a stand, He goes no further in it; This 'tis to <hi>Resist the Holy Ghost.</hi> Particularly;</p>
               <p>First, Unconverted Sinners, <hi>Resist</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God by <hi>Diversion</hi>; when the Spirit of God would be <hi>Renewing</hi> of them, they throw some <hi>Diversion</hi> in his Way. Perhaps this Holy Spirit cannot come at them, because of their <hi>Business.</hi> When the Spirit would have been Recovering of wicked <hi>Cain</hi> from his forlorn estate, we find in Gen. 4.17. He went away to <hi>building of Cities.</hi> Men so get and keep in the clattering noise of the <hi>world</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:000654_0152_0FA99EA831ADC218"/>
they always find something to do, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Thousand Hurries for themselves: Hence the Spirit of God never finds them at leisure enough, to do any thing upon them. Or, the Holy Spirit cannot come at them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their <hi>Company.</hi> 'Tis said of bad <hi>Companions,</hi> in Prov. 5.9, <hi>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of Life,</hi> their <hi>ways are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.</hi> Even so, least the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God should make men begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, Unconverted men <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit of God by <hi>Denial.</hi> When the Spirit of God would be <hi>Renewing</hi> of them, they do throw a <hi>Positive Denial</hi> in his way, and so they send him away sorrowful. Their Impiety, is that in Job 21:14: <hi>They say to God depart from us, for we desire not the knowledg of thy ways.</hi> They say unto the Spirit of God <hi>Be gone, we desire not the happiness, which thou dost offer to us</hi>! They say unto him, <hi>Be gone, we desire not the Holiness, which thou dost a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

word thou hast spoken to us, we</hi> will <hi>not hearken to thee.</hi> Thus the Spirit of God saies, <hi>Pray in thy Family, Pray in thy Retirement</hi>: but lewd men say, <hi>No, we</hi> will <hi>not</hi>! The Spirt of God saies, <hi>Bind thy self by an Holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto the service of the Lord</hi>; but wild men say, <hi>No, we</hi> will <hi>not</hi>! The Spirit of God entreats, <hi>O do not the Abominable things which</hi> I <hi>hate!</hi> But there are extravagant men that say, <hi>We will do them every day!</hi> The Spirit of God now goes away grieved at this Cursed Obstinacy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unconverted men <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit of God by affronting, and abusing those in whom it is. Compare our Text with what follows, and you find things thus expressed. Mens <hi>Resisting of the Holy Ghost,</hi> is explained by their <hi>Persecuting</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>: truly, to <hi>Persecute</hi> the Ministers of the Gospel, who are <hi>Ministers of the Spirit</hi>; this is to <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit Himself. To scoff, or starve, or slay those men, whom the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> hath made His <hi>Trumpets</hi> or His <hi>Temples,</hi> 'tis to <hi>Resist</hi> Him: So likewise to despise or oppose and suppress the Means of Grace, in which are the <hi>Demonstration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> this is to <hi>Resist</hi> Him. Tis to throw <hi>Malignity</hi> in His way.</p>

                  <hi>Proposition</hi> IV.</head>
               <p>This <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, is that which confirms men in their impenitent unbelief. And this there is too doleful <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> for.</p>
               <p>The Reason of it is, in short thus much; The <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit proves the <hi>withdrawing of that Spirit:</hi> He saies in Gen: 6:3. <hi>My Spirit shall not always strive</hi>; And if the Spirit shall cease to <hi>strive,</hi> the Sinner will never begin to <hi>turn.</hi> The Rule, the Old Rule, about the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> is too sadly verified in the motions of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> if you <hi>Resist him he will Flee from you.</hi> The <hi>Dove</hi> will not care to tarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, where no good entertainment is ever like to be afforded Him. Indeed the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> gives no bar to his converting of them, who may be <hi>Resisting</hi> of Him; He <hi>can</hi> if he <hi>will</hi> proceed and conquer the most obdurate <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> in the World; He can cause the most obdurate <hi>Resistance</hi> to give way before Almighty Arm. But it is the <hi>Justice</hi> of the Holy Spirit that Countenances this order of things; when Men <hi>Resist</hi> the Spirit of God it is but <hi>just</hi> with him to <hi>desert</hi> them. It is but <hi>just</hi> if men <hi>resist</hi> him, that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve concerning them, I <hi>will ease me of those

Without the Efficacy of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> no Conversion is to be hoped for; but when He is long <hi>Resisted,</hi> he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds that Efficacy, and instead of <hi>Conversion</hi> there now ensues a nothing but a deplorable and Everlasting <hi>Confusion</hi> in the Soul.</p>
               <p>Particularly,</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>External</hi> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will cease upon our long <hi>Resisting</hi> of Him.

this also, that his Providence will no more be concerned for us. Many a man, once had the <hi>Light of God shining upon his Tabernacle,</hi> but now every thing brings a Cross with it, and he may say, <hi>All things are against me.</hi> 'Tis because the Spirit of God speaking to him in his <hi>Prosperity</hi> hath been <hi>resisted</hi>; even for that cause now it is with him as in Ez: 7.26. <hi>Mischief shall come upon Mischief.</hi> On the other side, many a man had <hi>his way so hedged up with thorns,</hi> that he could not sin so easily, as else he would have done; but how God has done afflicting and restraining of him. Why? He <hi>Resisted</hi> the Spirit of God speaking to him in his <hi>Adversity</hi>; and now the Lord saies as in Hos. 7.14: <hi>He is joined to</hi> Idols, <hi>Let him alone</hi>: One of the Ancients upon that Scripture says, <hi>Vis Indignantis Dei terribilem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem audire?</hi> Tis the terriblest Thunder of a Provoked and Revenging God!</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Internal</hi> Methods of the Holy Spirit for our Conversion will also cease upon our long <hi>Resisting</hi> of Him. It was said of <hi>Saul,</hi> wretched <hi>Saul,</hi> in 1 Sam. 16.14. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord, departed from him.</hi> It was again s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet more particularly,</p>
               <p>First, A <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <hi>Penal Blindness</hi> of Mind. It was the heavy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, upon some in <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.18. <hi>He hath shut their eyes, they cannot see.</hi> The Spirit of God may so leave us, upon <hi>Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> that no <hi>Heresy,</hi> no <hi>Blasphemy</hi> shall come amiss unto us, but we shall swallow down very damnable <hi>Delusions</hi> as the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God. Perhaps all the Monsters of <hi>Quakerism</hi> or of <hi>Popery,</hi> or any other Disguised <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> shall Recommend themselves unto us, as the most beautiful <hi>Mysteries of Godliness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, A <hi>Resisting</hi> of the Holy Spirit, will provoke Him to leave us unto a <hi>Paenal Hardness</hi> of Heart. As it was of old said in Exod. 10.27. <hi>The Lord hardened the Heart of Pharoah</hi>; Upon <hi>Resistance</hi> the Spirit of God will so leave us, that nothing shall <hi>melt us,</hi> nothing shall <hi>fright</hi> us, no calls, no crys, no counsels will cause us to turn from our <hi>Evil Ways</hi>; our hearts will be like the <hi>Nether

'Tis indeed, the case, the crime of all you, that never yet were <hi>Converted</hi> unto God. I believe there is hardly a Child of Twelve Years Old among us, which the Spirit of God has not been in some sort working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in the Name of God, what is come of it?

                  <p>The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God is, at this very day, using his <hi>Methods</hi> for the converting of your Souls.

The crys of the Holy Spirit in your ears are those in Ruth 1.16. <hi>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee.</hi> Have you not <hi>Outward Offers</hi> of the Gospel made unto you? at this very instant you have them. We read in Rev. 22.15. <hi>The Spirit saith come, and whosoever will let him come, and take of the Waters of Life freely.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God that is now urging of you, <hi>To turn and live.</hi> You are now called upon, <hi>O come and give yourselves to the Son of God</hi>!

You have a word <hi>within</hi> you, saying, <hi>O let not matters between your God, and your Soul, any more lye at uncertainties</hi>! 'Tis the Holy Spirit of God that is in this <hi>Word within you.</hi> These <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies</hi> are from that Holy Spirit.

Holy Spirit of God, that you may fear, a little <hi>Resistence</hi> more may cause the Eternal Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his influences from your Souls. Methinks I overhear the Holy Spirit of God saying to some of us, <hi>Be instructed, poor soul, be instructed quickly, lest I depart from thee, and thou become desolate for evermore.</hi> There are Souls whose <hi>Time</hi> is almost our, whose <hi>Glass</hi> is almost Run; the <hi>Inch of Candle</hi> is come just to the bottom with them; If they dont, presently, make a Good <hi>Bargain</hi> for Eternal Happiness, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily perish in the <hi>dark.</hi> But, who are they?
