            <head>SEWING MACHINES.</head>
            <p>The following article, which is copied from the <title>New York Tribune</title> of
the 27th of November, gives a description of the various Sewing Machines
in existence, and accords to Dr. Avery's machine the preference over all
others:</p>
            <p>"Tailors and seamstresses contend that the sewing done by machinery is
not substantial. We think this is an erroneous opinion. It seems to us,
on careful examination, to be as strong and durable as is necessary; moreover,
it is done more evenly and regularly than by hand.</p>
            <p>"We have examined six Sewing Machines, viz:
<list type="simple">
                  <item>"1. That of Elias Howe, jr., patented September, 1846, sold for $125.</item>
                  <item>"2. That of I. M. Singer, sold for $125.</item>
                  <item>"3. That of A. B. Wilson, patented November, 1850.</item>
                  <item>"4. That of J. M. Magnin—a French invention.</item>
                  <item>"5. That of Morey &amp; Johnson, of Massachusetts.</item>
                  <item>"6. That of Dr. Otis Avery, patented October, 1852, sold for $25. [Sold
by Charles Nettleton, 251 Broadway, New York.]</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>"Mr. Howe's is the first practical Sewing Machine invented; he
considers that the others infringe upon his patent, and threatens to sue their
purchasers accordingly. He uses two threads, and an accurate idea of his
seam will be formed by twisting two threads together, and imagining them
so disposed as that the point where they cross each other is always in the
cloth—one of them forming the visible portion of the stitch on one side, and
the other on the other. The machines of Singer, Wilson, and Morey &amp;
Johnston, use needles of a kind different from Howe's, but produce the same stitch
as his. Of these four, all are equally correct and good in respect to mechanical
principles; but, as they differ widely in many particulars—one being
vertical, and another horizontal; one carrying its own cloth, and another
requiring that it should be carried by hand—actual trial can only decide
which is the best for practical use; and such a trial we have not had the
opportunity of witnessing. We have, however, seen shirts, pantaloons,
coats, and Morocco shoes, made by them, and have thoroughly tried the
strength of the seams, and have found them satisfactory. In most if not all
cases, the material would give way and tear, but the sewing would not rip.
The perfect regularity of the stitches made by these machines renders them
very useful for fancy work like shirt-bosoms. For an inch of seam, three
inches of thread are used. A person with a machine will do from five to
ten times as much work as with the needle. In several large shops they
are used, and many persons wear garments made by them, without a
suspicion of the fact.</p>
            <p>Magnin's machine operates with a single thread, and produces what is
known as the tambour stitch. It may do you for embroidery and has oven
been arranged with several needles, and used for that purpose, but it is
worth nothing for sewing. Its principal defects are, that when one stitch
is broken, the whole seam will unravel; that it requires eight inches of
thread for every inch of sewing; and that in fancy work it gives different
results on the two sides of cloth.</p>
            <p>Dr. Avery's machine, exhibited here at the Fair of the American Institute,
is completely original—its features and arrangements not being
borrowed from those of other inventors. It operates with two needles and two
threads, which it interlocks in something like a tambour stitch. We have
examined its work with great care, and have cut every other stitch on one
side of the cloth, and still have found the seam quite as strong as any other,
having none of the defects of the ordinary tambour stitch. It uses more,
thread than either of the other American machines, but less than the French.
In respect to rapidity of work, we think there is no great difference. The
great advantages of Avery's machine are its more simple mechanism and
its great cheapness. For household use, these are of great importance. In
respect to price, we judge that the machines now sold for $125 will have
to come down very considerably before they are extensively adopted by
the community.—<title>New York Tribune</title>.</p>

            <head>THE AMERICAN PHRENOLOGICAL JOURNAL.</head>
            <head type="sub">PROSPECTUS FOR VOL. XVII. FOR 1853.</head>
            <p>PHRENOLOGY, the science of MIND, includes in its wide domain a knowledge of all
the faculties, passions, and powers of the HUMAN SOUL: all the bodily organism over
which the soul presides, with its structure and functions; and all the realm of
nature to which man is related, and with which he should live in harmony. It
includes a knowledge of man and his relations to God and to the Universe. It is
thus a central and comprehensive science, beginning with the CONSTITUTION OF MAN,
and ending with all his possible relations, SPIRITUAL and MATERIAL. It is thus that
SELF-KNOWLEDGE is the basis of all knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE PHRENOLOGICAL JOURNAL, therefore, has a sphere that is universal. All
philosophy, all science, all art, all the details of practical life, are legitimate subjects of
discussion in its columns. From this vast field we aim to select the most important,
useful and interesting matters.</p>
            <p>We shall illustrate the varieties of cerebral development by spirited and truthful
engravings of striking specimens of Human Nature, in its highest, and lowest, its
harmonious and discordant, its symmetrical and grotesque developments.</p>
            <p>PSYCHOLOGY, OR THE SCIENCE OF THE SOUL, vague as it now is in its terms, uncertain
in its facts, and indefinite in its conclusions, must still be to every inquiring mind
a subject of intense interest. This subject will be carefully examined.</p>
            <p>YOUNG MEN about launching forth upon the activities of life, and anxious to start
right, and understand their course, will find the Journal a friend and monitor, to
encourage them to virtue, shield them from vice, and to prepare them for usefulness
and success in life. The various occupations will be discussed in the light of
Phrenology and Physiology, so that every one may know in what pursuit he would
be most likely to succeed.</p>
            <p>THE NATURAL SCIENCES, Art, Literature, Mechanism, Agriculture, and General
Intelligence, will constitute an essential feature for 1853.</p>
            <p>THE MECHANIC, the Farmer, the Professional Man, the Student, the Teacher, and
the Parent, will find each number of the Journal an instructive and valuable
companion.</p>
            <p>THE PHRENOLOGICAL JOURNAL is published on the first of every month, in quarto
form, suitable for binding, amply illustrated with engravings, at ONE DOLLAR A
YEAR, in advance, by FOWLERS and WELLS, Clinton Hall, 131 Nassau Street, New
York.</p>
            <p>"This excellent Journal is doing more to benefit mankind than all the gold-diggers
in the two hemispheres. It is only One Dollar per year, and is worth ten times
that in any family."—<title>Cleveland Commercial</title>.</p>
            <p>FOWLERS AND WELLS have all works on Phrenology, Physiology,
Hydropathy, Phonography, and the Natural Sciences generally. AGENTS WANTED in
every County.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>OUR generous friends in Georgia and South Carolina will
not add among their assumptions that we know nothing of
the South and Southern life. A residence of several years
in those States, a connection with the press, and associations
in public life, gave us opportunities which we did not lose,
and have not lost sight of; and if we dipped deeper into the
vicissitudes of life and law than they gave us credit for at the
time, we trust they will pardon us, on the ground of interest
in the welfare of the South.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we should say, to support the true interests of the
South, we should and must abandon many of those <emph>errors</emph> we
so strenuously supported in years past; and thus we have
taken up the subject of our book, based upon the practical
workings of an infamous law, which we witnessed upon the
individual whose name forms a part of the title.</p>
            <p>Imprisoning a shipwrecked sailor, and making it a penal
offence for a freeman to come within the limits of a republican
State, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, seems to be
considered commonplace, instead of barbarous in South
Carolina. This may be accounted for by the fact that the
power of a minority, created in wrong, requiring barbarous
expedients to preserve itself intact, becomes an habitual
sentiment, which usage makes right.</p>
            <p>This subject has been treated with indifference, even by
the press, which has satisfied itself in discussing the abstract
right as a question of law, rather than by disclosing the <orig>suf-</orig>
               <pb n="4"/>
ferings of those who endure the wrong and injustice. When
we are called upon to support, and are made to suffer the
penalty of laws founded in domestic fear, and made subservient
to various grades of injustice, it becomes our duty to
localize the wrong, and to point out the odium which attaches
to the State that enacts such laws of oppression.</p>
            <p>A "peculiar-institution" absorbs and takes precedence of
every thing; its protection has become a sacred element of
legislative and private action; and fair discussion is looked
upon as ominous, and proclaimed as incendiary. But we
speak for those who owe no allegiance to that delicate
institution; citizens to all intents and, purposes (notwithstanding
their dark skins) of the countries to which they severally
belong; peaceable persons, pursuing their avocations, to
provide a respectable maintenance for their families, and worthy
of the same protective rights claimed by the more fortunate
citizens of such countries. In doing this we shall give a
practical illustration of the imprisonment of four individuals
in South Carolina, and ask those who speculate in the abstract
science of State sovereignty, to reflect upon the issue of that
lamentable injustice which inflicts punishment upon persons
guiltless of crime. We prefer to be plain, and we know our
Southern friends will not accuse us of misconstruction, for we
have their interests at heart, as well as the cause of humanity,
which we shall strive to promote, in spite of the struggles of
modern barbarism, seeking to perpetuate itself. Fear, the
inventor of such pretexts as are set up, and mantled in
Southern modesty, must remodel its code for South Carolinians,
before it can assert a power unknown to law, or
trample upon the obligations of treaty, or enforce nullification
of individual rights.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE UNLUCKY SHIP.</head>
            <p>THE British brig Janson, Thompson, master, laden
with sugar, pimento, &amp;c. &amp;c. left Kingston, Jamaica,
in the early part of March, in the present year,
bound for Glasgow. The skipper, who was a genuine
son of the "Land o' Cakes," concluded to take the
inside passage, and run through the gulf. This
might have been questioned by seamen better
acquainted with the windward passage; but as every
Scotchman likes to have his own way, the advice of
the first officer—an experienced salt in the West
India waters—went to leeward. On rounding Cape
Antoine, it was evident that a strong blow was
approaching. The clouds hung their dark curtains in
threatening blackness; and, as the sharp flashes of
lightning inflamed the gloomy scene, the little bark
seemed like a speck upon the bosom of the sea. It
was the first mate's watch on deck. The wind, then
blowing from the W.S.W., began to increase and
veer into the westward; from whence it suddenly
chopped into the northward. The mate paced the<pb n="6"/>
quarter wrapt in his fearnought jacket, and at every
turn giving a glance aloft, then looking at the
compass, and again to the man at the wheel, as if he had
an instinct of what was coming.</p>
            <p>He was a fearless navigator, yet, like many others
who had yielded to the force of habit, was deeply
imbued with that prevalent superstition so common
to sailors, which regards a particular ship as unlucky.
Imagine an old-fashioned boatswain, with north-country
features strongly marked, a weather-beaten
face, and a painted south-wester on his head, and you
have the <hi>"Mister Mate"</hi> of the old brig Janson.</p>
            <p>"Keep her full, my hearty. We must take in our
light sails and go on the other tack soon. If we
don't catch it before daylight, I'll miss my calculation.
She's an unlucky old craft as ever I sailed in,
and if the skipper a'n't mighty careful, he'll never
get her across. I've sworn against sailing in her
several times, but if I get across in her this time, I'll
bid her good-by; and if the owners don't give me a
new craft, they may get somebody else. We're just
as sure to have bad luck as if we had cats and
parsons aboard."</p>
            <p>Thus saying, he descended the companion-way,
and reported the appearance of the weather to the
skipper, who arose quickly, and, consulting his
barometer, found it had fallen to near the lowest scale.
After inquiring the quarter of the wind, and how she
headed, what sail she was carrying, and the probable
distance from the cape, he gave orders to call all
hands to take in the topgallant-sails, double reef the
fore, and single reef the maintop-sails, and stow the
flying-jib—dressed himself, and came on deck.
Just as he put his head above the slide of the <orig>com-</orig>
               <pb n="7"/>
panion, and stopped for a minute with his hands
resting upon the sides, a vivid flash of lightning hung
its festoons of fire around the rigging, giving it the
appearance of a chain of livid flame.</p>
            <p>"We'll catch the but-end of a gulf sneezer soon.
Tell the boys to bear a hand with them sails. We
must get her snug, and stand by to lay her under a
double-reefed maintop-sail and jib, with her head to
the northward and eastward. We may make a clear
drift—chance if it lasts long," said Skipper Thompson,
as he stood surveying the horizon and his craft.
Scarcely had he given the orders before the storm
burst upon them with all its fury. Its suddenness
can only be appreciated by those who have sailed in
the West India passages, where the sudden shocks
of the short-chopping sea acts with a tremendous
strain upon the hull of a heavy-laden vessel. The
captain ran to the windward gangway, hurrying his
men in the discharge of their duty, and giving another
order to clew up the coursers and foretop-sail. Just
as the men had executed the first, and were about to
pull on the clew-lines of the latter, a sudden gust
took effect upon the bag of the sail and carried it
clean from the bolt-ropes. The halyards were
lowered and the yards properly braced up, while the
Janson was brought to under the canvas we have before
described. In a few minutes more the wind had
increased to a gale, and, as the sailors say, several
times the old craft "wouldn't look at it." Several
times we had to put her helm up, and as many times
she shipped those forcing cross seas which drive
every thing before them, and sweep the decks. At
length a piece of canvas was lashed to the fore-rigging
which gave her a balance, and she rode easy until<pb n="8"/>
about five o'clock in the morning, when by a sudden
broach the canvas was carried away, and a tremendous
sharp sea boarded her forward; starting several
stanchions, carrying away part of her starboard
bulwark and rail, and simultaneously the foretop-gallant-mast,
which snapped just above the withe. As a
natural consequence, every thing was in the utmost
confusion—the old hull worked in every timber. The
wreck swayed to and fro, retarding the working of the
vessel and endangering the lives of those who
attempted to clear it from obstruction. Thus she
remained for more than half an hour, nearly on her
beam-ends, and at the mercy of each succeeding sea
that threatened to engulf her.</p>
            <p>As daylight broke, the wind lulled, and, as usual in
those waters, the sea soon ran down. Enabled to
take the advantage of daylight, they commenced to
clear away the wreck. In the mean time it was found
necessary to remove the fore-hatch in order to get
out some spare sails that had been stowed away near
the forward bulkhead, instead of a more
appropriate place. The mate, after trying the pumps in
the early part of the gale, reported that she had
started a leak; which, however, was so trifling as to
require but one man to keep her free, until she
broached, and carried away her topgallant-mast.
The man on duty then reported the water increasing,
and another was ordered to assist him. On an
examination in the morning, it was found that she was
strained in the fore-channels, and had started a but.</p>
            <p>"She's an unlucky concern, skipper," said the mate
as he brought the axe to take the battons off the forehatch.
"A fellow might as well try to work a crab
at low tide as to keep her to it in a blow like that.<pb n="9"/>
She minds her helm like a porpoise in the breakers.
Old Davy must have put his mark upon her some time,
but I never know'd a lucky vessel to be got as she
was. She makes a haul on the underwriters every
time she drifts across; for I never knew her to sail
clear since I shipped in the old tub. If she was mine,
I'd find a place for her at somebody's expense."</p>
            <p>The sea became smooth, the water was found to
have receded, the wind, light, had hauled to W.S.W.,
and Cape Antoine was judged by dead reckoning to
bear S.S.W. about thirty miles distant. The larboard
fore-shrouds were found to have been scorched by
the lightning, which had completely melted the tar
from the after-shroud. All hands were now busily
employed repairing the wreck, which by two o'clock
P.M. they had got so far completed as to stand on
their course in the gulf, at the rate of six knots an
hour.</p>
            <p>The skipper now consulted in his mind as to the
expediency of making for Havana or proceeding on
his cruise. The leak had materially diminished, and,
like all old vessels, though she gave a good portion
of work at the pumps, a continuation of good weather
might afford an opportunity to shove her across.
Under these feelings, he was inclined to give the
preference to his hopes rather than yield to his fears.
He considered the interest of all concerned—consulted
his mate, but found him governed by his superstition,
and looking upon the issue of his life about as certain
whether he jumped overboard or "stuck by the old
tub." He considered again the enormous port-charges
imposed in Havana, the nature of his cargo in regard
to tariff, should his vessel be condemned, and the
ruinous expenses of discharging, &amp;c. &amp;c. together with<pb n="10"/>
the cost of repairs, providing they were ordered. All
these things he considered with the mature deliberation
of a good master, who has the general interests of all
concerned at heart. So, if he put away for a port,
in consideration of all concerned, his lien for general
average would have strong ground in maritime law;
yet there were circumstances connected with the sea-worthy
condition of the craft—known to himself, if not
to the port-wardens, and which are matters of
condition between the master and his owners—which
might, upon certain technicalities of law, give rise to
strong objectionable points. With all these glancing
before him, he, with commendable prudence, resolved
to continue his voyage, and trust to kind Providence
for the best.</p>
            <p>"Captain," said the mate, as he stood viewing the
prospect, with a marlinespike in one hand and a piece
of seizing in the other—"I verily think, if that blow
had stuck to us two hours longer, the old tub would a'
rolled her futtocks out. Ye don't know her as well as
I do. She's unlucky, anyhow; and always has been
since she sot upon the water. I've seen her top-sides
open like a basket when we've been trying to work
her into port in heavy weather: and a craft that won't
look nearer than nine points close-hauled, with a stiff
breeze, ought to be sent into the Clyde for a coal-droger.
An old vessel's a perfect pickpocket to
owners; and if this old thing hasn't opened their
purses as bad as her own seams, I'll miss my reckonin'.
I've had a strong foreknowledge that we wouldn't get
across in her. I saw the rats leaving in Jamaica—taking
up their line of march, like marines on the
fore. It's a sure sign. And then I'd a dream, which is
as sure as a mainstay—never deceives me. I can<pb n="11"/>
depend on its presentiment. I have dreamed it several
times, and we always had an awful passage. Twice
we come within a bobstay of all goin' to Old Davy's
store-house. I once escaped it, after I'd had my
mysterious dream; but then I made the cook throw
the cat overboard just after we left port, and 'twas
all that saved us."</p>
            <p>Thus saying, he went forward to serve a topgallant-stay
that was stretched across the forecastle-hatch
from the cat-heads, and had just been spliced by the
men, followed by an old-fashioned sea-urchin, a
miniature of the tar, with a mallet in his hand. The
captain, although a firm, intelligent man, and little
given to such notions of fate as are generally entertained
by sailors, who never shake off the spiritual
imaginings of the forecastle, displayed some
discomfiture of mind at the strong character of the mate's
misgivings. He knew him to be a good sailor, firm
in his duty, and unmoved by peril. This he had
proved on several occasions when sailing in other
vessels, when the last ray of hope seemed to be gone.
He approached the mate again, and with a pretence
of making inquiries about the storage of the cargo,
sounded him further in regard to his knowledge of the
Bahamas, and with special reference to the port of
Nassau.</p>
            <p>"Six-tenths of her timbers are as rotten as punk,"
said the mate; "this North American timber never
lasts long; the pump-wells are defective, and when
we carry sail upon her, they don't affect the water in
the lee-bilge, and she rolls it through her air-streaks
like a whale. She'll damage the best cargo that ever
floated, in that way. Take my word for it, skipper,
she'll never go across the Banks; she'll roll to splinters<pb n="12"/>
as soon as she gets into them long seas; and if we get
dismasted again, it's gone Davy."</p>
            <p>"I know the old scow before to-day, and wouldn't
shipped in her, if I hadn't been lime-juiced by that
villanous landlord that advanced me the trifle. But I
seen she was as deep as a luggerman's sand-barge,
and I popped the old cat overboard, just as we rounded
the point coming out o' Kingston harbour," said a
fine, active-looking sailor, who bore every trait of a
royal tar, and boasted of serving five years in the
East-India service, to his shipmate, while he continued
to serve the stay. His words were spoken in a
whisper, and not intended for the captain's ears.
The captain overheard him, however; and, as a vessel
is a world to those on board, the general sentiment
carries its weight in controlling its affairs. Thus the
strong feeling which prevailed on board could not
fail to have its effect upon the captain's mind.</p>
            <p>"Well, we'll try her at any rate," said the captain,
walking aft and ordering the cabin-boy to bring up
his glass; with which he took a sharp look to the
southward.</p>
            <p>"I'd shape her course for a southern Yankee port.
I haven't been much in them, but I think we'll stand
a better chance there than in these ports where they
make a speculation of wrecking, and would take a
fellow's pea-jacket for salvage." "We're always better
under the protection of a consul than in a British
port," said the mate, coming aft to inform the skipper
that they had carried away the chains of the bobstay,
and that the bowsprit strained her in the knight-heads.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE STEWARD'S BRAVERY.</head>
            <p>DURING the worst of the gale, a mulatto man, with
prominent features, indicating more of the mestino
than negro character, was moving in busy occupation
about the deck, and lending a willing hand with the
rest of the crew to execute the captain's orders. He
was rather tall, well formed, of a light olive complexion,
with dark, piercing eyes, a straight, pointed nose, and
well-formed mouth. His hair, also, had none of that
crimp so indicative of negro extraction, but lay in
dark curls all over his head. As he answered to the
captain's orders, he spoke in broken accents, indicating
but little knowledge of the English language. From
the manner in which the crew treated him, it was
evident that he was an established favourite with them
as well as the officers, for each appeared to treat him
more as an equal than a menial. He laboured
cheerfully at sailor's duty until the first sea broke over her,
when, seeing that the caboose was in danger of being
carried from the lashings, and swept to leeward in
the mass of wreck, he ran for that all-important
apartment, and began securing it with extra lashings.
He worked away with an earnestness that deserved
all praise; not with the most satisfactory effect for
an angry sea immediately succeeding completely
stripped the furnace of its woodwork, and in its force<pb n="14"/>
carried the gallant fellow among its fragments into
the lee-scuppers, where he saved himself from going
overboard only by clinging to a stanchion.</p>
            <p>The second mate, a burly old salt, ran to his assistance,
but, before he reached him, our hero had recovered
himself, and was making another attempt to
reach his coppers. It seemed to him as much a
pending necessity to save the cooking apparatus as it
did the captain to save the ship.</p>
            <p>"He no catch me dis time," said he to the mate,
smiling as he lifted his drenched head from among
the fragments of the wreck. "I fix a de coffee in him
yet, please God."</p>
            <p>After securing the remains of his cooking utensils,
he might be seen busily employed over a little stove,
arranged at the foot of the stairs that led to the cabin.
The smoke from the funnel several times annoyed the
captain, who laboured under the excitement
consequent upon the confusion of the wreck and peril of
his vessel, bringing forth remonstrances of no very
pleasant character. It proved that the good steward
was considering how he could best serve Jack's
necessities; and while they were laboring to save the ship,
lie was studiously endeavoring to anticipate the
craving of their stomachs. For when daylight
appeared and the storm subsided, the steward had a
bountiful dish of hot coffee to relieve Jack's fatigued
system. It was received with warm welcome, and
many blessings were heaped upon the head of the
steward; A good "<emph>doctor</emph>" is as essential for the
interests of owners and crew as a good captain. So
it proved in this instance, for while he had a careful
regard for the stores, he never failed to secure the
praises of the crew.</p>
            <pb n="15"/>
            <p>"When I gib de stove fire, den me gib de Cap-i-tan,
wid de crew, some good breakfas," said he with a
gleam of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>This individual, reader, was Manuel Pereira, or, as
he was called by his shipmates, <hi>Pe-rah-re</hi>. Manuel
was born in Brazil, an extract of the Indians and
Spanish, claiming birthright of the Portuguese nation.
It mattered but very little to Manuel where he was
born, for he had been so long tossed about in his
hardy vocation that he had almost become alienated
from the affections of birthplace. He had sailed so
long under the protection of the <emph>main-jack</emph> of old
England that he had formed a stronger allegiance to
that country than to any other. He had sailed under
it with pride, had pointed to its emblem, as if he
felt secure, when it was unfurled, that the register-ticket
which that government had given him was a
covenant between it and himself; that it was a ticket
to incite him to good behavior in a foreign country;
and that the flag was sure to protect his rights, and
insure, from the government to which he sailed
respect and hospitality. He had sailed around the
world under it—visited savage and semi-civilized
nations—had received the hospitality of cannibals,
had joined in the merry dance with the Otaheitian,
had eaten fruits with the Hottentots, shared the
coarse morsel of the Greenlander, been twice chased
by the Patagonians—but what shall we say?—he
was imprisoned, for the olive tints of his color, in a
land where not only civilization rules in its brightest
conquests, but chivalry and honor sound its fame
within the lanes, streets, and court-yards. Echo
asks, Where—where? We will tell the reader.
That flag which had waved over him so long and in<pb n="16"/>
so many of his wayfarings—that flag which had so
long boasted its rule upon the wave, and had
protected him among the savage and the civilized, found
a spot upon this wonderful globe where it ceased to
do so, unless he could change his skin.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE SECOND STORM.</head>
            <p>ON the fourth night succeeding the perilous position
of the Janson off Cape Antoine, the brig was
making about seven knots, current of the gulf
included. The sun had set beneath heavy radiant
clouds, which rolled up like masses of inflamed matter,
reflecting in a thousand mellow shades, and again
spreading their gorgeous shadows upon the rippled
surface of the ocean, making the picture serene and
grand.</p>
            <p>As darkness quickly followed, these beautiful
transparencies of a West-India horizon gradually changed
into murky-looking monitors, spreading gloom in the
sombre perspective. The moon was in its second
quarter, and was rising on the earth. The mist
gathered thicker and thicker as she ascended, until
at length she became totally obscured. The Captain
sat upon the companion-way, anxiously watching the
sudden change that was going on overhead; and,
without speaking to any one, rose, took a glance
at the compass, and then went forward to the lookout,<pb n="17"/>
charging him to keep a sharp watch, as they were
not only in a dangerous channel, but in the track of
vessels bound into and out of the gulf. After this,
he returned amidship, where the little miniature salt
we have described before lay, with his face
downward, upon the main-hatch, and ordering him to bring
the lead-line, he went to leeward and took a cast;
and after paying out about twenty-five fathoms
without sounding, hauled aboard again. The wind was
southward and light. As soon as he had examined
the lead he walked aft and ordered the sheets eased
and the vessel headed two points farther off. This
done, he went below, and shaking his barometer
several times, found it had begun to fall very fast.
Taking down his coast-chart, he consulted it very
studiously for nearly half an hour, laying off an
angle with a pair of dividers and scale, with
mathematical minuteness; after which he pricked his course
along the surface to a given point. This was intended
as his course.</p>
            <p>"Where do you make her, Captain?" said the
mate, as he lay in his berth.</p>
            <p>"We must be off the Capes—we must keep a sharp
look out for them reefs. They are so deceptive that
we'll be on to them before we know it. There's no
telling by sounding. We may get forty fathoms one
minute and strike the next. I've heard old West-India
coasters say the white water was the best
warning," replied the Captain.</p>
            <p>"I'm mighty afraid of that Carysfort reef, since
I struck upon it in 1845. I was in a British schooner
then, bound from Kingston, Jamaica, to New York.
We kept a bright lookout, all the way through the
passage, and yet struck, one morning just about <orig>day-</orig>
               <pb n="18"/>
light; and, five minutes before, we had sounded without
getting bottom. When it cleared away, that we
could see, there was two others like ourselves. One
was the ship John Parker, of Boston, and the other
was a 'long-shoreman. We had a valuable cargo on
board, but the craft wasn't hurt a bit; and if the
skipper—who was a little colonial man, not much
acquainted with the judicial value of a wrecker's
services—had a' taken my advice, he wouldn't got
into the snarl he did at Key West, where they carried
him, and charged him thirty-six hundred dollars for
the job. Yes, and a nice little commission to the
British consul for counting the doubloons, which,
by-the-by, Skipper, belonged to that great house of
Howland &amp; Aspinwalls. They were right clever
fellows, and it went into the general average account
for the relief of the underwriters' big chest," continued
the mate.</p>
            <p>"We must have all hands ready at the call," said
the Captain. "It looks dirty overhead, and I think
we're going to catch it from the north-east to-night.
If we do, our position is not as good as before. I
don't feel afraid of her, if we only get clear of this
infernal coast," said the Skipper, as he rolled up his
chart, and repaired on deck again.</p>
            <p>During this time, Manuel, who, had given the crew
some very acceptable hot cakes for supper, was sitting
upon the windlass, earnestly engaged, with his broken
English, recounting an adventure he had on the coast
of Patagonia, a few years previous, while serving on
board a whaleman, to a shipmate who sat at his left.
It was one of those incidents which frequently occur
to the men attached to vessels which visit that coast
for the purpose of providing a supply of wood and<pb n="19"/>
water, and which would require too much space to
relate here.</p>
            <p>"Did you run, Manuel?" said the listening shipmate.</p>
            <p>"What else did me do? If I no run, I'd not be
here dis night, because I be make slave, or I be
killed wid club. Patagonian don't care for flag—nor
not'in' else—I trust-e my leg, an' he get to de boat
jus' when cap-i-tan come to rescue."</p>
            <p>"Was you on board an Englishman then, Manuel?"
inquired the shipmate.</p>
            <p>"Yes, I'm always sail in English ship, because I
can get protection from flag and consul, where I go—any
part of globe," said he.</p>
            <p>"I never liked this sailing among barbarous
nations; they've no respect for any flag, and would just
as lief imprison an Englishman or an American as
they would a dog. They're a set of wild barbarians,
and if they kill a fellow, there's no responsibility for
it. It's like a parcel of wolves chasing a lamb, and
there's no finding them after they've killed it. But
they give a fellow his rights in Old England and the
States. A man's a man there, rich or poor, and his
feelings are just as much his own as anybody's. It's
a glorious thing, this civilization, and if the world
keeps on, there'll be no danger of a fellow's being
imprisoned and killed among these savages. They're
a cowardly set, for nobody but cowards are afraid of
their own actions. Men neither imprison nor kill
strangers, that don't fear the injustice of their own
acts. You may smoke that in your pipe, Manuel, for
I've heard great men say so. But you'd been done
making dough-nuts then, Manuel, if they'd got hold
o' you."</p>
            <p>"Never catch Manuel among Patagonians, again;<pb n="20"/>
they not know what the flag be, nor they can't read
de registrum ticket, if they know'd where England
was," said Manuel; and just as he was concluding
the story of his adventure, the little sailor-boy put
his arm around Manuel's waist, and, laying his head
on his breast, fondled about him with an affectionate
attachment. The little fellow had been a shipmate
with Manuel on several voyages, and, through the
kindness he had received at his hands, naturally
formed an ardent attachment to him. Taking
advantage of the good treatment, he knew how to direct
his attention to the steward whenever he wanted a
snack from the cabin-locker of that which was not
allowed in the forecastle. After holding him for a
minute, encircling his arm around the little fellow's
shoulder, he arose, and saying, "I know what you
want, Tommy," proceeded to the cabin and brought
him several little eatables that had been left at the
captain's table.</p>
            <p>The wind now began to veer and increase, her sails
kept filling aback; and as often as the man at the
helm kept her off, the wind would baffle him, until
finding it would be necessary to go on the other tack,
or make some change of course, he called the Captain.
The moment the latter put his foot upon deck, he
found his previous predictions were about to be
verified. The rustling noise of the gulf, mingling
its solemn sounds with the petrel-like music of that
foreboding wind that "whistles through the shrouds,"
awakened the more superstitious sensations of a
sailor's heart. The clouds had gathered their sombre
folds into potent conclaves, while the sparkling brine
in her wake, seemed like a fiery stream, rolling its
troubled foam upon the dark waters.</p>
            <pb n="21"/>
            <p>"Brace the yards up sharp—hard a-starboard!—and
trim aft the sheets," ordered the Captain, who
had previously given the order, "All hands on
deck!"</p>
            <p>The order was scarcely executed, before the noise
of the approaching gale was heard in the distance.
All hands were ordered to shorten sail as quickly as
possible; but before they could get aloft, it came
upon them with such fury from E.N.E. as to carry
away the foretop-mast and topgallant-mast, together
with its sails, and the main-topgallant-mast with the
sail. The foretop-mast, in going by the board,
carried away the flying-jib-boom and flying-jibs.
Thus the ill-fated Janson was doomed to another
struggle for her floating existence. The sea began
to rise and break in fearful power; the leak had
already increased so, that two men were continually
kept working the pumps. The crew, with
commendable alacrity, cut away the wreck, which had
been swaying to and fro, not only endangering the
lives of those on board, but obstructing every attempt
to get the vessel into any kind of working order.
The main-sail had rent from the leash to the peak of
the gaff, and was shaking into shreds. The starboard
sheet of the maintop-sail was gone, and it had torn
at the head from the bolt-rope, flying at every gust
like the shreds of a muslin rag in a hail-storm.
Without the government of her helm, she lay in the
trough of the sea more like a log than a manageable
mass. Sea after sea broke over her, carrying every
thing before them at each pass. The officers and
crew had now as much as they could do to retain
their holds, without making any effort to save the
wreck, while the men at the pumps could only work<pb n="22"/>
at each subsiding of the sea, and that under the
disadvantage of being lashed to the frame. A more
perilous position than that in which the old brig
Janson now lay, it was impossible to imagine.</p>
            <p>"'Tis the worst hurricane I've ever experienced
upon the West India coast, Captain, but it's too
furious to last long; and if she don't go to pieces
before morning, I'll give her credit for what I've
always swore against her. She can't keep afloat
though, if it hangs on another hour in this way,"
said the mate, who, with the Captain and Manuel, had
just made an ineffectual attempt to rig a storm stay-sail,
to try and lay her to under it. For the mate
swore by his knowledge of her qualities, that to put
her before it, would be certain foundering. The gale
continued with unabated fury for about two hours,
and stopped about as suddenly as it commenced.
The work of destruction was complete, for from her
water-line to the stump of the remaining spars, the
Janson floated a complete wreck.</p>
            <p>The captain gave orders to clear away the wreck,
and get what little sail they could patch up, upon
her, for the purpose of working her into the nearest
port. The mate was not inclined to further the order,
evidently laboring under the strong presentiment
that she was to be their coffin. He advised that it
was fruitless to stick by her any longer, or hazard an
attempt to reach a port with her, in such a leaky and
disabled condition. "If we don't abandon her,
Skipper," said he, "she'll abandon us. We'd better
make signal for the first vessel, and bid the old coffin
good-by."</p>
            <p>The captain was more determined in his resolution,
and instead of being influenced by the mate's fears,<pb n="23"/>
continued his order, and the men went to work with
a cheerful willingness. None seemed more anxious
to lend a ready hand than Manuel, for in addition to
is duties as steward, he had worked at sail-making,
and both worked at and directed the repairing of the
sails. Those acquainted with maritime affairs can
readily appreciate the amount of labor necessary to
provide a mess with the means at hand that we have
before described. And yet he did it to the
satisfaction of all, and manifested a restless anxiety lest
he should not make everybody comfortable, and
particularly his little pet boy, Tommy.</p>
            <p>"We'll get a good observation at meridian, and then
we shall shape our course for Charleston, South
Carolina. We'll be more likely to reach it than any other
southern port," said the captain to his mate. "That
steward, Manuel, is worth his weight in gold. If we have
to abandon the old craft, I'll take him home; the
owners respect him just as much as a white man; his
politeness and affability could not but command such
esteem, with a man that a'n't a fool. I never believed
in making equals of negroes, but if Manuel was to be
classed with niggers for all the nigger blood that's in
him, seven-tenths of the inhabitants of the earth
would go with him. I never saw such an attachment
between brothers, as exists between him and Tommy.
I verily believe that one couldn't go to sleep without
the other. I should think they were brothers, if the
lad wasn't English, and Manuel a Portuguese. But
Manuel is as much an Englishman at heart as the
lad, and has sailed so long under the flag that he
seems to have a reverence for the old jack when he
sees the bunting go up. He likes to tell that story
about the Patagonians chasing him. I have overheard<pb n="24"/>
him several times, as much amused in his own recital
as if he was listening to the quaint jokes of an old
tar. But he swears the Patagonians will never catch
him on their shores again, for he says he doesn't
believe in making 'drum-head of man-skin,'" said the
Captain, evidently with the intention of affecting the
mate's feelings, and drawing his mind from its dark
forebodings.</p>
            <p>"Well, Skipper, I pray for a happy deliverance,"
said the mate, "but if we make Charleston with her,
it'll be a luck that man nor mermaid ever thought of.
I hearn a good deal o' tell about Charleston, and the
Keys. That isn't one of the places our stewards are
so 'fraid of, and where owners don't like to send their
ships when they can find freight in other ports?"</p>
            <p>"I expect it is, sir; but I apprehend no such
trouble with any of my crew," answered the Captain
promptly. "I sail under the faith of my nation's
honor and prowess, the same as the Americans do
under theirs. We're both respected wherever we go,
and if one little State in the Union violates the
responsibility of a great nation like that, I'm mistaken.
Certainly, no nation in Christendom could
be found, that wouldn't open their hearts to a shipwrecked
sailor. I have too much faith in what I
have heard of the hospitality of Southerners, to
believe any thing of that kind."</p>
            <p>"Talk's all very well, Skipper," said the mate;
"but my word for it, I know'd several ships lying in
the Mersey, about three years ago, bound to Southern
ports for cotton. White stewards worth any thing
couldn't be had for love nor money, and the colored
ones wouldn't ship for ports in Slaves States. The
Thebis got a colored man, but the owners had to pay<pb n="25"/>
him an enormous advance, and this, too, with the
knowledge of his being locked up the whole time he
was in port; thus having to incur the very useless
expense of supplying his place, or find boarding-house
accommodations for the officers and crew.
If it be true, what I've hearn 'em say in the Mersey,
the man doesn't only suffer in his feelings by some
sort of confinement they have, but the owners suffer
in pocket. But it may be, Skipper, and I'm inclined
to think with you, our case is certainly deplorable
enough to command pity instead of imprisonment.
The government must be found cutting a dirty figure
on the national picture, that would ill-treat sailors
who had suffered as much as our boys have. I would
hate to see Manuel shut up or ill-used. He's as brave
a fellow as ever buckled at a handspike or rode a
jib-boom. Last night, while in the worst of the gale,
he volunteered to take Higgins's place, and, mounting
the jib-boom, was several times buried in the sea;
yet he held on like a bravo, and succeeded in cutting
away the wreck. I thought he was gone once or
twice, and I own I never saw more peril at sea; but
if he hadn't effected it, the foot of the bowsprit
would have strained her open in the eyes, and we'd
all been sharks'-bait before this. The fellow was
nearly exhausted when he came on board; says I,
its gone day with you, old fellow; but he come to
in a little while, and went cheerily to work again,"
continued Mr. Mate, who though pleased with the
Captain's determination to make the nearest port,
seemed to dread that all would not be right in Charleston—that
the bar was a very intricate one—water
very shoal in the ship-channel, and though marked
with three distinctive buoys, numbered according to<pb n="26"/>
their range, impossible to crops without a skilful
pilot. The mate plead a preference for Savannah,
asserting, according to his own knowlege, that a ship
of any draft could cross that bar at any time of tide,
and that it was a better port for the transaction of
business.</p>
            <p>The Janson was headed for Charleston, the queen
city of the sunny South, and, as may be expected
from her disabled condition, made very slow progress
on her course. During the gale, her stores had become
damaged, and on the third day before making
Charleston light, Manuel Pereira came aft, and with
a sad countenance reported that the last cask of good
water was nearly out; that the others had all been
stove during the gale, and what remained, so brackish
that it was unfit for use. From this time until their
arrival at Charleston, they suffered those tortures of
thirst, which only those who have endured them can
estimate.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE CHARLESTON POLICE.</head>
            <p>MR. DURKEE had said in Congress, that a negro
was condemned to be hung in Charleston for resisting
his master's attempts upon the chastity of his
wife; and that such was the sympathy expressed for
the negro, that the sheriffs offer of one thousand dollars
could induce no one present to execute the final
mandate. Now, had Mr. Durkee been better acquainted
with that social understanding between the
slave, the pretty wife, and his master, and the acquiescing
pleasure of the slave, who in nineteen cases out
of twenty congratulates himself on the distinguished
honor, he would have saved himself the error of
such a charge against the tenor of social life in
Charleston. Or, had he been better acquainted with
the character of her police, he certainly would have
saved the talent of Mr. Aiken its sophomore display
in that cumbrous defence. In the first place, Mr.
Durkee would have known that such attempts are so
common among the social events of the day, and so
well understood by the slave, that instead of being
resented, they are appreciated to a great extent.
We speak from long experience and knowledge of the
connection between a certain class of slaves and their
masters. In the second place, Mr. Durkee would
have known that any man connected with the city
police—save its honorable mayor, to whose character
we would pay all deference—would not for <orig>
                  <emph>con-</emph>
               </orig>
               <pb n="28"/>
               <emph>science'</emph> sake scruple to hang a man for five dollars.
We make no exception for color or crime. A qualification
might be called for, more adapted to our
knowledge of it as it has existed for the last four or
five years; but we are informed by those whose lives
and fortunes have been spent for the moral elevation
of the city police, that it was even worse at the time
referred to.</p>
            <p>The reader may think we are making grave charges.
Let us say, without fear of refutation, they are too
well known in the community that tolerates them.
As a mere shadow of what lays beneath the surface,
we would refer to the only independent speech we
ever listened to in Charleston,—except when self-laudation
was the theme,—made by G. R——, Esq.,
in one of her public halls a few weeks ago. Mr.
R—— is a gentleman of moral courage and integrity,
and, without fear or trembling, openly denounced
the corruption and demoralization of the police department.
Even the enemies of his party, knowing
the facts, appreciated his candor as a man, while
they denounced the publicity, (for his speech was
paraded by the press,) lest the fair name of the queen
city should suffer abroad. A beautiful farce followed
this grave exposition. The board of aldermen,
composed of fourteen men of very <emph>general</emph> standing,
remained mum under the accusation for a long time.
Its object was to show up the character of a class of
officials, whose character and nefarious arts have long
disgraced the city. But in order to make a display
of his purity, Mr. C——, a gentleman entitled to
high moral consideration, chose to make it a personal
matter; yet, not content with a private explanation
given by Mr. R——, he made a call through<pb n="29"/>
the press. Mr. R—— responded in a proper and
courteous manner, acknowledging the due respect to
which Mr. C——'s private character was entitled;
thus increasing the ambition of the board generally,
who, with the expectation of Mr. R—— making a
like acknowledgment to them as a body, (not excepting
their honorable head,) made a demand in joint-officio.
This being duly signalized through the
columns of the Courier and Mercury, Mr. R—— met
it with a response worthy of a gentleman. He referred
them to the strongest evidence of his assertions,
in the countenance which they gave to a class
of officials too well known to the community for the
honor of its name and the moral foundation of its
corporate dignity. Thus ended a great municipal
farce, to prolong which the principal performers knew
would disclose the intriguing scenes of their secondary
performers. The plot of this melo-comic concern
was in the sequel, and turned upon the very
grave fact of Mr. C—— having some time previous
withdrawn from the honorable board, to preserve
some very delicate considerations for <emph>conscience'
sake.</emph>
            </p>
            <p>How much spiritual consolation Mr. C—— realized
through the acknowledgment of Mr. R——, or
the honorable board in joint-officio from the firm admonition,
we leave for the secondary consideration
of proper wives and daughters.</p>
            <p>But the reader will ask, what has this to do with
poor Manuel Pereira,—or the imprisonment of free
citizens of a friendly nation? We will show him that
the complex system of official spoliation, and the misrepresentations
of the police in regard to the influence
of such persons upon the slave population, is a<pb n="30"/>
principal feature in its enforcement. To do this, we
deem it essentially necessary to show the character
of such men and the manner in which this law is carried
out. We shall make no charges that we cannot
sustain by the evidence of the whole city proper, and
with the knowledge that truth is stronger than fiction.</p>
            <p>What will the reader say when we tell him that,
among the leading minds of the city—we say leading
minds, for we class those who are considered foremost
in the mercantile sphere among them—are
three brothers, unmarried, but with mistresses bought
for <emph>the</emph> purpose, whose dark skins avert the tongue of
scandal;—that, twice, men were sold, because of the
beauty of their wives, to distant traders, that the
brothers might cast off their old mistresses, and appropriate
new ones to an unholy purpose; that these
men enjoy their richly furnished mansions, are known
for their sumptuous entertainments, set an example
of mercantile honor and integrity, are flattered
among the populace, receive the attentions of very
fine and very virtuous ladies, wield a potential voice
in the city government, and lead in the greatest
development of internal improvements;—that these
men even whisper high-sounding words of morality,
and the established custom considers their example
no harm when color is modified.</p>
            <p>What will the reader think, when we tell him that
there is no city-marshal in Charleston, but innumerable
marshalled men, supported by an onerous tax
upon the people, to quiet the fears of a few. And
what will they think, when we tell them that the man
whose name is so frequently sounded through the
columns of the press as the head of police, and applauded
for his activity among thieves, is the <orig>well-</orig>
               <pb n="31"/>
known prince-officio of a voluptuous dwelling, where
dazzling licentiousness fills his pockets with the spoils
of allurement. This man has several counterparts,
whose acts are no secrets to the public ear, and who
turn their office into a mart of intrigue, and have
enriched themselves upon the bounty of espionage and
hush-money, and now assert the dignity of their purse.
It may be asked, why are these men kept in office?—or
have these offices become so disgraced that honest
men will not deign to accept them? No! such is not
the case. It is that moral integrity is not considered
in its proper light, and is not valued as it should
be; that these men have a secret influence which is
well known, and are countenanced and retained for
the weight of their control among a certain class;
and, strange to say, that the party ex-officio make
these demoralizing things the basis of their complaints
against the "powers that be;" yet such is their feeble
dependence, that no sooner are they in office than we
have the repetition of the same things.</p>
            <p>Now, how far his honor is answerable for these
things we must leave the reader to judge. The leading
characteristics of his nature conflict with each
other; his moral character is what is considered sound
here; and truly he is entitled to much respect for his
exemplary conduct, whether it be only exerted as
an example, or the heartfelt love of Christian purity.
Some people are pious from impulse, and become
affected when purpose serves to make it profitable.
We, however, are not so uncharitable as to charge
such piety to our worthy head of the city government,
but rather to a highly developed organ of the love of
office, which has outgrown the better inclinations of
his well-established Christianity.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>We must invite the reader's attention to another
and still more glaring evidence of the demoralization
of social life in Charleston. A notorious woman, who
has kept the worst kind of a brothel for years, where
harlots of all shades and importations break the
quietude of night with their polluted songs, becomes
so bold in her infamy that she appeals to the gracious
considerations of the city council, (board of aldermen.)
How is this? Why, we will tell the reader:—She
remained unmolested in her trade of demoralization,
amassed a fortune which gave her boldness, while
her open display was considered very fine fun for the
joking propensities of officials and gallants. With
her wealth she reared a splendid mansion to infamy
and shame, where she, and such as she, whose steps
the wise man tells us "lead down to hell," could sway
their victory over the industrious poor. So public
was it, that she openly boasted its purpose and its
adaptation to the ensnaring vices of passion. Yes,
this create in female form had spread ruin and
death through the community, and brought the head
of many a brilliant young man to the last stage of cast-off
misery. And yet, so openly tolerated and countenanced
by leading men are these things, that on the
31st of July, 1852, this mother of crime appeals to
the honorable board of aldermen, as appeared in the
"Proceedings of Council" in the Charleston Courier
of that date, in the following manner:</p>
            <p>"Laid over until a monied quorum is present.</p>
            <p>"Letter from Mrs. G. Pieseitto, informing Council
that having recessed her new brick building in Berresford
street at least two feet, so as to dedicate it to the
use of the citizens of Charleston, if they will pave
with flag-stones the front of her lot, respectfully<pb n="33"/>
requests, that if accepted, the work may be done as
soon as possible. Referred to the Aldermen, Ward
No. 4." The street is narrow and little used, except
for purposes known to the <emph>lanterns</emph>, when honest
people should sleep. The information might have
been couched with more modesty, when the notoriety
of the woman and the dedication of her tabernacle
of vice was so public. How far the sensitive aldermen
of the fourth ward have proceeded in the delicate
mission, or how much champagne their modest consideration
has cost, the public have not yet been informed.
Rumor says every thing is favorable. We are only
drawing from a few principal points, and shall leave
the reader to draw his own inference of the moral
complexion of our social being. We make but one
more view, and resume our story.</p>
            <p>An office connected with the judiciary, so long held
as one of high responsibility and honorable position,
is now held merely as a medium of miserable speculation
and espionage. It is an elective office, the
representative holding for four years. The present
incumbent was elected more through charity than
recompense for any amiable qualities, moral worth,
or efficient services to party ends. A more weak man
could not have been drawn from the lowest scale of
party hirelings, though he had abdicated the office
once before to save his name and the respectability
of the judiciary. It may be said, he was elected in
pity to speculate on misery; and thus it proved in the
case of MANUEL PEREIRA. This functionary was
elected by a large majority. Could his moral worth
have been taken into consideration? We should think
not! For several times have we been pointed to two
interesting girls,—or, if their color was not shaded,<pb n="34"/>
would be called young ladies—promenading the shady
side of King street, with their faces deeply vailed,
and informed who was their father. The mother of
these innocent victims had been a mother to their
father, had nursed him and maintained him through
his adversity, and had lived the partner of his life and
affections for many years, and had reared to him an
interesting but fatal family. But, no sooner had
fortune begun to shed its smiling rays, than he abandoned
the one that had watched over him for the choice
of one who could boast no more than a white skin.</p>
            <p>If men who fill high places live by teaching others
to gratify their appetites and pleasures alone, instead
of setting a commendable example for a higher state
of existence, by whom can we expect that justice
and moral worth shall be respected?</p>
            <p>Connected with the city constabulary are two men
whose duty it is to keep a sharp lookout for all
vessels arriving, and see that all negroes or colored
seamen are committed to prison. One is a South
Carolinian, by the name of Dusenberry, and the other
an Irishman, by the name of Dunn. These two men,
although their office is despicable in the eyes of many,
assume more authority over a certain class of persons,
who are unacquainted with the laws, than the mayor
himself. The former is a man of dark, heavy features,
with an assassin-like countenance, more inclined to
look at you distrustfully than to meet you with an
open gaze. He is rather tall and athletic, but never
has been known to do any thing that would give him
credit for bravery. Several times he has been on the
brink of losing his office for giving too much latitude
to his craving for perquisites; yet, by some unaccountable
means, he manages to hold on. The other<pb n="35"/>
is a robust son of the Emerald Isle, with a broad,
florid face, low forehead, short crispy hair very red,
and knotted over his forehead. His dress is usually
very slovenly and dirty, his shirt-collar bespotted
with tobacco-juice, and tied with an old striped bandana
handkerchief. This, taken with a very wide
mouth, flat nose, vicious eye, and a countenance as
hard as ever came from Tipperary, and a lame leg,
which causes him to limp as he walks, gives our man
Dunn the incarnate appearance of a fit body-grabber.
A few words will suffice for his character. He is
known to the official department, of which the magistrates
are a constituent part, as a notorious ——l;
and his better-half, who, by-the-way, is what is called
a free-trader, meaning, to save the rascality of a
husband, sells liquor by small portions, to suit the
Murphys and the O'Neals. But, as it pleases our
Mr. Dunn, he very often becomes a more than profitable
customer, and may be found snoring out the
penalty in some sequestered place, too frequently for
his own character. Between the hours of ten and
twelve in the morning, Dunn, if not too much incapacitated,
may be seen limping his way down Broad
street, to watch vessels arriving and departing, carrying
a limp-cane in one hand, and a large covered
whip in the other. We were struck with the appearance
of the latter, because it was similar to those
carried in the hands of a rough, menial class of men
in Macon, Georgia, who called themselves <emph>marshals</emph>,
under a misapplication of the term. Their office was
to keep the negro population "<emph>straight</emph>," and do the
whipping when called upon, at fifty cents a head.
They also did the whipping at the jails, and frequently
made from five to six dollars a day at this alone; for<pb n="36"/>
it is not considered fashionable for a gentleman to
whip his own negro. We noticed the universal carrying
of this whip, when we first visited Macon, some
four years ago, and were curious to know its purport,
which was elucidated by a friend; but we have since
seen the practical demonstrations painfully carried
out. Those who visited Boston for the recovery of
Crafts and Ellen—whose mode of escape is a romance
in itself—were specimens of these "<emph>marshals</emph>." How
they passed themselves off for gentlemen, we are at a
loss to comprehend.</p>
            <p>During the day, the Messrs. Dusenberry and Dunn
may be seen at times watching about the wharves,
and again in low grog-shops—then pimping about the
"Dutch beer-shops and corner-shops"—picking up,
here and there, a hopeful-looking <hi>nigger</hi>, whom they
drag off to limbo, or extort a bribe to let him go.
Again, they act as monitors over the Dutch corner-shops,
the keepers of which pay them large sums to
save themselves the heavy license fine and the information
docket. When they are no longer able to
pay over hush-money, they find themselves walked
up to the captain's office, to be dealt with according
to the severe penalty made and provided for violating
the law which prohibits the sale of liquor to negroes
without an order. The failure to observe this law is
visited with fine and imprisonment,—both beyond
their proportionate deserts, when the law which
governs the sale of liquor to white men is considered.
Things are very strictly regulated by complexions in
South Carolina. The master sets the most dissipated
and immoral examples in his own person, and
allows his children not only to exercise their youthful
caprices, but to gratify such feelings as are pernicious<pb n="37"/>
to their moral welfare, upon his slaves. Now, the
question is, that knowing the negro's power of imitation,
ought not some allowance to be made for copying
the errors of his master? Yet such is not the case;
for the slightest deviation from the strictest rule of
discipline brings condign punishment upon the head
of the offender.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
            <head type="sub">MR. GRIMSHAW, THE MAN OF THE COUNTY.</head>
            <p>ON the 22d of March last, about ten o'clock in the
morning, a thin, spare-looking man, dressed in a
black cashmeret suit, swallow-tail coat, loose-cut
pants, a straight-breasted vest, with a very extravagant
shirt-collar rolling over upon his coat, with a
black ribbon tied at the throat, stood at the east
corner of Broad and Meeting street, holding a very
excited conversation with officers Dusenberry and
Dunn. His visage was long, very dark—much more
so than many of the colored population—with pointed
nose and chin, standing in grim advance to each
other; his face narrow, with high cheek-bones, small,
peering eyes, contracted forehead, reclining with a
sunken arch between the perceptive and intellectual
organs—or, perhaps, we might have said, where those
organs should have been. His countenance was full
of vacant restlessness; and as he stared at you
through his glasses, with his silvery gray hair hanging<pb n="38"/>
about his ears and neck in shaggy points, rolling
a large quid of tobacco in his mouth, and dangling a
little whip in his right hand, you saw the index to his
office. As he raised his voice—which he did by
twisting his mouth on one side, and working his chin
to adjust his enormous quid—the drawling tone in
which he spoke gave a picture not easily forgotten.</p>
            <p>"You must pay more attention to the arrivals,"
said he in a commanding tone. "The loss of one
of these fellers is a serious drawback to my pocket;
and that British consul's using the infernalest means
to destroy our business, that ever was. He's worse
than the vilest abolitionist, because he thinks he's
protected by that flag of their'n. If he don't take
care, we'll tar-and-feather him; and if his government
says much about it, she'll larn <emph>what</emph> and <emph>who</emph>
South Carolina is. We can turn out a dozen Palmetto
regiments that'd lick any thing John Bull could send
here, and a troop o' them d——d Yankee abolitionists
besides. South Carolina's got to show her hand yet
against these fellers, afore they'll respect the honor
and standing of her institutions. They can't send
their navy to hurt us. And it shows that I always
predicts right; for while these commercial fellers
about the wharves are telling about digging out the
channel, I've al'ays said they didn't think how much
injury they were doing; for it was our very best
protection in war-time. South Carolina can lick
John Bull, single-fisted, any time; but if that pack
of inconsiderate traders on the wharves get their own
way, away goes our protection, and John Bull would
bring his big ships in and blow us up. And these
fellows that own ships are getting so bold, that a
great many are beginning to side with Mathew, the<pb n="39"/>
consul. Yes, they even swear that 'tis the officials
that stick to the law for the sake of the fees. Now,
if I only knew that the consul was the means of that
Nassau nigger getting away, I'd raise a mob, and
teach him a lesson that South Carolinians ought to
have teached him before. It took about seventeen
dollars out of my pocket, and if I was to sue him for
it, I could get no recompense. The next time you
allow one to escape, I must place some other officer
over the port," said our man whom, we shall continue
to call Mr. Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"Sure I heard the same consul, when spakin to a
gintleman, say that the law was only an abuse of
power, to put money into the pockets of yourself and
a few like ye. And whin meself and Flin put the
irons on a big nigger that the captain was endeavoring
to skulk by keeping him in the forecastle of
the ship, he interfered between me and me duty, and
began talking his balderdash about the law. Sure,
with his own way, he'd have every nigger in the city
an abolitionist in three weeks. And sure, Mr.
Sheriff, and ye'd think they were babies, if ye'd see
himself talk to them at the jail, and send them up
things, as if they were better than the other criminals,
and couldn't live on the jail fare," said officer Dunn,
who continued to pledge himself to the sheriff that
the wharves should not be neglected, nor a hopeful
English darky escape his vigilant eye.</p>
            <p>"For my own part, I think they're better off in
jail than they would be on the wharf," continued
Grimshaw. "They're a worthless set, and ha'n't
half the character that a majority of our slaves have;
and instead of attending the captain on board, they'd
be into Elliot street, spending their money, getting<pb n="40"/>
drunk, and associating with our worst niggers. And
they all know so much about law, that they're always
teaching our bad niggers the beauties of their government,
which makes them more unhappy than they are.
Our niggers are like a shoal of fish—when one becomes
diseased, he spreads it among all the rest; and
before you know where you are, they're done gone."</p>
            <p>"They're not very profitable customers for us,
Sheriff," said Dusenberry. "We have a deal of
watching, and a mighty smart lot of trouble after we
get them fellows; and if we get a perquisite, it never
amounts to much, for I seldom knew one that had
money enough to treat as we took him up. These
Britishers a'n't like us; they don't pay off in port
and if the fellows get any thing in jail from the
consul, it's by drib-drabs, that a'n't no good, for it
all goes for liquor. And them criminals make a dead
haul upon a black steward, as soon as he is locked up.
But if these sympathizing fools follow up their bugbears
about the treatment at the jail, they'll get
things so that our business won't be worth a dollar.
For my own part, I'm not so much beholdin', for I've
made myself comfortable within the last few years,
but I want my son to succeed me in the office. But
if this consul of their'n keeps up his objections,
appeals, and his protests in this way, and finds such
men as his honor the district-attorney to second
him with his nonsense and his notions, folks of our
business might as well move north of Mason and
Dixon's."</p>
            <p>"I can wake him up to a point," said Grimshaw,
"that that abolition consul ha'n't learnt before; and
if he'd stuck his old petition in Charles Sumner's
breeches pocket instead of sending it to our <orig>legisla-</orig>
               <pb n="41"/>
ture, he might have saved his old-womanish ideas from
the showing' up that Myzeck gave 'em. It takes
Myzeck to show these blue-skin Yankees how to toe
the mark when they come to South Carolina. If
South Carolina should secede, I'd say give us Myzeck
and Commander to lead our war, and we'd be as sure
to whip 'em as we won the Mexican war for the
Federal Government. There is three things about an
Englishman, Dusenberry, which you may mark for
facts. He is self-conceited, and don't want to be
advised;—he thinks there is no law like the law of
England, and that the old union-jack is a pass-book
of nations;—and he thinks everybody's bound to obey
his notions of humanity and the dictates of his positive
opinions. But what's worse than all, they've <emph>never</emph>
seen the sovereignty of South Carolina carried out,
and according to Consul Mathew's silly notions, they
think we could be licked by a gun-boat.</p>
            <p>"It's no use arguing this thing, you must keep a
keen eye upon the English niggers; and when a man
pretends to dispute the right, tell him its '<emph>contrary
to law</emph>,' and to look at the statute-books; tell him it
costs more to keep them than they're all worth; and
if they say the law was never intended for foreign
citizens, tell 'em its '<emph>contrary to law</emph>.' South Carolina's
not bound to obey the voice of the General Government,
and what does she care for the federal courts?
We'll pursue a course according to the law; and any
thing that is contrary to it we will take care of for
the better protection of our institutions. Now, don't
let one pass, upon the peril of your office," continued
Mr. Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"It's not a button I'd care for the office," said
Dunn. "Sure it's yerself be's makin' all the fees, and<pb n="42"/>
ourselves getting the paltry dollar; and yerself gives
us as much trouble to get that as we'd be earning
two dollars at magistrate Jiles' beyant. Sure! himself's
liberal and doesn't be afraid to give us a division
of the fees when the business is good. And sure ye
make yer ten times the fees on an English nigger,
and never gives us beyant the dollar," continued he,
moving off in high dudgeon, and swearing a stream
of oaths that made the very blood chill. There was
a covert meaning about Mr. Grimshaw's language
that was not at all satisfactory to Mr. Dunn's Irish;
especially when he knew Mr. Grimshaw's insincerity
so well, and that, instead of being liberal, he pocketed
a large amount of the fees, to the very conscientious
benefit of his own dear self. The reader must remember
that in Charleston, South Carolina, there is
a large majority of men who care little for law, less
for justice, and nothing for Christianity. Without
compunction of conscience, and with an inherited
passion to set forward the all-absorbing greatness of
<emph>South Carolina</emph>, these men act as a check upon the
better-disposed citizens. The more lamentable part
is, that forming a large portion of that species of
beings known as bar-room politicians, they actually
control the elections in the city; and thus we may
account for the character of the incumbents of office,
and for the tenacity with which those oppressive laws
are adhered to. </p>
            <p>This almost incompatible conversation between a
high sheriff and two menial constables, may to many
seem inconsistent with the dignity that should be observed
between such functionaries. Nevertheless,
all restraint is not only annihilated by consent, but
so prominently is this carried out, and so well <orig>under-</orig>
               <pb n="43"/>
stood by that respectable class of citizens whose
interests and feelings are for maintaining a good
name for the city and promoting its moral integrity,
that in all our conversation with them, we never heard
one speak well of those functionaries or the manner
in which the police regulations of the city were
carried out.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE JANSON IN THE OFFING.</head>
            <p>AFTER several days' suffering for want of wafer
and fatigue of labor, several of the crew were reported
upon the sick-list. Manuel, who had borne his part
nobly and cheerfully, was among the number; and his
loss was more severely felt, having done a double
duty, and succeeded, as far as the means were at hand,
in making everybody on board comfortable. He
had attended upon those who gave up first, like a good
nurse, ready at the call, whether night or day, and
with a readiness that seemed pleasure to him. From
the captain to the little boy Tommy, his loss was felt
with regret; and the latter would often go into the
forecastle where he lay, lean over him with a child-like
simplicity, and smooth his forehead with his little
hand. "Manuel! I wish poor Manuel was well!" he
would say, and again he would lay his little hand on
his head and smooth his hair. He would whisper encouragement
in his ear; and having learned a smattering
of Portuguese, would tell him how soon they<pb n="44"/>
would be in port, and what pleasant times they would
have together.</p>
            <p>On the 21st they descried land, which proved to be
Stono, about twenty-five miles south of Charleston.
Tommy announced the news to Manuel, which seemed
to cheer him up. His sickness was evidently caused by
fatigue, and his recovery depended more upon rest and
nourishment than medical treatment. That night at
ten o'clock the wind came strong north-west, and
drove the Janson some distance to sea again; and it
was not until the morning of the 23d that she made
Charleston light, and succeeded in working up to the
bar. Signal was made for a pilot, and soon, a very
fine cutter-looking boat, "<hi>Palmetto</hi>, No. 4," was seen
shooting out over the bar in the main channel.
Manuel, somewhat recovered, had a few minutes
before been assisted on deck, and through the captain's
orders was laid upon a mattrass, stretched on
the starboard side of the companion-way. By his
side sat little Tommy, serving him with some nourishment.</p>
            <p>The boat was soon alongside, and the pilot, a
middle-sized man, well dressed, with a frank, open
countenance, rather florid and sun-stained, and a
profusion of gold chain and seal dangling from his
fob, came on board. After saluting the captain, he
surveyed the weather-beaten condition of the craft,
made several inquiries in regard to her working, and
then said in a sang-froid manner, "Well! I reckon
you've seen some knocking, anyhow." Then turning
again and giving some orders in regard, to getting
more way upon her, he viewed the laborious working
at the pumps, and walking about midships on the
larboard side, took a sharp survey of her waist.<pb n="45"/>
"Don't she leak around her topsides, Captain?" said
he.</p>
            <p>Receiving an answer in the affirmative, he gave a
glance aloft, and then at the sky to windward; asked
how long he had worked her in that condition, and
where he took the gale. "It's a wonder she hadn't
swamped ye before now. I'd a' beached her at the
first point, if she'd bin mine; I'd never stand at
slapping an old craft like this on. She reminds me of
one o' these down-east sugar-box crafts what trade
to Cuba," he continued. Then walking across the
main-hatch to the starboard side, he approached the
men who were pumping, and after inquiring about
freeing her, suddenly caught a glimpse of Manuel, as
he lay upon the mattrass with his face uncovered.</p>
            <p>"Heavens! What! have you got the yellow fever
on board at this season of the year?" he inquired of
the mate, who had just come aft to inquire about
getting some water from the pilot-boat.</p>
            <p>"No, we've had every thing else but the yellow
fever; one might as well bin on a raft as such an
infernal unlucky old tub as she is. It's the steward,
sir—he's got a touch of a fever; but he'll soon be
over it. He only wants rest, poor fellow! He's bin
a bully at work ever since the first gale. He'll mend
before he gets to town," was the reply.</p>
            <p>"Ah! then you've had a double dose of it. It
gives a fellow bringer off them capes once in a while.—-The
steward's a nigger, isn't he?" inquired the
pilot.</p>
            <p>"Nigger!—not he," said the mate. "He's a Portuguese
mixed breed; a kind o' sun-scorched subject,
like a good many of you Southerners. A nigger's
mother never had him, you may bet your 'davie on<pb n="46"/>
that. There's as much white blood in his jacket
as anybody's got, only them Portuguese are dark-lookin'
fellers. He's no fool—his name's Manuel, a
right clever feller, and the owners think as much of
him as they do of the Skipper."</p>
            <p>"Gammon," said the pilot to himself. "What would
he think if we were to show him some specimens of
our white niggers in Charleston?" And turning, he
walked past Manuel with a suspicious look, and took
a position near the man at the wheel, where he remained
for some time fingering the seals of his watch-chain.
The Captain had gone into the cabin a few
minutes before, and coming on deck again, walked
toward the place where the pilot stood, and took a
seat upon an old camp-stool.</p>
            <p>"Cap," said the pilot, "ye'll have trouble with
that nigger of your'n when ye git to town. If you
want to save yerself and the owners a d——d site o'
bother and expense, y' better keep him close when
y' haul in; and ship him off to New York the first
chance. I've seen into the mill, Cap, and y' better
take a friend's advice."</p>
            <p>"Nigger!" said the Captain indignantly, "what
do they call niggers in Charleston? My steward's
no more a nigger than you are!"</p>
            <p>"What, sir?" returned the pilot in a perfect rage.
"Do you know the insulting nature of your language?
Sir, if the law did not subject me, I would leave your
vessel instantly, and hold you personally responsible
as soon as you landed, sir."</p>
            <p>The Captain, unconscious of the tenacity with which
the chivalrous blood of South Carolina held language
that mooted a comparison of colors, considered his
answer; but could see nothing offensive in it.</p>
            <pb n="47"/>
            <p>"You asked me a question, and I gave you a proper
answer. If you consider such a man as my steward—poor
fellow—a nigger, in your country, I'm
glad that you are blessed with so many good men."</p>
            <p>"We polishes our language, Captain, when we speak
of niggers in South Carolina," said the pilot. "A
South Carolinian, sir, is a gentleman all over the
world. It don't want nothin' further than the name
of his State to insure him respect. And when foreign
folks and Northerners from them abolition States
bring free niggers into South Carolina, and then go
to comparing them to white folks, they better be
mighty careful how they stir about. South Carolina
ought to've seceded last year, when she talked about
it, and sent every Yankee home to make shoe-pegs.
We wouldn't bin insulted then, as we are now. I'll
tell you what it is, Cap," said he, rather cooling off,
"if our folks was only as spunky as they were in
eighteen hundred and thirty-two times, them fellers
what come here to feed upon South Carolina, put
the devil in the heads of the niggers, and then go
home again, would see stars and feel bullet-holes."</p>
            <p>The Captain listened to the pilot's original South
Carolina talk, or, as the pilot himself had called it,
polished language, without exhibiting any signs of
fear and trembling at its sublime dignity; yet, finding
that the pilot had misconstrued the tenor of his
answer, said, "You must have mistaken the intention
of my reply, sir; and the different manner in which
you appropriate its import may be attributed to a custom
among yourselves, which makes language offensive
that has no offensive meaning. We never carry
pistols or any such playthings in my country. We
have a moral security for our lives, and never look<pb n="48"/>
upon death as so great an enemy that we must carry
deadly weapons to defend it. In fact, pilot," he said
in a joking manner, "they're rather cumbersome little
bits for a feller's pocket: I'd rather carry my
supper and breakfast in my pocket. Now tell us,
who do you call niggers in South Carolina?"</p>
            <p>"Why, Captain, we call all what a'n't white folks.
Our folks can tell 'em <emph>right smart</emph>. They can't shirk
out if it's only marked by the seventeenth generation.
You can always tell 'em by the way they look—they
<emph>can't look you in the face</emph>, if they are ever so white.
The law snaps 'em up once in a while, and then, if
they're ever so white, it makes 'em prove it. I've
known several cases where the doubt was in favor
of the nigger, but he couldn't prove it, and had to
stand aside among the darkies. Dogs take my skin,
Cap, if theren't a Jew feller in town as white as
anybody, and his father's a doctor. It got whispered
round that he was a nigger, and the boarders where
he stayed raised a fuss about it. The nigger's father
had two of them sued for slander, but they proved
the nigger by a quirk of law that'd make a volume
bigger than Blackstone; and instead of the old Jew
getting satisfaction, the judges, as a matter of policy,
granted him time to procure further proof to show
that his son wasn't a nigger. It was a very well-considered
insinuation of the judges, but the young-un
stands about A 1 with a prime nigger-feller."</p>
            <p>"I should like to have 'em try me, to see whether
I was a nigger or a white man. It must be a funny
law, '<emph>nigger or no nigger</emph>.' If a feller's skin won't
save him, what the devil will?" said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Why, show your mother and her generation
were white, to be sure! It's easy enough done, and<pb n="49"/>
our judges are all very larned in such things—can
tell in the twinkling of an eye," said the pilot.</p>
            <p>"I should think the distinguishing points would be
to show that their mother had nothing to do with a
nigger. Do your judges make this a particular
branch of jurisprudence? If they do, I'd like to
know what they took for their text-books. If the intermixture
is as complex as what you say, I should
think some of the judges would be afraid of passing
verdict upon their own kin."</p>
            <p>"Not a whit!" said the pilot; "they know enough
for that."</p>
            <p>"Then you admit there's a chance. It must be an
amusing affair, 'pon my soul! when a nice little female
has to draw aside her vail before a court of very dignified
judges, for the purpose of having her pedigree
examined," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Oh! the devil, Cap; your getting all astray—a
woman nigger never has the advantage of the law.
They always go with the niggers, ah! ha! ha!!"</p>
            <p>"But suppose they're related to some of your big-bugs.
What then? Are your authorities so wise
and generous that they make allowance for these
things," asked the Captain, innocently.</p>
            <p>"Oh! poh! there you're again: you must live in
Charleston a year or two, but you'll have to be careful
at first that you don't fall in love with some of our
bright gals, and think they're white, before you know
it. It doesn't matter seven coppers who they're got
by, there's no distinction among niggers in Charleston.
I'll put you through some of the bright houses when
we get up, and show you some scions of our aristocracy,
that are the very worst cases. It's a fact,
Cap, these little shoots of the aristocracy <orig>invari-</orig>
               <pb n="50"/>
ably make bad niggers. If a fellow wants a real
prime, likely nigger wench, he must get the pure
African blood. As they say themselves, 'Wherever
Buckra-man bin, make bad nigger.'"</p>
            <p>"Well, Pilot, I think we've had enough about
mixed niggers for the present. Tell me! do you
really think they'll give me trouble with my steward?
He certainly is not a black man, and a better fellow
never lived," inquired the Captain earnestly. </p>
            <p>"Nothing else, Cap," said the pilot. "It's a hard
law, I <emph>tell you</emph>, and if our merchants and business
men had a say in it, 'twouldn't last long; ye
can't pass him off for a white man nohow, for the
thing's '<emph>contrary to law</emph>,' and pays so well that them
contemptible land-sharks of officers make all the fuss
about it, and never let one pass. Just take the infernal
fees off, and nobody'd trouble themselves about
the stewards. It all goes into old Grimshaw's pocket,
and he'd skin a bolt-rope for the grease, and sell the
steward if he could get a chance. He has sold a
much nearer relation. I'm down upon the law, you'll
see, Cap, for I know it plays the dickens with our
business, and is a curse to the commerce of the port.
Folks what a'n't acquainted with shipping troubles,
and a shipowner's interests, think such things are
very small affairs. But it's the name that affects us,
and when an owner stands at every item in the disbursements,
and a heavy bill for keeping his steward,
and another for filling his place, or boarding-house
accommodations, and then be deprived of his services,
he makes a wry face, and either begins to think
about another port, or making the rate of freight in
proportion to the annoyance. It has an effect that
we feel, but don't say much about. I'm a secessionist,<pb n="51"/>
but I don't believe in running mad after politics, and
letting our commercial interests suffer."</p>
            <p>"But what if I prove my steward a'n't a colored
man?" said the Captain; "they surely won't give me
any trouble then. It would pain my feelings very
much to see Manuel locked up in a cell for no crime;
and then to be deprived of his services, is more than
I can stand. If I'd known it before, I'd suffered the
torments of thirst, and put for a port farther north."</p>
            <p>"It'll cost more than it's worth," said the pilot.
"Take my plain advice, Cap; never try that; our lawyers
are lusty fellows upon fees; and the feller'd rot
in that old nuisance of a jail afore you'd get him out.
The process is so slow and entangled, nobody'd know
how to bring the case, and ev'ry lawyer'd have an
opinion of his own. But the worst of all is that it's
so unpopular, you can't get a lawyer worth seven
cents to undertake it. It would be as dangerous as
an attempt to extricate a martyr from the burning
flames. Public opinion in Charleston is controlled
by politicians; and an attempt to move in a thing so
unpopular would be like a man attempting to speak,
with pistols and swords pointed to his head."</p>
            <p>"Then it's folly to ask justice in your city, is it?"
asked the Captain. "But your people are generous,
a'n't they? and treat strangers with a courtesy that
marks the character of every high-minded society?"</p>
            <p>"Yes!—but society in South Carolina has nothing
to do with the law; our laws are gloriously ancient.
I wish, Cap, I could only open your ideas to the way
our folks manage their own affairs. I'm opposed to
this law that imprisons stewards, because it affects
commerce, but then our other laws are tip-top. It was
the law that our legislature made to stop free niggers<pb n="52"/>
from coming from the abolition States to destroy the
affections of our slaves. Some say, the construction
given to it and applied to stewards of foreign vessels
a'n't legal, and wasn't intended; but now it's controlled
by popular will,—the stewards a'n't legislators,
and the judges know it wouldn't be popular, and
there's nobody dare meddle with it, for fear he may
be called an abolitionist. You better take my advice,
Cap: ship the nigger, and save yourself and Consul
Mathew the trouble of another fuss," continued the
pilot.</p>
            <p>"That I'll never do! I've made up my mind to try
it, and won't be driven out of a port because the
people stand in fear of a harmless man. If they have
any souls in them, they'll regard with favor a poor
sailor driven into their port in distress. I've sailed
nearly all over the world, and I never got among a
people yet that wouldn't treat a shipwrecked sailor
with humanity. Gracious God! I've known savages
to be kind to poor shipwrecked sailors, and to share
their food with them. I can't, pilot, imagine a civilization
so degraded, nor a public so lost to common
humanity, as to ill treat a man in distress. We've
said enough about it for the present. I'll appeal to
Mr. Grimshaw's feelings, when I get to the city; and
I know, if he's a man, he'll let Manuel stay on board,
if I pledge my honor that he won't leave the craft."</p>
            <p>"Humph!—If you knew him as well as I do, you'd
save your own feelings. His sympathies don't run
that way," said the pilot.</p>
            <p>The Janson had now crossed the bar, and was fast
approaching Fort Sumpter. Manuel had overheard
enough of the conversation to awaken fears for his
own safety. Arising from the mattrass, in a manner<pb n="53"/>
indicating his feeble condition, he called Tommy, and
walking forward, leaned ,over the rail near the fore-rigging,
and inquired what the Captain and the
pilot were talking about. Observing his fears, the
little fellow endeavoured to quiet him by telling him
they were talking about bad sailors.</p>
            <p>"I think it is me they are talking about. If they
sell me for slave in Charleston, I'll kill myself before
a week," said he in his broken English.</p>
            <p>"What's that you say, Manuel?" inquired the first
mate as he came along, clearing up the decks with
the men.</p>
            <p>"Pilot tell Captain they sell me for slave in
South Carolina. I'd jump overboard 'fore I suffer
him," said he.</p>
            <p>"Oh, poh! don't be a fool; you a'n't among
Patagonians, Manuel; you won't have to give 'em leg
for your life. They dont sell foreigners and outlandish
men like you for slaves in Carolina—it's only
black folks what can't clothe the'r words in plain
English. Yer copper-colored hide wouldn't be worth
a sixpence to a nigger-trader—not even to old Norman
Gadsden, that I've heard 'em tell so much about in
the Liverpool docks. He's a regular Jonathan Wild
in nigger-dealing; his name's like a fiery dragon
among the niggers all over the South; and I hearn
our skipper say once when I sailed in a liner, that
niggers in Charleston were so 'fraid of him they'd
run, like young scorpions away from an old he-devil,
when they saw him coming. He sells white niggers,
as they call 'em, and black niggers—any thing that
comes in his way, in the shape of saleable folks. But
he won't acknowledge the corn when he goes away
from home, and swears there's two Norman Gadsdens<pb n="54"/>
in Charleston; that he a'n't <emph>the one!</emph> When a
man's ashamed of his name abroad, his trade must
be very bad at home, or I'm no sailor," said the
mate.</p>
            <p>"Ah, my boys!" said the pilot in a quizzical
manner, as he came to where several of the men were
getting the larboard anchor ready to let go,—"if old
Norman Gadsden gets hold of you, you're a gone
sucker. A man what's got a bad nigger has only
got to say Old Gadsden to him, and it's equal to fifty
paddles<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>The mode of punishment
most modern, and adopted in all the
workhouses and places of punishment in South Carolina, is with
the paddle, a wooden instrument in, the shape of a baker's peel;
with a blade from three to five inches wide, and from eight to ten
long. This is laid on the posteriors—generally by constables or
officers connected with the police. Holes are frequently bored in
the blade, which gives the application a sort of percussive effect;
The pain is much more acute than with the cowhide; and several
instances are known where a master ordered an amount of strokes
beyond the endurance of the slave, and it proved fatal.</p>
               </note>
at the workhouse. They tell a pretty good
story about the old fellow. I don't know if it's true,
but the old fellow's rich now, and he does just what
he pleases. It was that somebody found one of those
little occasional droppings of the aristocracy, very
well known among the secrets of the chivalry, and
called foundlings, nicely fixed up in a basket.—It's
among the secrets though, and mustn't be told abroad.—-The
finders labelled it, 'Please sell to the highest
bidder,' and left it at his door. There was a fund of
ominous meaning in the label; but Norman very
coolly took the little helpless pledge under his charge,
and, with the good nursing of old <hi>Bina</hi>, made him tell
to the tune of two hundred and thirty, cash, 'fore he<pb n="55"/>
was two year old. He went by the name of Thomas
Norman, the Christian division of his foster-father's,
according to custom. The old fellow laughs at the
joke, as he calls it, and tells 'em, when they stick it
to him, they don't understand the practice of making
money. You must keep a bright look out for him,
Manuel—you'll know him by the niggers running
when they see him coming."</p>
            <p>The pilot now returned to the quarter, and commenced
dilating upon the beauty of Charleston harbor
and its tributaries, the Astley and Cooper Rivers—then
upon the prospects of fortifications to beat the
United States in the event of South Carolina's
seceding and raising an independent sovereignty,
composed of her best blood. The Captain listened
to his unsolicited and uninteresting exposition of
South Carolina's prowess in silence, now and then
looking up at the pilot and nodding assent. He saw
that the pilot was intent upon astonishing him with
his wonderful advancement in the theory of government,
and the important position of South Carolina.
Again he looked dumbfounded, as much as to
acknowledge the pilot's profundity, and exclaimed,
"Well! South Carolina must be a devil of a State:
every thing seems captivated with its greatness: I'd
like to live in Carolina if I didn't get licked."</p>
            <p>"By scissors! that you would, Captain; you ha'n't
an idee what a mighty site our people can do if they're
a mind to! All South Carolina wants is her constitutional
rights, which her great men fought for in
the Revolution. We want the freedom to protect our
own rights and institutions—not to be insulted and
robbed by the General Government and the abolitionists."</p>
            <pb n="56"/>
            <p>"Do you practice as a people upon the same principles
that you ask of the General Government!" inquired
the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Certainly, Captain, as far as it was intended for
the judicious good of all <emph>white</emph> citizens!"</p>
            <p>"Then you claim a right for the whites, but withhold
the right when it touches on the dark side. You'll
have to lick the Federal Government, as you call it,
for they won't cut the constitution up to suit your
notions of black and white."  *    *    *</p>
            <p>"That's just the thing, Cap, and we can do it <emph>just</emph>
as easy as we now protect our own laws, and exterminate
the niggers what attempt insurrections. South
Carolina sets an example, sir, of honor and bravery
that can't be beat. Why, just look a-yonder, Cap:
the Federal Government owns this 'er Fort Sumpter,
and they insulted us by building it right in our teeth,
so that they could command the harbor, block out our
commerce, and collect the duties down here. But,
Cap, this don't scare South Carolina nohow. We
can show 'em two figures in war tactics that'd blow
'em to thunder. Ye see yonder!" said he, with an
earnest look of satisfaction, pointing to the south,
"That's Morris Island. We'd take Fort Moultrie
for a breakfast spell, and then we'd put it to 'em
hot and strong from both sides, until they'd surrender
Fort Sumpter. They couldn't stand it from both
sides. Yes, sir, they shut Fort Moultrie against us,
and wouldn't let us have it to celebrate independence
in. There's a smouldering flame in South Carolina
that'll burst forth one of these days in a way that
must teach the Federal Government some astonishing
and exciting lessons. There's old Castle Pinckney,
sir; we could keep it for a reserve, and with<pb n="57"/>
Generals Quattlebum and Commander, from Georgetown
and Santee Swamp, we could raise an army
of Palmetto regiments that would whip the Federal
Government troop and gun-boat."</p>
            <p>We have given this singular conversation of the
pilot with a strange Captain, which at the time was
taken as an isolated case of gasconade peculiar to
the man; but which the Captain afterward found to
harmonize in sentiment, feeling, and expression with
the general character of the people—the only exceptions
being the colored people.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <head type="sub">ARRIVAL OF THE JANSON.</head>
            <p>ABOUT five o'clock on the evening of the 23d, the
Janson passed Castle Pinckney, ran up to the wharf
with the flood-tide, let go her anchor, and commenced
warping into the dock. Her condition attracted sundry
persons to the end of the wharf, who viewed her
with a sort of commiseration that might have been
taken for sincere feeling. The boarding officer had
received her papers, and reported her character and
condition, which had aroused a feeling of speculative
curiosity, that was already beginning to spread
among ship-carpenters and outfitters.</p>
            <p>Conspicuous among those gathered on the wharf
was a diminutive little dandy, with an olive-colored
frock-coat, black pants, embroidered vest, and an
enormous shirt-collar that endangered his ears. This
was secured around the neck with a fancy neckcloth,
very tastefully set off with a diamond pin, He was
very slender, with a narrow, feminine face, round
popeyes—requiring the application of a pocket-glass every
few minutes—and very fair complexion, with little
positive expression of character in his features. His
nose was pointed; his chin, projected and covered
with innumerable little pimples, gave an irregular
and mastiff-shaped mouth a peculiar expression. He
wore a very highly-polished and high-heeled pair of
boots, and a broad-brimmed, silk-smooth hat. He
seemed very anxious to display the beauty of two<pb n="59"/>
diamond rings that glittered upon his delicate little
fingers, made more conspicuous by the wristbands of
his shirt. Standing in a very conspicuous place upon
the capsill of the wharf, he would rub his hands, then
running from one part of the wharf to another, ordering
sundry niggers about making fast the lines,
kicking one, and slapping another, as he stooped, with
his little hand. All paid respect to him. The Captain
viewed him with a smile of curiosity, as much
as to say, "What important specimen of a miss in
breeches is that?" But when the little fellow spoke,
the secret was told. He gathered the inflections of
his voice, as if he were rolling them over the little
end of a thunderbolt in his mouth. As the vessel
touched the wharf, he sprang to the corner and cried
out at the top of his voice, "Yer' <emph>welcome to Charleston</emph>,
Captain Thompson! Where did you get that
knocking?—where are ye bound for?—how many
days are you out?—how long has she leaked in that
way?" and a strain of such questions, which it would
be impossible to trace, such was the rapidity with
which he put them. The Captain answered him in
accordance with the circumstances; and supposing
him clothed with authority, inquired where he should
find some hands to work his pumps, in order to
relieve his men. "By-Je-w-hu! Captain, you must
a' had a piping time, old feller. Oh! yes, you want
help to work your pumps. Get niggers, Captain,
there's lots on 'em about here. They're as thick as
grasshoppers in a cotton-patch."</p>
            <p>"Yes, but I want 'em now, my men are worn out;
I must get some Irishmen, if I can't get others at
once," said the Captain, viewing his man again from
head to foot.</p>
            <pb n="60"/>
            <p>"Oh! don't employ Paddies, Captain; 'ta'n't popular;
they don't belong to the secession party;
Charleston's overrun with them and the Dutch! Why,
she won't hurt to lay till to-morrow morning, and
there'll be lots o' niggers down; they can't be out
after bell-ring without a pass, and its difficult to find
their masters after dark. Haul her up 'till she
grounds, and she won't leak when the tide leaves her.
We can go to the theatre and have a right good supper
after, at Baker's or the St. Charles's. It's the way
our folks live. We live to enjoy ourselves in South
Carolina. Let the old wreck go to-night." The little
fellow seemed so extremely polite, and so anxious
to "do the genteel attention," that the Captain
entirely forgot the tenor of his conversation
with the pilot, while his feelings changed with the
prospect of such respectful attention; and yet he
seemed at a loss how to analyze the peculiar character
of his little, pedantic friend.</p>
            <p>"You must not think me intrusive, Captain," said
he, pulling out his segar-pouch and presenting it with
at Chesterfieldian politeness. "It's a pleasure we
Carolinians take in being hospitable and attentive to
strangers. My name, sir, is ——! My niggers call
me Master George. Yes, sir! our family!—you
have heard of my father probably—he belongs to
one of the best stocks in Carolina—owns a large interest
in this wharf, and is an extensive cotton-broker,
<hi>factors</hi>, we call them here—and he owns a large plantation
of niggers on Pee-Dee; you must visit our
plantation. Captain, certain! before you leave the
city. But you mustn't pay much attention to the
gossip you'll hear about the city. I pledge you my<pb n="61"/>
honor, sir, it don't amount to any thing, nor has it
any prominent place in our society."</p>
            <p>"Really, sir," replied the Captain, "I shall do
myself the honor to accept of your hospitable kindness,
and hope it may be my good fortune to reciprocate
at some future day. I'm only too sorry that
our wrecked condition affords me no opportunity to
invite you to my table to-night; but the circumstances
which you see everywhere presenting themselves are
my best apology."</p>
            <p>"Oh, dear me! don't mention it, I pray, Captain.
Just imagine yourself perfectly at home. We will
show you what Southern hospitality is. We don't go
upon the Yankee system of Mr. <hi>So-and-so</hi> and
<hi>What-do-ye-call-'um</hi>. Our feelings are in keeping with our
State pride, which, with our extreme sensibility of
honor, forbids the countenance of meanness. South
Carolinians, sir, are at the very top of the social
ladder—awake to every high-minded consideration of
justice and right. We are not moved by those morbid
excitements and notions that so often lead people
away at the North. Make no unnecessary preparation,
Captain, and I will do myself the honor to call upon
you in an hour." Thus saying, he shook his hand
and left.</p>
            <p>The pilot had delivered his charge safe, and was
about to, bid the Captain good-by for the night. But
in order to do the thing in accordance with an English
custom, that appears to have lost none of its zest
in South Carolina, he was invited into the Captain's
cabin to take a little prime <emph>old</emph> Jamaica. Manuel,
who had somewhat recovered, brought out the case
from a private locker, and setting it before them, they
filled up, touched glasses, and drank the usual <orig>stand-</orig>
               <pb n="62"/>
ing toast to South Carolina. "Pilot," said the Captain,
"who is my polite friend—he seems a right
clever little fellow?"</p>
            <p>"Well, Captain, he's little, but he's first-rate blood,
and a genuine sprig of the chivalry. He's a devil
of a secessionist, sir. If ye were to hear that fellow
make a stump speech on States' rights, you'd think
him a Samson on Government. His father is the
head of a good mercantile house here; 'twouldn't be
a bad idea to consign to him. But I must bid you
good-night, Captain; I'll call and see you to-morrow,"
said the pilot, leaving for his home.</p>
            <p>The Janson was hauled well up the dock, and
grounded on the ebb-tide. Manuel prepared supper
for the officers and crew, while the Captain awaited
the return of his new acquaintance. "Captain,"
said Manuel, "I should like to go ashore to-night
and take a walk, for my bones are sore, and I'm full
of pains. I think it will do me good. You don't
think anybody will trouble me, if I walk peaceably
along?"</p>
            <p>"Nobody would trouble you if they knew you,
Manuel; but I am afraid they will mistake you in the
night. You had better keep ship until morning; take
a good rest, and to-morrow will be a fine day—you
can then take some exercise."</p>
            <p>Manuel looked at the Captain as if he read something
doubtful in his countenance, and turned away
with a pitiful look of dissatisfaction. It seems that
through his imperfect knowledge of English, he had
misconceived the position of the celebrated Thomas
Norman Gadsden, whom he imagined to be something
like an infernal machine, made and provided by the
good citizens of Charleston to catch bad niggers.<pb n="63"/>
"Nora-ma Gazine no catch-e me, Cap-i-tan, if me
go ashore, 'case me no make trouble in no part de
world where me sail, Oh! no, Cap-i-tan, Manuel
know how to mine dis bisness," said he returning
again to the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Yes, yes, Manuel, but we can't let the crew go
ashore 'till we get through the custom-house; you
must content yourself to-night, and in the morning
'twill be all right. I'm afraid you'll get sick again—the
night-air is very bad in this climate; old Gadsden
won't trouble you. He don't walk about at
night."</p>
            <p>Manuel walked forward, not very well satisfied
with the manner in which the Captain put him off.
The latter felt the necessity of caution, fearing he
might infringe upon some of the municipal regulations
that the pilot had given him an account of, which
accounted for his refusal Manuel sat upon the main-hatch
fondling Tommy, and telling him what good
things they would have in the morning for breakfast,
and how happy they ought to be that they were not
lost during the gales, little thinking that he was to
be the victim of a merciless law, which would confine
him within the iron grates of a prison before the
breakfast hour in the morning. "I like Charleston,
Tommy," said Manuel; "it looks like one of our old
English towns, and the houses have such pretty gardens,
and the people they say are all so rich and live
so fine. Tommy, we'll have a long walk and look all
around it, so that we can tell the folks when we get
home. The ship, owes me eleven pounds, and I mean
to take some good things home for presents, to show
what they have in South Carolina."</p>
            <p>"You better buy a young nigger, and take him<pb n="64"/>
home as a curiosity to show among the Highlands.
You can buy a young Sambo for any price, just the
same as you would a leg of mutton at the butcher's;
put him in a band-box, lug him across, and you'll
make a fortune in the North country. But I'd rather
buy a young wife, for the young niggers are more
roguish than a lot o' snakes, and al'a's eat their heads
off afore they're big enough to toddle. They sell gals
here for niggers whiter than you are, Manuel; they
sell 'em at auction, and then they sell corn to feed
'em on. Carolina's a great region of supersensual
sensibility; they give you a wife of any color or
beauty, and don't charge you much for her, providing
you're the right stripe. What a funny thing it would
be to show the Glasgow folks a bright specimen of a
bought wife from the renowned State of South Carolina,
with genuine aristocratic blood in her veins;
yes, a pure descendant of the Huguenots!" said the
mate, who was leaning over the rail where Manuel
and Tommy were seated, smoking a segar and viewing
the beautiful scenery around the harbor.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" said Manuel, "when I get a wife and live
on shore, I don't want to buy one—it might be a dangerous
bargain. Might buy the body, but not the
soul—that's God's."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">A NEW DISH OF SECESSION.</head>
            <p>ABOUT a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening,
Master George, as he called himself, the little pedantic
man, came skipping down the wharf. As soon as
he approached the brig, he cried out at the top of his
voice, "Captain! Captain!!"</p>
            <p>The Captain stepped to the gangway, and the little
fellow, who had stood crossing and working his
fingers, reached out his hand to assist him ashore.
This done, he took the Captain's arm, and commencing
a discourse upon the wonderful things and people
of South Carolina they wended their way to the
Charleston Theatre. The company then performing
was a small affair, and the building itself perfectly
filthy, and filled with an obnoxious stench. The play
was a little farce, which the Captain had seen to
much perfection in his own country, and which required
some effort of mind to sit out its present mutilation.
Yet, so highly pleased was <emph>Master</emph> George,
that he kept up a succession of applauses at every
grimace made by the comedian. Glad when the first
piece was over, the Captain made a motion to adjourn
to the first good bar-room and have a punch. It was
agreed, upon the condition that the little man should
"do the honor," and that they should return and see
the next piece out. The Captain, of course, yielded
to the rejoinder, though it was inflicting a severe
penalty upon his feelings. There was another piece<pb n="66"/>
to come yet, which the little fellow's appetite was
as ready to devour as the first. The Captain, seeing
this, could not refrain expressing his surprise. This
was taken as a charge against his taste, and George immediately
commenced a discussion upon the subject
of the piece, the intention of the author, and the
merits of the principal performers, whose proper
adaptation he admired. The Captain knew his subject,
and instead of contending in detail, advised
him to take a peep into the theatres of New York
and London. Not to be undone, for he was like all
little men, who insist upon the profoundness of their
own opinions, he asserted that it could be only the
different views which individuals entertained of delineating
character, and that the Charlestonians were
proverbially correct in their judgment of music and
dramatic performances.</p>
            <p>"I pity the judgment that would award merit to
such a performance as that," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"How strange, that you Englishmen and Scotchmen
always find fault with every thing we Americans
do. Your writers manifest it in their books upon us
and the people seem of necessity to copy from them,
and echo their grumblings," rejoined Master George.</p>
            <p>"You judge from the common saying, instead of a
knowledge front observation, I fear," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Lord, sir! you must not judge me by that rule.
Carolinians, sir, always appreciate intelligent strangers,
for they always exert a healthy influence, and
never meddle with our institutions; so you see it
wouldn't do to follow the pestilent notions of petty
scribblers, lest we should form wrong opinions."</p>
            <p>"But tell me," said the Captain, "do you consider<pb n="67"/>
yourselves Americans in South Carolina?—the pilot
must have led me astray."</p>
            <p>"Americans! yes, indeed, the true blood at that,
and no man of tip-top judgment ever questioned it.
But you must mark the difference; we <emph>ha'n't</emph> Yankees,
nor we don't believe in their infernal humbuggery
about abolition. If it wasn't for South Carolina
and Georgia, the New-Englanders would starve
for want of our cotton and rice. It's the great staple
what keeps the country together; and as much as
they talk about it, just take that away, and what
would the United States be? We South Carolinians
give no symptoms or expressions of what we mean to
do that we cannot maintain. We have been grossly
insulted by the Federal Government, but it dar'n't
come at us and just give us a chance at fair fight.
We'd show 'em the thunder of the Palmetto, that they'd
never trouble our sovereignty again. Captain, I pledge
you my honor that if there wasn't so many infernal
Yankees in Georgia, and she'd follow our lead in
secession, we'd just lick the whole North. Georgia's
a big State, but she a'n't pluck, and has no chivalry
at all among her people. She allows such privileges
to them Yankees—gives them power to control her
manufacturing interests—and this is just what will
uproot the foundation of their slave institution.
Georgians a'n't a bit like us; first, they are too plebeian
in their manners—have no bond of guardianship
for their laws, and exert no restraints for the
proper protection of good society. But, Captain,
their stock has a different origin, and the peculiarity
which now marks our character may be traced to the
offspring of early settlement. We derived our character
and sentiments from the Huguenots; they,<pb n="68"/>
from an uncharacterized class of coarse adventurers,
whose honesty was tinctured with penal suspicion.
This, sir, accounts for the differences so marked in
our character."</p>
            <p>The little fellow pressed this kind of conversation
in the lobby of the theatre, and at the same time took
the very particular pleasure of introducing the Captain
to several of the young bloods, as he called
them, while they walked to and from the boxes.
At length the Captain found himself in a perfect
hornet's nest, surrounded by vicious young secessionists,
so perfectly nullified in the growth that they
were all ready to shoulder muskets, pitchforks, and
daggers, and to fire pistols at poor old Uncle Sam,
if he should poke his nose in South Carolina. The
picture presented was that of an unruly set of children
dictating their opinions to a hoary-headed old
daddy—accusing him of pragmatism, and threatening,
if he was twice as old, they'd whip him unless he did
as they directed. The knowledge of South Carolina's
power and South Carolina's difficulties with the Federal
Government he found so universally set forth
as to form the atmosphere of conversation in the parlor,
the public-house, the school and the bar-room,
the lecture-room and the theatre.</p>
            <p>The little man extended his invitation to a party
of the bloods. The Captain was taken by the arms
in a kind of bond fellowship, and escorted into
Baker's eating-saloon, a place adjacent to the
theatre, and, to a man unaccustomed to the things
that are in Charleston, a very rowdy place. This is
considered by Charlestonians one of the finest places
in the Southern country; where good suppers and
secession (<emph>the all-engrossing subjects with</emph> 
               <orig>
                  <emph>Charles-</emph>
               </orig>
               <pb n="69"/>
               <emph>tonians</emph>) form the only important element of conversation.
It may be set down as a fact, that among
seven-tenths of the people of Charleston, the standard
of a gentleman is measured according to his knowledge
of secession and his ability to settle the question
of hot suppers. We say nothing of that vigorous
patriotism so often manifested in a long string of
fulsome toasts that disgrace the columns of the Mercury
and Courier.</p>
            <p>At Baker's the place was literally crowded with all
kinds and characters, graded from the honorable
judge down to the pot-boy; a pot-pouri of courtesy
and companionship only exhibited in England on the
near approach of elections. The reader may think
this strange, but we can assure him that distinctions
are strangely maintained; an exclusive arrogance
being observed in private life, while a too frequent
and general resort to bar-rooms has established
plebeianism in public. Voices were sounding at all
parts of the counter, and for as many different voices
as many different mixtures were named. The
Captain received a great many introductions, and
almost as many invitations to drink; but the little
man, Master George, claimed the exclusive honor,
and keeping an eye wide awake, took the advantage
of his own dimensions, and began working his way
through a barricade of bodies and elbows, until he
had reached the counter. His party followed close,
at his heels. Altogether, they called for cocktails,
smashes, toddies, cobblers, juleps, and legitimates.
These disposed of, the company repaired to what is
called a "box up-stairs." Scarcely seated, Master
George rang the bell with such violence that he disjointed
the cord and tassel, and gave such an alarm<pb n="70"/>
that three or four darkies came poking their alarmed
countenances through the curtains at once. </p>
            <p>"There's nothing like making the fellows mind;
they've got so infernal independent here, and old
Tom thinks so much of his young wife, that his
niggers have begun to imitate him. One's enough
at a time!" said Master George, with all the importance
of his character. A "bright boy," with his
hair nicely parted on the middle of his head, and
frizzed for the occasion, made a polite bow, while the
others retired.</p>
            <p>"What have you choice for supper, to-night? We
want something ripe for the palate—none of your
leavings, now, you infernal nigger, and don't tell us
none of your lies."</p>
            <p>"Birds, sir, grouse, woodcock, partridge, canvas-backs,
and quails; meats, venison, and oysters,
master—did up in any shape what the gentlemen
wish. Wines, &amp;c., if they want," replied the servant,
without any of the negro dialect, at the same time
making a low bow to Master George.</p>
            <p>"Name it! name your dishes, gentlemen! Don't
be backward. I suppose his birds are as usual, without
age to flavor them. It's perfectly heathenish to eat
birds as they are served here: we never get a bird
here that is sufficiently changed to suit a gentleman
o' taste; their beef's tough, and such steak as they
make is only fit for shoemakers and blacksmiths. I
never come into the place but I think of my journey
in France, where they know the style and taste of a
gentleman, and things are served to suit your choice."
Thus our little friend continued his connoisseur
remarks, to give the Captain a particular idea of his
proficiency in the requisite qualities, age, and time<pb n="71"/>
of keeping necessary to make the adjuncts of a
supper fit for a gentleman. "D——me! we don't
know when edibles are choice, and the Yankees are
perfect brutes in these things, and have no more
taste than a cow. Our folks ought to all go to
France for a year or two, to learn the style of cooking.
It's perfect murder to eat a bird the very day
after it's killed; yes, sir! no man that considers his
stomach will do it," said George.</p>
            <p>The servant waited impatiently—the Captain rubbed
his eyes, and began to pour out a glass of water;
and dryly said he'd no choice, which was responded
to by the rest. It was left to Master George, and
he ordered a bountiful supply of grouse, partridges,
oyster, and champagne of his favourite brand—none
other. There was also a billiard-room, reading-room,
a room for <emph>more important</emph> gambling, and a bar-room,
up-stairs. All these were well filled with very well-dressed
and very noisy people; the latter being a
very convenient place, the party sent to it for tipplers
to fill up time.</p>
            <p>"This is but a small portion of what constitutes
life in Charleston, Captain. We live for living's sake,
and don't stand upon those blueskin theories of
temperance and religion that Yankees do, and blame
the Father of generations for not making the world
better. I never saw one of them that wasn't worse
than we Southerners before he'd been in Charleston
a year, and was perfect death on niggers. Yes, sir,
it's only the extreme goodness of the Southern
people's hearts that makes the niggers like them
so. I never saw a Northerner yet that wouldn't
work his niggers to death in two years. D——me,
sir, my servants all love me as if I was a prince.<pb n="72"/>
Have you ever been in France, sir?" said he, suddenly
breaking off. The Captain replied in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>"Ah! then you can speak French! the most
polished language known to refined society. I
wouldn't part with my French for the world. All
the first families in Charleston are familiar with it.
It's the modern gentleman's curt-blanche to
society here. There's no language like it for beauty
and flexibility; but one must go to France and learn
to acquire its grace and ease," said he, in rapid
succession, rolling out his words in imitation of a
London sprig of the Inner Temple, and working his
little mastiff mouth.</p>
            <p>"No, sir," said the Captain quaintly. "I never
stopped long enough in France to get hold of the
lingo."</p>
            <p>"God bless me, what a misfortune! and can't
speak it yet, ah? Why, Captain, if you wanted to
court a petité madmoselle, you'd be in a sad
fix—she wouldn't understand what you were talking about
and would take your love-pledges for gammon."</p>
            <p>"You're mistaken there, my good fellow. Love
grows on trees in France, and a French woman can
see it. before you begin to tell her about it!" retorted
the Captain, which brought a "<emph>Good! good!</emph> hit him
again!" from the whole party. At this, Master
George commenced reading the Captain a disquisition
upon the best mode of acquiring the French
language. Supper was brought—in old Tom Baker's
best flourish—and the party begun to discuss its
merits with great gusto. What the little, chivalrous
fellows lacked in physical dimension, they made up
in patriotic sentiment in behalf of the grand <orig>sove-</orig>
               <pb n="73"/>
reignty of South Carolina, which they continued to
pour out until a late hour, every man backing his
sayings by the authority of the great and wonderful
Calhoun.</p>
            <p>The Captain sat eating away, and seeming more
disposed to enjoy the physical consolation of his supper
than to elevate his ideas upon South Carolina's
politics.</p>
            <p>"Now, Captain," said Master George, in a very
serious tone, after he had been striking his hand
upon the marble table for more than an hour to
confirm the points of his reasoning,—"what is your
opinion of the great question at issue between the
Federal Government and South Carolina? And what
do you think of the Old Dominion? how will she
stand upon the test-question?"</p>
            <p>The poor Captain looked confounded—took another
oyster, and began to get his mouth. in a fix, while
little George worked his fingers through his nice curly
hair, and the young bloods awaited the rejoinder
with anxiety.</p>
            <p>"Really, sir, you have the advantage of me in
your question. It is so much beyond my profession
that I am entirely ignorant of the subject—therefore
could not give an opinion. In truth, sir, I do not
know the purport of the question. It has given me
pleasure and information to listen to your conversation
and the ability you displayed in argument, but,
as a stranger, I could take no part," replied the
Captain very sincerely.</p>
            <p>Not content with this, Master George wished to
be more direct. "It's the right of secession, Captain—the
power to maintain the right by the constitution."</p>
            <p>"Probably; but may I expose my ignorance by<pb n="74"/>
inquiring what is meant by secession? and to what it
is applied so frequently?" inquired the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Oh! murder Captain; have you never heard of
nullification times! Well, sir, you must be posted on
the affairs of our government." So he commenced
an analysis of nearly an hour long, and in it gave
some astonishing accounts of the wonderful statesmanship
of Calhoun, Butler, and Rhett, tapering
down with a perfect fire-and-thunder account of the
military exploits of General Quattlebum and Captain
Blanding. The Captain began to stretch and gape,
for he labored under the fatigue of a perilous voyage,
and repose was the only sovereign remedy. He felt
that the limits of propriety were entirely overstepped,
and that he would have reason to remember the first
night spent with little George the secessionist.</p>
            <p>"But, Captain! my dear fellow. I see you don't
understand our position yet. We've been insulted;
yes, most rascally insulted by the Federal Government,
and they keep it up every year. We can't get
our rights. Oh! no, sir, there's no such thing in the
knowledge of the Federal officers as justice for South
Carolina; and you must understand, Captain, that she
is the greatest State in the Union, and there a'n't
nothing like her people for bravery. The political
power's got North and West, the old constitution is
being dissected to suit the abolitionists, and they're
drawing the cordon around us faster and faster; and
they're now out like a warrior boldly to the conquest,
sounding their voices in the halls of Congress, appealing
to human and divine power to protect their
nonsense, and bidding defiance to our constitutional
rights, Our slaves are our property, protected by
the law of God—by that inspired and superhuman<pb n="75"/>
wisdom that founded our great and glorious constitution.
Yes, sir! it was an institution entailed
upon us by our forefathers, and a wise providence has
provided proper laws by which we shall protect and
see these poor miserable devils of helpless slaves, that
can't take care of themselves, straight through."</p>
            <p>"But how does this affect you and the Federal
Government?" inquired the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Why, sir, most directly!" replied Master George,
screwing his mouth and giving his head a very learned
attitude. "Directly, sir!—the Federal Government
is acquiescing in every abolition scheme that is put
forward by that intriguing Northern compact for the
establishment of new governments in the territories.
She is granting unconstitutional privileges to designing
politicians, whose chief aim is to uproot our domestic
institution and destroy the allegiance of the
slave to his master, by which the slaves would be cast
upon the world unprotected, and we disarmed of power
to protect them. Ah! sir, I tell you, of all fruits
of the imagination that would be the most damnable,
and the slave would be the sufferer. It would be
worse for him, poor fellow; it would be an abuse of
human power without precedent. So far as political
power is concerned, we are nearly disarmed. The
influx of population finds its way into the opened
avenues of the North and West. And with opinions
predisposed against our institutions, and the contaminating
influence standing ready with open arms to
embrace the great current, what can we expect?
It's the increasing power made by foreign influx that's
giving tone to our government. If our Southern
Convention stand firm we are saved; but I'm fearful
there's too many doubtful shadows in it that won't<pb n="76"/>
stand to the gun. That's what's always played the
devil with us," said George, striking his hand upon the
table. "There's no limitation to their interpositions,
and their resolves, and their adjournments; which
don't come up to my principles of making the issue,
and standing to the question with our coffins on our
backs. These condescensions of thought and feeling
arise from the misconceived notions of a few, who are
always ready to join, but never willing to march to
action, and must not be taken as a specimen of South
Carolina bravery. The Federal Government has become
vicious and even puerile toward South Carolina;
and since the Herculean power of the great Calhoun
is gone, it treats us like a semi-barbarous and secluded
people, mistaking our character. But we'll learn
the Federal Government a lesson yet."</p>
            <p>"Do not your legislators make laws for your government,
or how is it that you express such a restive
dissatisfaction? Do not the same laws which govern
you, govern the whole of the slave States?"</p>
            <p>Little George had previously monopolized all the
conversation, but at this juncture five or six voices
broke out, each fired with a reply to the Captain's
question; and yet the answer was of the same old
stamp: What South Carolina had done—how she had
fought and gained the Mexican war—how she was
interested in slaves, and how she yet feared to strike
the blow because a set of mere adventurers had got
the power to vote in her elections, and cowards
through them had got into the legislature.</p>
            <p>"Why, gentlemen, listen to me in this particular.
If"——</p>
            <p>"Your oysters are getting cold, George," interrupted
a blood at his left, rather facetiously.</p>
            <pb n="77"/>
            <p>"I claim the respect due a gentleman, sir! A
South Carolinian will transgress no rules of etiquette,"
said George, grasping his tumbler in a passionate
manner and smashing it upon the marble slab, causing
a sudden emeute in the camp. "Order! order!
order!" was sounded from every tongue. "You mustn't
be <emph>afeard</emph>, Captain," said one of the party. "This
is perfectly South Carolinian—just the oscillating of
the champagne; it won't last long."</p>
            <p>The noise was more loud than ordinary, and brought
a score of people around to hear the trouble. George
had got in high dudgeon, and it took several persons
to hold him, while the remainder, not excepting the
Captain, were engaged in a pacification. The scene
was very extravagant in folly; and through the kind
interposition of friends, the matter was settled to the
honorable satisfaction of both parties—the question
was called for—the Captain called for a legitimate,
rubbed his eyes, and little George proceeded. "If
my friend <emph>Thomas Y. Simmons</emph>, Jr., had been elected
to the legislature he'd altered the position of things in
South Carolina. All these corruptions would have
been exposed, and the disparity of party would have
dwindled into obscurity. Every true Carolinian voted
for him to the hilt, but how was he defeated? Gentlemen,
can you answer? it will be a favor highly
gratifying to me to hear your opinions!" A voice
answered, "Because he wasn't big enough!" "No,
sir," said George, "it was because there was intrigue
in the party, and the Yankee influence went to put
him down. The world'll hear from him yet. He's
my particular friend, and will stand in the halls of
Congress as great a statesman as ever lisped a political
sentiment."</p>
            <pb n="78"/>
            <p>George's account of his particular friend, Thomas
Y. S——, Jr., was so extravagant, and not having
heard of him before, the Captain's curiosity was
aroused to know who he was and where he resided.
We will not tax the reader with George's wonderful
memoir of his friend, but merely inform him that
"<emph>little Tommy Simmons</emph>," as he is usually styled in
Charleston, is an exact pattern of Master George,
with the exception of his mouth, which is straight and
regular; and if we may be allowed to condescend to
the extremes, we should say that the cordwainer had
done more for his heels. Otherwise, no daguerreotype
could give a counterpart more correct. Tommy is a
very small member of the Charleston bar, who, though
he can seldom be seen when the court is crowded,
makes a great deal of noise without displaying power
of elucidation or legal abilities, yet always acquitting
himself cleverly. Tommy was little George in two
particulars—he had studied law, and was a great secessionist;
and if George had never practised, it was only
from inclination, which he asserted arose from a humane
feeling which he never could overcome—that
he never wished to oppress anybody. But the greatest
contrast that the reader can picture to himself
between mental and physical objects existed between
Tommy's aspirations and the physical man. His
mind was big enough, and so was his self-confidence,
to have led the Assyrian and Chaldean army against
the Hebrews. To this end, and to further the formula
of his statesmanship, no sooner was he twenty-one,
and the corner just turned, than he sounded his
war-trumpet—secession or death!—mounted the rostrum
and "<emph>stump'd</emph> it," to sound the goodness and greatness
of South Carolina, and total annihilation to all<pb n="79"/>
unbelievers in nullification. It was like Jonah and
the whale, except the swallowing, which spunky
Tommy promised should be his office, if the Federal
Government didn't toe the mark. Yes, Tommy was
a candidate for the legislature, and for the Southern
Congress, (which latter was exclusively chivalrous;)
and the reader must not be surprised when we tell
him that he lacked but a few votes of being elected
to the former. Such was the voice of the Charleston
district.</p>
            <p>Supper had been discussed down to the fragments,
and all expressed their satisfaction of the quantity
and declined any more; but George called on another
bottle of champagne, and insisted that the party
should take a parting glass. The servant had begun
to extinguish the lights—a sure sign that the success
of the bar was ended for the night. George reprimanded
the negro—the sparkling beverage was
brought, glasses filled up, touched, and drunk with
the standing toast of South Carolina. A motion to
adjourn was made and seconded, and the party, feeling
satisfied with their evening's recreation, moved off
accordingly.</p>

            <head type="sub">A FEW POINTS OF THE LAW.</head>
            <p>IN Charleston, such an adjournment at a bar-room
or an eating-house, when parties are enjoying what
is termed a "pleasant occasion," does not mean an
adjournment to the domestic fireside; nor are the
distinctions between married and single men regarded,
though domestic attachments may be considered as
governing the thoughts and feelings. The practical
definition of such an adjournment means to some
place where beauty secludes itself to waste in shame.</p>
            <p>The party descended into the lower bar-room, which,
though rather thinned, presented a picture of characters
stimulated to the tottering point. A motion
had been made and strongly seconded to visit the
voluptuous house of a certain lady, which it is considered
a stranger has not seen Charleston until he has
visited. The Captain remonstrated against this, assuring
the party that he must go to the ship and
needed rest. Again and again they insisted, setting
forth the charms and beauty of the denizens, but he
as often declined in the most positive manner. Unable
to move him in his resolution, one by one began
to give him a hearty shake of the hand and bid him
good-night, leaving little Master George to the exclusive
honor of seeing him home.</p>
            <p>Standing in the centre of the room, surrounded by
five or six persons well-dressed but very weak in the
knees, was a portly-looking gentleman; with very florid<pb n="81"/>
countenance, keen dark eyes, and aquiline nose which
he frequently fingered. There was an air of respectability
about him, though his countenance was
not marked with any particularly prominent feature
to distinguish him from the ordinary class of respectable
men. He spoke well, yet without taste or discrimination
in his language, was rather bald and gray,
with small head. and low perceptive powers; and judging
from the particular tone of his voice and. the cant
terms he used, we should think he had figured among
the Kentucky horse-traders, or made stump speeches
in Arkansas. His dress was inclined to the gaudy.
He wore a flashy brown-colored frock-coat with the
collar laid very far back, a foppish white vest exposing
his shirt-bosom nearly down to the waistbands
of his pants, which were of gray stripes. But the
more fanciful portions of his dress were a large and
costly fob-chain, which hung very low and supported
an immense seal containing a glistening stone, which
he seemed very fond of dangling with his left hand.
Attached to this was a very prominently displayed
black ribbon, answering the purpose of a guard-chain,
and laid with great contrasting care over the bosom
of his shirt. This, with a neckerchief of more flashy
colors than Joseph's coat, and a late style Parisian
hat, with the rim very exquisitely turned upon the
sides, make up our man.</p>
            <p>He was discussing politics, with a great many
sensible sayings, though nothing like close reasoning;
and strange as it may seem, he was strongly opposed
to the rabid views of several staggering secessionists,
who surrounded him, and advocated the views set
forth in convention by Mr. Butler. We remarked
this more particularly, for it was about the only<pb n="82"/>
instance we witnessed of a public man being independent
enough to denounce the fanaticism of secession.
A more amusing scene than that presented by the
attitudes—the questions in regard to South Carolina
licking the Federal Government—the strange pomp—ribald
gasconade, and high-sounding chivalry of the
worthies, cannot be imagined. They were in a
perfect ecstasy with themselves and South Carolina,
and swore, let whatever come, they were ready to
meet it.</p>
            <p>Little Master George seemed very anxious that the
Captain should become acquainted with him, and
commenced giving him a monstrous account of his
distinguished abilities. "And that's not all!" said
George; "he's not only one of the greatest characters
in Charleston, or perhaps the State, but he's a <emph>right
good fellow</emph>."</p>
            <p>We will interrupt, by informing the reader that he
was one of the <emph>good fellows</emph>—a numerous family in
Charleston—who never use fine instruments when they
select their company; and pay a large amount of
worthy tribute to the liquor-dealers. There is no
discriminating latitude attached to the <emph>good-fellow</emph>
family, for its members may be found with alike
gratifying inclinations, from the highest aristocracy
to the negro population.</p>
            <p>"That, sir, is Col. S——e; belongs to one of the
first families, sir. He can beat old Pettigru all
hollow; his eloquence is so thrilling that he always
reminds me of Pericles. He can beat little Thomas
Y. Simmons, Jr., all to pieces—make the best stump
speech—address a public assemblage, and rivet all
their minds—can make a jury cry quicker than any
other man—can clear the worst criminal that ever<pb n="83"/>
committed crime—and he's good-hearted too—can
draw the most astonishing comparisons to confound
the minds of stupid jurors, and make them believe
the d——dest nonsense that ever man invented. Yes,
sir—when he makes a speech, everybody goes to hear
him, for he says what he pleases, and old Judge
Withers, whose will is as arbitrary as Julius Cæsar's,
and has got the obstinacy of Tom Boyce's mule,
dar'n't attempt to control the tenor of his plea.
And he can tell the best invented story of any man
in town. He cleared the villanous Doctor Hines
once upon the color of his pantaloons."</p>
            <p>George waited impatiently for the end of the
political controversy, determined to introduce his
friend to the colonel. He soon had an opportunity,
for the colonel, finding himself beset by a set of
unreasonable secessionists, made a sweeping declaration.
"Gentlemen," said he, "let me tell you a
modest fact: seven-eighths of the secession fire-eaters
don't know what the proper meaning of government
is: I make the charge against my own people—but it
is true." "Traitor! traitor!—traitor to South Carolina,"
was sounded at the top of a dozen voices.</p>
            <p>"Then, if I am such in your opinions, I'm gratified
to know that my feelings are my own. Good-night!"</p>
            <p>Thus saying, he withdrew from the party, and
making his way for the door, was saluted by George,
who introduced him to his friend, the Captain. The
colonel was a very sociable, communicative man; and
taking the Captain's arm, as they walked along, entered
into an interesting conversation about his voyage
and first visit to the city, at the same time displaying
his good sense in not trying to force the great things
of South Carolina into his mind.</p>
            <pb n="84"/>
            <p>We, a few weeks afterward, had the good fortune
to hear the legal abilities of this gentleman displayed
in a plea at the bar. There were many good points
in it, which,if not legally pointed, were said well; yet
we should class him as belonging to the <emph>loud school</emph>.</p>
            <p>The Captain, thinking it a good opportunity to
make some inquiries about his steward, as they proceeded,
commenced in the following manner:</p>
            <p>Your laws are very stringent in South Carolina,
I believe, sir!"</p>
            <p>"Well, no sir," said the colonel, "if we except
those which govern the niggers; they of necessity
must be so; we have had so many emeutes with
them, that no law can be made too strict in its bearings.
We have so many bad niggers poured in upon
us, that the whole class is becoming corrupted."</p>
            <p>"Your laws, of course, make a distinction between
good and bad niggers, and free negroes?" interposed
the Captain.</p>
            <p>"We make no distinction between the colors—some
are as white as you are; but the grades are so
complex that it would be impossible to make a sliding-scale
law for any fixed complexions. The law which
governs them is distinctive and comprehensive—made
in order to shield the white population from
their ignorance of law and evidence. We never
could govern them in their respective spheres, unless
the laws were made stringent in their effect. As for
the free niggers, they're the greatest nuisance we
have; it is our policy to get rid of them, and to that
end we tax them severely. The riddance of this class
of niggers would be an essential benefit to our slaves,
as upon account of their influence our negro-laws are
made more stringent. And the worst of it is that<pb n="85"/>
they increase faster. But we make it a principal
point <emph>to get all the free men we can married to slaves</emph>,
and the free women run off. You, that are accustomed
to the free institutions of your country, may
think some of these things singular at first; but you
would soon become accustomed to them, and would
really admire them when you saw how beautifully
they worked."</p>
            <p>"Is there no discretionary power left?" inquired
the Captain. "It must be oppressive, if carried out;
Good men—whether they be white or black—are
entitled to the advantages due them; but where laws
such as you describe are carried out, a good man's
evidence being black, the intention could not be made
white. Now, according to my idea of the law of
nature, a man's merits are in his moral integrity and
behaviour; therefore I should establish the rule that
a good black man was better than a bad white man,
and was as much entitled to the respect and government
of law."</p>
            <p>"Hi!—oh! Captain; it won't do to talk so in
South Carolina. Just let a nigger imagine himself as
good as a white man, and all the seven codes in
Christendom wouldn't keep 'em under. Ah! you've
got to learn a thing or two about niggers yet,"
interrupted Master George, before the Colonel had
time to speak.</p>
            <p>"I only speak from my observation of human
nature; but I may become better acquainted with
your laws, if I remain among you," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"As I have said before sir," replied the Colonel,
"our nigger-laws are such as to require a strict enforcement.
If we allowed the prerogative of a discretionary
power, it would open the way to an endless<pb n="86"/>
system of favoritism, just at the mercy and feelings
of those exercising it. As it is now, the white or black
nigger, male or female, gets the same law and the
same penalty. We make no distinction even at the
paddle-gallows.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>The
paddle-gallows is a frame with two uprights, and a
wrench screw at the top. The negro's hands are secured in iron
wristlets—similar to handcuffs; a rope is then attached to an eye
in these, and passing over the wrench, which being turned, the negro
is raised in an agonizing position until the tips of his toes scarcely
touch the floor. Thus suspended, with the skin stretched to its
utmost tension, it not unfrequently parts at the first blow of the
paddle. Sometimes the feet are secured, when the effect of this
modern science of demonstrating the tension of the human body
for punishment becomes more painful under the paddle. South
Carolinians deny this mode of punishment generally, and never
allow strangers to witness it. It is not, as some writers have
stated, practised in Georgia, where, we are happy to say, that so
far as punishment is conducted in a legal manner, at the jails and
prisons, it is administered in a humane manner; and instead of
turning modern barbarity into a science, as is, done in South
Carolina, a strict regard for the criminal is observed.</p>
               </note>
I will relate some singular facts
connected with the strictness with which we South
Carolinians carry out our laws. And now that we
are on the spot connected with it, its associations are
more forcibly impressed on my mind. It brings with
it many painful remembrances, and, were we differently
situated, I should wish the cause to be removed. But
it cannot be, and we must carry out the law without
making allowances, for in these little leniencies all those
evils which threaten the destruction of our peculiar
institution creep in. In fact, Captain, they are
points of law upon which all our domestic quietude
stands; and as such, we are bound to strengthen our
means of enforcing them to the strictest letter. Our
laws are founded upon the ancient wisdom of our<pb n="87"/>
forefathers, and South Carolina has never traduced
herself or injured her legal purity. We have reduced
our system almost to a practical science, so
complete in its bearings and points of government
as to be worthy the highest and noblest purposes of
our country. And at the same time, such is the spirit
and magnanimity of our people, that in framing laws
to guard against the dangerous influences of that
wing of our country that spreads its ambitious fallacies—its
tempting attractions—shallow criticisms
upon minute and isolated cases—redundant theories
without measure or observation, and making a standard
for the government of slaves upon foolish and
capricious prejudices, we have been careful to preserve
a conservative moderation toward the slave. But, to
my remarks."</p>
            <p>The party had now arrived opposite to what was
formerly known as Jones's Hotel, where the Colonel
made a halt to relate the singular case that had
pained his feelings, though he held very tenaciously
to the law as it was, because he believed strongly in
the wisdom of the South Carolina judiciary.</p>
            <p>"Our first and great object is to prevent the
interchange of sentiment between our domestic
niggers, whether bond or free, and niggers who reside
abroad or have left our State; To do this, it became
imperative to establish a law prohibiting free negroes
from coming into the State, and those in the State
from going out, under penalty of imprisonment and
fine, if they returned. The penalty amounted to sale
upon a peon form; and subjected the offender to the
slave system in a manner that he seldom retrieved
himself. You will observe, Captain, the penalty
is not desired by our people, the object being to <orig>pre-</orig>
               <pb n="88"/>
vent them from returning, and as such it must be
taken in the spirit of its origin. Another very wise
provision was made by our legislators, and which has
prevented a great deal of suffering on the part of
the slave. A few years ago, our wise legislature
made a law to revert the power of emancipation from
the board of magistrates where it had been very
much abused, to the House itself. And such is the
law at the present day, that no master can give his
slaves their freedom, except by special act of the
legislature, and that with such a multiplicity of provisions
and conditions that few even attempt it. But
I'm about to refer to cases in which some modification
might be said to have been necessary, because <emph>in
them</emph> are embodied the worst germs for abolition
speculation. </p>
            <p>"That, Captain, is Jones's Hotel," said the Colonel,
pointing to an odd-looking house of antique and
mixed architecture, with a large convex window
above the hall-entrance, in the second story. This
house is situated in Broad street, next to the aristocratic
St. Michael's Church, one of the most public
places in the city. "In years past, that house was
kept by Jones, a free nigger. Jones was almost
white, a fine portly-looking man, active, enterprising,
intelligent, honest to the letter, and whose integrity
and responsibility was never doubted. He lived in
every way like a white man, and, I think, with few
exceptions, never kept company with even <emph>bright
folks</emph>. His house was unquestionably the best in the
city, and had a widespread reputation. Few persons
of note ever visited Charleston without putting
up at Jones's, where they found, not only the comforts
of a private house, but a table spread with every<pb n="89"/>
luxury that the county afforded. The Governor always
put up at Jones's; and when you were travelling
abroad, strangers would speak of the sumptuous fare at
Jones's in Charleston, and the elegance and correctness
of his house. But if his house and fare were the boast
of Carolinians, and the remark of strangers, his civility
and courteous attention could not be outdone. Jones
continued in the popularity of his house for many
years, reared a beautiful, intelligent, and interesting
family; at the same time accumulated about forty
thousand dollars. The most interesting part of his
family was three beautiful daughters, the eldest of
whom was married to a person now in New York. She
was fairer than seven-eighths of those ladies who
term themselves aristocracy in Charleston, and
promenade King street in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>"She removed to New York with her husband, who
now resides in that city, engaged in lucrative and
respectable business. A short time after, her second
sister—not dreaming that the law would be so
stringent as to class her with the lowest nigger, or
even lay its painful bearings at her door; for the
family were very high-minded, and would have considered
themselves grossly insulted to have the opprobrious
name of nigger applied to them—paid her a
visit. The public became acquainted with the fact,
and to his surprise, Jones was informed by authority
that upon no condition could she be allowed to return—that
the law was imperative, and no consideration
could be given to the circumstances, for such would
be virtually destroying its validity, and furnishing a
precedent that would be followed by innumerable
cases. In spite of all the remonstrances which Jones
could set forth, and the influence of several friends<pb n="90"/>
of high standing, he was compelled to relinquish all
hope of his daughter's being allowed to return to the
family. The reasoning set forth had every plausibility;
but such is our respect for the law, that we
were compelled to forego our hospitality, and maintain
it, even though the case was painful to our
feelings. Thus, you see, we maintain the point and
spirit of the law above every thing else.</p>
            <p>"But the end is not here! A few years after this,
Jones received a letter, that his daughter was very
sick and not expected to live—accompanied with a
desire to have the last soothing comfort of seeing her
parents. Jones being an affectionate man, and
dotingly fond of his children, without regarding
the former admonition, immediately prepared himself,
and left in disguise for New York. Mature consideration
would have convinced him of the error of one
so well known as himself trying to elude recognition.</p>
            <p>"His son-in-law, Lee, a noble fellow, kept the house,
and when Jones was inquired for, it was reported
that he was confined to his room. It would have
been well if Jones had kept himself secluded in New
York; but he was recognised by a Charlestonian,
and, as such reports have uncommon wings, the news
of it soon reached the authorities; when a mandate
was issued accordingly, and Jones subjected to the
fate of his daughter. There are many painful circumstances
connected with the affair, which, if well
told, would make quite a romance," said the Colonel,
all of which the Captain listened to with profound
attention. "His family all moved to New York, and
his affairs were put into the hands of attorneys here,
for settlement, by his son-in-law, who continued the
business for some years."</p>
            <pb n="91"/>
            <p>"Of course he got his property restored to him?"
interrupted the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Most certainly, Captain! The spirit of justice is
coequal with that of honorable law, in South Carolina,"
said George, anxious to relieve the Colonel of
the answer.</p>
            <p>"It is somewhat difficult to settle a man's business
by legal process when the principal is not present.
The law's delay and lawyers' spoils make time
hallowed and costly," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"You're right there, Captain," said the Colonel;
"and I doubt—to speak honestly—whether Jones ever
got much of his property. There's a good many
stories told, and a great deal of mystery about it that's
got to be explained to my mind. But you're a
stranger, Captain, and it would not be interesting to
the feelings of a Scotchman. I may give you the
details more minutely at some future day."</p>
            <p>"Why, Colonel!" said George, "you should be
considerate in your statements. Remember the
immense difficulty that has attended Jones's affairs—they're
not all settled yet."</p>
            <p>"True, George; and I'm afraid they never will be;—but
there are some very singular appearances connected
with it. I mean no personal disrespect toward
those cousins of yours who have figured in the case.
'Tis bad to call names, but there is a mystery about
a certain member of our profession getting rich, when
poor Jones declares he's got nothing, and Lee has had
to give up the house,—I don't say what for." *   *   *</p>
            <p>"Yes, strange things must be kept strangely secret
in some parts of the world, and only whispered when
there's no wind," said the Captain.</p>
            <p>"But that's the only case, Captain," said George;<pb n="92"/>
"and the Colonel was indiscreet in recounting it;
for from that you may conceive wrong impressions
of the best institutions and laws in the world. Jones
was an old fool, led away by his nigger-like affections
for them gals of his. He never knew when he was
well off, and always wanted to be with white folk
when he was here. 'Twould been a great deal better
if he'd let them youngest gals gone with Pingree and
Allston. They'd have made the tip-top mistresses—been
kept like ladies, and not been bothered, and
brought all this trouble upon their heads through
these infernal abolitionists. I really believe the old
fool thought some white man would marry them at
one time."</p>
            <p>"What harm would there've been in that, providing
they're as white as anybody, and got plenty of
money, and were handsome? There must be a singular
sensibility, that I don't understand, exerting
itself in your society," said the Captain laconically.</p>
            <p>"Harm! You'd find out the harm. Just live in
South Carolina a year or two. 'Tisn't the fair
complexion—we don't dispute that—but it's the blood."</p>
            <p>"Oh! then the legal objection," said the Captain,
"is what is so revolting to society, eh! It may be
sown broadcast in licentiousness, then, and custom
sustains an immoral element that is devouring the
essential bond of society."</p>
            <p>"Excuse me, Captain," interrupted the Colonel.
"George, you are always taking me upon suppositions.
I only related it to the Captain in order to show the
power and integrity of our law, and how South Carolinians
frequently sacrifice their own interests to maintain
it intact. Nothing could be more fatal to its
vitality than to make provisions which would entail<pb n="93"/>
legal preferences. The law in regard to free niggers
leaving the State should be looked upon in the light
of protection rather than alienation, for it is made to
protect property and society. Yet where a case is
attended with such circumstances as that of Jones's,
some disposition to accommodate might have been
evinced without endangering the State's sovereignty.
And I must also differ with you, George, so far as
the girls maintained their self-respect. It was commendable
in them to get husbands whom they could
live with in the bonds of matrimony. My word for
it, George, though I am a Southerner, and may give
rein to improprieties at times, nothing can be more
pernicious to our society than this destructive system
of our first people in keeping mistresses. It's a source
of misery at best, depending upon expediency instead
of obligation, and results in bringing forth children
and heirs with an entailed burden upon their lives,
to be disowned, cast off from paternal rights, and
left to the tender mercies of the law. We see the
curse, yet countenance it—and while it devours domestic
affections and has cankered the core of social
obligations, we look upon it as a flowery garden as
we pass by the wayside.. There may be but a shadow
between the rightful heir and the doubtful son—the
former may enjoy the bounty of his inheritance,
but the latter is doomed to know not his sire nor his
kinsman, but to suffer the doubts and fears and the
dark gloom which broods over a bondman's life."</p>
            <p>"By-je-w-hu! Colonel, what in scissors are you
preaching about. You must a' got a pull too much
at Bakers's. You're giving vent to real abolition sentiments.
Exercise your knowledge of the provision
that is made for such children. The Captain will<pb n="94"/>
certainly draw incorrect notions about us," said
George, with anxiety pictured on his countenance.
He knew the Colonel's free, open, and frank manner
of expressing himself, and feared lest the famous
name of the chivalry should suffer from his unconscious
disclosures.</p>
            <p>"Provisions! George, you know my feelings concerning
that vice which is so universally practised in
our community. If you know of any provision, it's
more than I do. Perhaps you are older and have had
more experience. 'Tis the want of such a provision
that is just destroying our institution of slavery!"</p>
            <p>At this juncture the Captain interrupted them, and
begging that the Colonel would finish the story about
Jones, said he had a few questions to ask them after
it was through.</p>
            <p>"Well," said the Colonel, "Jones died, I believe;
but his family are as industrious as ever, and have
made money enough to live comfortable; but the
scamps have turned out perfect helpmates of the abolitionists,
and make their intelligence figure at the
bottom of many an escape. But Lee's case is as
hard as Jones's. His son went to New York to see
his grandfather, and was debarred by the same statute
of limitations. Lee, however, was a very capable fellow,
and after trying for two years, and finding it
would be impossible to return to his father, very
shrewdly set about some kind of business, and is now
largely engaged in the preserve and pickle
business.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>Lee's celebrated pickle and preserve establishment, New York.</p>
               </note>
The father is now in this city, making a living for his
family at <emph>something or other</emph>. He has made several
efforts to sell out his little property, but there's some<pb n="95"/>
trouble about the title; and if he leaves it to go and
see his son, he knows what the consequences will be;
and to leave it for settlement would be to abandon it,
to the same fate that swallowed up Jones's. Thus
the son cannot come to visit his father, nor the father
go to visit the son. This, in my opinion, is carrying
a prohibition to an extreme point; and although I
believe the law should be maintained, I cannot believe
that any good arises from it upon such people as the
Jones's and Lee's, from the very fact that they never
associated with niggers. Hence, where there is no
grounds for fear there can be no cause for action,"
continued the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"Just what I wanted to know," said the Captain.
"As I informed you, I am driven into your port in
distress. Charleston, as you are aware, is in an advantageous
latitude for vessels to refit that have met
with those disasters which, are frequent in the gulf
and among the Bahamas. Thus I expected to find
good facilities here, without any unkind feeling on the
part of the people"—</p>
            <p>"Oh! bless me, Captain, you will find us the most
hospitable people in the world," said the Colonel.</p>
            <p>"But your pilot told me I would have trouble with
my steward, and that the law would make no distinction
between his being cast upon your shores in distress
and subject to your sympathy, and his coming
in voluntarily."</p>
            <p>"What!" said little George. "Is he a nigger,
Captain? Old Grimshaw's just as sure to nab him
as you're a white man. He'll buy and sell a saint for
the fees, and gives such an extended construction to
the terms of the act that you need expect no special
favor at his hands. The law's no fiction with him.<pb n="96"/>
I'm sorry, Captain: you may judge his conduct as an
index of that of our people, and I know him so well
that I fear the consequences."</p>
            <p>"No!" said the Captain. "My steward is a Portuguese,
a sort of mestino, and one of the best men
that ever stepped foot aboard a vessel. He is willing,
intelligent, always ready to do his duty, and is
a great favorite with his shipmates, and saves his
wages like a good man—but he is olive complexion,
like a Spaniard. He has sailed under the British
flag for a great many years, has been 'most all over the
world, and is as much attached to the service as if he
was a Londoner, and has got a register ticket. Nothing
would pain my feelings more than to see him
in a prison, for I think he has as proud a notion of
honesty as any man I've seen, and I know he wouldn't
commit a crime that would subject him to imprisonment
for the world. The boys have been pestering
the poor fellow, and telling him about some old fellow
they heard the pilot speak about, called Norman
Gadsden; they tell him if he catches him they'll sell
him for a slave."</p>
            <p>"The question is one about which you need give
yourself no concern. Our people are not so inhuman
but that they will shelter a castaway sailor,
and extend those comforts which are due from all
humane people. The act under which seamen are
imprisoned is the law provided to prohibit free niggers
from entering our port, and, in my opinion, was
brought into life for the sake of the fees. It's no
more nor less than a tax and restriction upon commerce,
and I doubt whether it was ever the intention
of the framers that it should be construed in this
manner. However, so far as your steward is <orig>con-</orig>
               <pb n="97"/>
cerned, the question of how far his color will make
him amenable to the law will never be raised; the
mere circumstance of his being a seaman in distress,
thrown upon our sympathies, will be all you need
among our hospitable people. I'm not aware of a
precedent, but I will guaranty his safety from a
knowledge of the feelings of our people. Our merchants
are, with few exceptions, opposed to the law
in this sense, but such is the power and control of a
class of inexperienced legislators, prompted by a
most trifling clique of office-holders, that their voice
has no weight. I am opposed to this system of dragging
people into courts of law upon every pretext.
It is practised too much in our city for the good of
its name."</p>
            <p>Upon this the Colonel and little George accompanied
the Captain to his ship, and, expressing their
heartfelt regrets at her appearance, bid him good-night—George
promising to call upon him in the
morning, and the Colonel charging him to give himself
no trouble about his steward, that he would see
Mr. Grimshaw that night, and make all things
straight.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Captain's first night in Charleston,
and represented a picture from which he might have
drawn conclusions somewhat different from the actual
result. Alas! that all the good fellowship and pleasant
associations of a people should be disgraced
by an absurdity arising from their fears.</p>
            <p>The Colonel might have given many other instances
equally as painful as that connected with the transportation
of Jones and his family, and the fetters
that were placed upon poor Lee. He might have instanced
that of Malcome Brown, a wealthy, <orig>industri-</orig>
               <pb n="98"/>
ous, honest, high-minded, and straightforward man,
now living at Aiken, in South Carolina. Brown conducts
a profitable mechanical business, is unquestionably
the best horticulturist in the State, and produces
the best fruit brought to the Charleston market.
What has he done to be degraded in the eyes
of the law? Why is he looked upon as a dangerous
citizen and his influence feared? Why is he refused
a hearing through those laws which bad white men
take the advantage of? He is compelled to submit
to those which were made to govern the worst slaves!
And why is he subjected to that injustice which gives
him no voice in his own behalf when the most depraved
whites are his accusers? Can it be the little
crimp that is in his hair? for he has a fairer skin than
those who make laws to oppress him. If he inhaled
the free atmosphere from abroad, can it be that there
is contagion in it, and Malcome Brown is the dreaded
medium of its communication? And if the statement
rung in our ears be true, "<emph>that the free colored of the
North suffer while the slave is cared for and comfortable</emph>,"
why belie ourselves? Malcome's influence is,
and always has been, with the whites, and manifestly
good in the preservation of order and obedience on
the part of the slaves. He pursues his avocation
with spirit and enterprise, while he is subjected to
menial and oppressive laws. His father visited New
York, and was forbidden to return. He appealed
again and again, set forth his claims and his integrity
to the State and her laws, but all was of no avail.
He was hopelessly banished, as it were, from ever seeing
his son again, unless that son would sacrifice his
property and submit to perpetual banishment from
the State. If we reflect upon the many paternal <orig>as-</orig>
               <pb n="99"/>
sociations that would gladden the hearts of father
and child to meet in happy affection, we may realize
the effect of that law which makes the separation
painful and which denies even the death-bed scene
its last cheering consolation.</p>
            <p>We have conversed with poor Brown on many occasions,
found him a very intelligent man, full of
humour, and fond of relating incidents in the history
of his family—even proud of his good credit in Charleston.
He frequently speaks of his father and the gratifying
hope of meeting him at some future day, when
he can give vent to his feelings in bursts of affection.
He wants his father to return and live with him, because
he says he knows they would be more happy
together. "I suppose the law was made in justice,
and it's right for me to submit to it," he would say
when conversing upon its stringency; and it also
seems a sort of comfort to him that he is not the
only sufferer.</p>
            <p>If South Carolina would awake to her own interest,
she would find more to fear from the stringency of
her own laws than from the influence of a few men
coming from abroad.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE PROSPECT DARKENING.</head>
            <p>AFTER the Colonel and little George left the Captain,
as we have stated in the foregoing chapter, he
descended into the cabin, and found Manuel sitting
upon one of the lockers, apparently in great anxiety.
He, however, waited for the mate to speak before he
addressed the Captain. The mate awoke and informed
the Captain that a slender, dark-complexioned
man had been aboard a few minutes after he left, making
particular inquiries about the steward; that he
spoke like an official man, was dressed in black clothes,
and wore spectacles.</p>
            <p>"I asked him if we'd have any trouble with Manuel,
and tried to make him understand that he wasn't a
black, and that our situation might excuse us from
any annoyance through their peculiar laws. But the
old chap seemed mighty stupid about every thing, and
talked just as if he didn't know any thing about nothing.
'A nigger's a nigger in South Carolina,'
said he dryly, and inquired for a quid of tobacco,
which I handed him, and he took one big enough for
six. Said I, 'Mister, do you call a man a nigger
what's a Portugee and a'n't black?' 'It depends on
how he was born,' says he. 'Well, but ye can't make
a white man a nigger nohow, whether it's in South
Carolina or Scotland,' says I. 'Well, we don't stand
upon such things here; we can show you niggers as
white as you be, Mr. Mate,' says he. 'But, Mister,<pb n="101"/>
what's to do about our steward, that ye make yer
inquiries about him; he ha'n't did nothing,' said I.
'Well, Mr. Mate; it's <emph>contrary to law</emph> to bring nigger
stewards into our port. They're a bad set of
fellows generally, and we claim the right to lock 'em
up to insure their good behavior and keep their bad
influence away from our slaves. 'Tis not my office.
I observed your arrival and wrecked condition, and
merely came to take a look,' said he. 'Well now,
Mister, our steward thinks as much of himself as anybody
and wouldn't mix with your niggers on any account.
But Mister! won't it make a difference because
we're cast upon your shore in distress,' says I.
'Not a whit! it's <emph>contrary to law</emph>, and the law's got
nothing to do with wind and weather. We love
the sovereignty of our law too well to make any discrimination.
We're a hospitable people, and always
give folks plenty to eat, but we never allow any favors
in the law. I'll call and see you in the, morning,'
said he, and away he went."</p>
            <p>This individual was Mr. Grimshaw, the principal
mover of the powers <emph>that be</emph>, notwithstanding he
asserted that it was not his office, and that he just
walked round to take a look.</p>
            <p>During his visit on board, Manuel was absent on
board a Boston bark, where he met a white steward,
who gave him a sad picture of the Charleston jail
and the cruel treatment that was inflicted upon prisoners
there by starvation. He told him that he was
once put in for a trifling offence, and nearly starved to
death before he got out. "You will be sure to go
there, Manuel," said he, "for they make no distinction;
and if a man's a foreigner, and can't speak for
himself, he'll stand no chance at all. I'd give 'em the<pb n="102"/>
slip afore I'd suffer such another punishment," he
continued.</p>
            <p>This so worked upon the poor fellow's mind, that
it became a matter of little moment whether he
jumped overboard or remained on the ship. He
waited until the mate had concluded, and commenced
appealing to the Captain in a most pitiful
manner. The disgrace of being imprisoned seemed
worse than the punishment; and he did not seem to
comprehend the intention that he should be imprisoned
for no crime in the United States, when he had
sailed around the world and visited a majority of its
ports, both barbarous and civilized, without molestation.
He wanted the Captain to pay him off and let
him leave by some vessel in the morning. The Captain
endeavored to soothe his fears by assuring him
that there was no danger of his being imprisoned;
that the people of Charleston had too much good feeling
in them to be cruel to a distressed sailor; that
the power of the consul was a sufficient guarantee
of protection. "You are not among Patagonians,
Manuel," said he. "There's no use of working your
mind into a fever, you'll be as well taken care of here
and be thought as much of as you would in London."
This assurance had the effect to soothe his mind, upon
which he left the cabin more at ease, and went into
the forecastle to turn in with his little companion
Tommy. Men had been detailed for the pumps as
soon as the flood-tide made, and the Captain retired
to his berth.</p>
            <p>It seemed there was a mutual understanding between
the pilots and officers in regard to the arrival
of colored stewards; and the pilot, after leaving the
vessel, went directly to Mr. Grimshaw's office and<pb n="103"/>
reported a nut for him to crack: this brought him to
the wharf to "look around."</p>
            <p>Early in the morning the crew were at their duty.
The mate commenced giving orders to clear away
the deck, and Manuel to make preparations for
breakfast. He had scarcely commenced before two
men, Messrs. Dunn and Dusenberry walked up and
down the wharf for several minutes, then they would
stand together and gaze as if to watch the approach
of some vessel in the offing. At length, Dusenberry,
seeing Manuel come to the gangway with a bucket in
his hand, walked to her side, and, stepping on board,
seized him by the collar, and drawing a paper from
his pocket, said, "You're my prisoner! you must go
to jail—come, be quick, sir; you must not stop to
get your things; you must send for them after you're
committed."</p>
            <p>The mate and several of the crew being near, at
once gathered around him. At the same time Dunn,
who was standing at the end of the wharf awaiting
the result, thinking Dusenberry was opposed, came
to his assistance. The officers and crew knew the
respect due to the laws too well to oppose any obstacles
to the constables in executing their duty. The
mate, in a very polite manner, asked as a favor that
they would leave the man a few minutes until the
Captain came on deck. They yielded to his solicitation
after a great deal of grumbling. The arrest
made a deep feeling among the seamen, but none felt
it more than little Tommy; he heard the noise upon
deck, and came running with tears in his eyes, and
cried, "Oh! Manuel, why Manuel, what are they
going to take you away for? Won't I see you again,
Manuel?" The little fellow's simplicity touched the<pb n="104"/>
feelings of all present. But the lame officer, Dunn,
stood with a pair of handcuffs in his hand, as unmoved
as a stoic, while Dusenberry expressed his
impatience, and began to push the boy away, and
motion to march him off.</p>
            <p>"Hold a bit!" said the mate. "The Captain will
be on deck in a few minutes; he wants a word or two
with you."</p>
            <p>"We can't stop unless we're compensated for our
time. 'Tis no use to delay—'twon't do any good;
he's a nigger to all intents and purposes. I know by
the curl in his hair—they can't escape me, I've had
too much to do with them!" said Dunn. "Yes, to
be sure, I can tell a nigger by his ear, if his skin's
as white as chalk!" said Dusenberry. "It's all
gammon this bringing bright outlandish men here, and
trying to pass them off for white folks. 'Twon't stick—you
must come up and be registered, and you'll
have a good time at the jail, my boy; there's plenty
of bright gals in there, and you can have a wife, if
you know how to do the courting."</p>
            <p>The Captain now came upon deck; and began to
intercede, begging that they would not take Manuel
away until he had seen the British Consul. "I know
I can make every thing straight. There is no occasion
to imprison my steward—he's neither a nigger
nor a bad man; and I'll pledge you my honor that he
shall not leave the ship, or even go upon the wharf, if
you will only allow me to see the Consul before you
take any further action," he continued.</p>
            <p>"That is beyond our power, sir; you must see the
sheriff—you'll find him in his office bright and early.
But you might as well put your appeal in your pocket,
or send it to Queen Victoria, for all Consul Mathew can<pb n="105"/>
do for you. He's been kicking up a fuss for two
years; but he might as well whistle agin a brickbat
as to talk his nonsense about English niggers to
South Carolina. He'll get tarred and feathered yet,
if he a'n't mighty shy about his movements. Sorry,
Captain, we can't accommodate you, but we're only
actin' for the sheriff, and his orders are imperative to
bring him right up. We must lock the fellow up.
We don't make the law, nor we ha'n't the power to
control it." Thus saying, Dunn took a little key
from his pocket and begun to turn it in the handcuffs.</p>
            <p>"What!" said the Captain—"don't attempt to
put them things on my man, upon your peril. Is
that the way you treat a poor shipwrecked sailor in
South Carolina, the State of boasted hospitality?
No, sir! I will sacrifice my life before my man shall
submit to such a thing," said the Captain, with his
Scotch energy aroused.</p>
            <p>"Captain!" said Dunn, "we'd not be takin' the
advantage of ye because ye're a stranger, but 'tis the
law; and if we accommodates ye, sure it'll be at our
own risk. But anyhow, Captain, ye'd be keepin'
meself an' this gentleman a long time waiting,
'twouldn't be. amiss to be giving us the usual
perquisite. You won't miss it, and we've a great
deal to do for small fees, that niver compinsate for
the accommodation we be's to give everybody—an'
the loss of time's the loss of money."</p>
            <p>"Give you a perquisite!—no, indeed; I never pay
for such favors. Wait a few moments; I will accompany
you myself, if you will not take my honor for
his good conduct on the way to prison," continued
the Captain.</p>
            <pb n="106"/>
            <p>"Captain, sure ye needn't trouble yerself anyhow;
we'll take yer honor that he don't run away, and if
he does ye'll stand the odds at the sheriff's. Sure a
case would niver pass Mr. Grimshaw s observation;
but to plase ye, and considering' the wreck, meself
and Dusenberry 'll put him up without," said Dunn.</p>
            <p>During the conversation, Manuel plead hard to be
heard before the Consul, having a mistaken idea that
the Consul could protect him from all danger; and
that if he could get a hearing before him, he was
sure to be released. The Captain shook his hand
and told him to be contented until the Consul's office
opened, when he would come to the jail and see him.
Manuel then turned to the crew, and shaking the
hands of each, took his little bundle in one hand,
and holding little Tommy by the other, (who accompanied
him to the head of the wharf,) was soon out
of sight.</p>
            <p>But will the reader believe what was the practice
of these petty officers? We can assure them that such
instances as the one we shall relate are not only
practised in Charleston to an unlimited extent, but
the fact is well known to both magistrates and the
public; the former treat it as moonshine, and the
latter rail against it, but never take proper action.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had little Tommy left them at the head
of the wharf, before they intimated that it would be
well to consider a morning dram. To this end, they
walked into a "Dutch corner shop," and passing into
the back room, gave sundry insinuations that could
not be misunderstood. "Well! come, who pays
the shot?" said Dunn, stepping up to the counter,
and crooking his finger upon his nose at a dumpling-faced
Dutchman, who stood behind the counter,<pb n="107"/>
waiting for his man to name it. The Dutchman was
very short and very thick, leaving the impression
that he had been very much depressed in his own
country when young. He rubbed his hands and
flirted his fingers in motion of anxiety, "Every
ting vat de shentleman vant him—dare notin like
to my zin and brondty vat him got mit ze zity," said
Dutchy.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, I should be glad to have you drink
with me, if it be proper to ask," said Manuel</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes—certainly, yes!—just what we come for,
something to cut away the cobwebs—'twouldn't do to
go out in the morning fog without a lining," said
Dunn.</p>
            <p>"Name it! name it! shentlemen," exclaimed the
Dutchman, as he rapped his fingers upon the counter,
and seemed impatient to draw forth his filthy stuff.
They named their drinks, each with a different name.
Manuel not being a Charleston graduate in the profession
of mixing drinks and attaching slang names
to them, Mr. Dusenberry undertook to instruct him
in a choice. The Dutchman was an adept at mixing,
and the "<emph>morning pulls</emph>" were soon set out to the
extreme satisfaction of Dunn and Dusenberry. "All
right! tip her down, my old fellow; none o' yer
screwed faces over such liquor as that. We drink on
the legitimate, in Charleston, and can put it down
until we see stars," said Dusenberry, addressing himself
to Manuel, who was making a wry face, while
straining to swallow the cut-throat stuff.</p>
            <p>Dusenberry now left Manuel in charge of Dunn,
saying he was going out to attend to some business.
Manuel drew from his pocket a quarter of a Colombian
doubloon, and throwing it upon the counter, told<pb n="108"/>
the Dutchman to give him change. The Dutchman
picked it up, turned it over several times, and
squinting at it, inquired, in a very unpretending
manner, what its value was. He knew already, yet
this was only done to try Manuel. At the same
moment he winked to Dunn, who, stepping up, gave
it a significant toss upon the counter. "The divil a
bit more than two dollars; all right, Swizer," said he.</p>
            <p>"'Tis four dollar, West Inge—I want my change,"
said Manuel, shrugging his shoulders. "I no want
no more than my own; and no man to cheat-e me."</p>
            <p>"Don't be bothering with your four dollars—sure
ye a'n't in the West Inges now; and money's plenty
in Charleston, and I can't bring up so much—half so
much. Don't be bothering with yer West Inge nonsense.
If ye try to raise a fuss here, I'll make the
Captain suffer. Ye must learn that it won't do for a
nigger to dispute a white man in Charleston; we'd
twitch ye up by the same law; we'd put it to our own
niggers, and ye'd git trised up, and about fifty
paddles on yer bare butt." The Dutchman put down
a dollar and seventy cents, but Manuel refused to
take it up; when this fellow, Dunn, pretending to be
the friend of Manuel, held out his hand, and telling
the bar-keeper to put another dollar, which he did,
he passed it hurriedly into Manuel's hand, and
making a pass, told him to put it into his pocket.</p>
            <p>It was now about good business time for the Dutchman,
and his customers were coming in with their
bottles and pots in great numbers. The place was
a little filthy hole, very black and dirty, about twelve
feet long, and seven feet wide, with a high board
counter almost in the centre. The only stock-in-trade
that decorated it, was a few barrels of lager<pb n="109"/>
beer; several kegs, with names to set forth the different
qualities of liquors painted upon them; a bushel
basket about half full of onions, and a few salt fish in
a keg that stood by the door. Around the room
were several benches similar to those in guard-houses.
Upon two of them were stretched two ragged and
filthy-looking negroes, who looked as if they had
been spending the night in debauchery. Dunn, as if
to show his authority, limped toward them, and commenced
fledging their backs with his hickory stick in
a most unmerciful manner, until one poor old fellow,
with a lame hand, cried out for mercy at the top of
his voice.</p>
            <p>"It's a bad business keeping these niggers here all
night, Swizer—you know I've done the clean thing
with you several times," said Dunn, pointing his
finger at the Dutchman; who winked, and coming
from behind the counter, slipped something into his
hand, and stepping to the door, assumed some threatning
language against the negroes, should they <emph>ever</emph>
came back to his store. A large portion of those who
came for liquor were negroes, who looked as if they
were parting with their last cent for stimulant, for
they were ragged and dirty, and needed bread more
than liquor. Their condition seemed pitiful in the
extreme, and yet the Dutch "corner-shop keeper"
actually got rich from their custom, and so craving
was he upon their patronage, that he treated them
with much more courtesy than his white
customers.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>These
"Dutch corner-shops" are notorious places in Charleston,
and are discountenanced by respectable citizens, because they
become the rendezvous of "niggers," who get into bad habits and
neglect their masters' or mistresses' business. Yet the keepers
exert such an influence at elections, that the officials not only fear
them, but in order to secure their favors, leave their rascality
unmolested. Well might a writer in the Charleston Courier of
August 31, 1852, say—</p>
                  <p>"We
were astonished, with many others, at the sweeping
charges made in the resolutions passed at the HUTCHINSON meeting
at Hatch's Hall, and were ready to enlist at once to lend our
voice to turn out an 'administration' that for two years permitted
'moral sentiment to be abandoned,' 'truthfulness disregarded,'
'reverence for religion obliterated,' 'protection to religious freedom
refused,' 'licentiousness allowed,' 'and a due administration
for vice, neglected.'" These charges stand unrefuted, and with
but one or two exceptions, we have never known one of those
unlawful corner shops prosecuted by the present administration.
And those single instances only where they were driven to notice
the most flagrant abuses.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <pb n="110"/>
            <p>It is strictly "<emph>contrary to law in Charleston</emph>," to
sell liquor to a negro without an order from a white
man; the penalty being fine and imprisonment. Yet,
so flagrant has become the abuse, that it is notorious
that hush-money is paid by a certain class of Dutch
liquor-sellers to the officers. In nearly all the streets
of Charleston, where there is a shanty or nook large
enough to hold a counter and some tumblers, these
wretches may be found dealing out their poisonous
drugs to a poor, half-starved class of negroes, who
resort to all kinds of dishonest means to get money to
spend at their counters. These places are nearly all
kept by foreigners, whose merciless avarice scruples
at nothing, however mean. They soon become
possessed of considerable means, and through their
courtesy and subserviency to the negro—for they
are the only class of whites that will beg his pardon,
if they have offended him—carry on a sort of active
rivalry with each other for his custom. It is from<pb n="111"/>
these miserable hells that seven-tenths of the crimes
arise for which the poor negro is dragged to the
work-house and made to suffer under the paddle.</p>
            <p>And yet these very men, whose connivance at vice
and crime is disregarded by the law, rise and take
position in society—not only entering into more respectable
business—but joining in that phalanx who are
seeking the life-blood of the old Southerner, and like
a silent moth, working upon his decay. There is a
deep significance in the answer so frequently given
in Charleston to the interrogatory, "Who lives in
that splendid dwelling—it seems to have been the
mansion of a prince, but is somewhat decayed?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! bless me, yes! It was once the mansion of
the So-and-sos, one of the first families, but they're
very poor now. Mr. What-you-may-call-em owns it
now—they say he didn't get it honestly. He kept a
little grog-shop on the Bay, or sold bacon and whisky
on the Bay, and made awful charges against poor So-and-so,
and after a long trial in Chancery he got his
house. He's a big fellow; now, I tell you, and is
going to fit the house up for himself!"</p>
            <p>Dunn told Manuel to be seated, that there was no
occasion for hurrying; it would be all right if he got
to the sheriffs office at nine o'clock; and then commenced
descanting upon the fine time he would have
at the jail. "There's a right good lot of comrades
there, me boy; ye'll have fiddling and dancing,
plenty of gals, and a jolly time; and ye a'n't a
criminal, ye know, so it won't be any thing at all,
only keep up a stiff under-lip. Come, let us take
another drink; I feel mighty husky this morning!"
said he. </p>
            <p>Just at this time Dusenberry re-entered, puffing and<pb n="112"/>
blowing as if he had been engaged in a foot-race.
"Another bird for old Grimshaw, at Commercial
Wharf! I know'd she had one aboard, 'cause I seed
him from the wharf," said he, in perfect ecstasy,
pulling out a pencil and making a note in a little
book.</p>
            <p>"Don't be a child," said Dunn. "Come, we have
just proposed another drink; you join of course; ye
niver says no,—eh, Duse?" They stepped to the
counter, and Dunn, again, pointing his finger upon
his nose at the Dutchman, who stood with his hands
spread upon the counter, called for gin and bitters,
Stoughton light. Turning to Manuel, who was sitting
upon a bench with his head reclined upon his
hand, apparently in deep meditation, he took him by
the collar in a rude manner, and dragging him to the
counter, said, "Come, by the pipers, rouse up your
spirits, and don't be sulking, my old Portugee; take
another O-be-joyful, and it'll put ye all right, and
ye'll dance a hornpipe like a jim-crack."</p>
            <p>"Excuse me, sir; I think I have taken enough; do,
please, either take me back to my vessel, or where
you are going to. This is no place for me!" said
Manuel.</p>
            <p>"Sure, what signifies; don't be talking your botheration
here; a nigger musn't sauce a white man.
Come, there's no use backing out; you must take a
glass of Swizer's lager beer," said Dunn.</p>
            <p>Manuel looked around him, and then closing up
very reluctantly, the Dutchman filled his glass with
frothy beer, and the three touched glasses and drank.
They then retired to a bench and commenced discussing
the propriety of some point of their official privileges,
while Manuel was left standing at the counter.</p>
            <pb n="113"/>
            <p>"Who pay de drink vat shu get?" inquired the
Dutchman, anxious to serve two little niggers who
had just come in with bottles in their hands.</p>
            <p>"It was our friend's treat; come, my good fellow,
do the clean thing according to Southern science.
We'll put a good word in for you to the jailer; you
won't lose nothing by it," said Dusenberry.</p>
            <p>"My friends, I work hard for my money, and have
none to spend foolishly. The small amount is of little
consequence, but I would much sooner make you a
present of it, than to be drugged by pretence. I've
no desire to indulge the propensities of others.
Whatever you are going to do with me, do it; and
let me know my fate. I am sick and fatigued, and
have need for the doctor. Take me to a prison or
where you please. I have done no crime; I want
sleep, not punishment. Next time I shipwrecked, I
get plank and go overboard 'fore I cum to Charleston."
So saying, he pulled out fifty cents and threw
it upon the counter, and the Dutchman swept it into
the drawer, as if it was all right, and "just the
change."</p>
            <p>"Shut up, you black rascal, you; you musn't talk
that way in South Carolina; we'll have you stretched
on the frame and paddled for insolence to a white
man. D——n me, if you're in such a hurry for it, just
come along," said Dusenberry; and reaching his hand
over to Dunn, took the handcuffs from him and
attempted to put them on Manuel's wrists. The
poor fellow struggled and begged for more than ten
minutes, and was wellnigh overpowering them, when
Dusenberry drew a long dirk-knife from his bosom,
and holding it in a threatening attitude at his breast,
uttered one of those fierce yells such as are common<pb n="114"/>
to slave-hunters, whose business it is to hunt and
run down runaway niggers with bloodhounds. "Submit,
you black villain, or I'll have your heart's blood;
bring a rope, and we'll trise him up here. Jump, be
quick, Swizer!" said he, addressing himself to the
Dutchman. The Dutchman ran into the front apartment;
brought out a cord similar to a clothes-line; and
commenced to undo it.</p>
            <p>"Do you give up now?" said Dusenberry, still holding
the knife pointed at him. Manuel was in the
habit of carrying a poniard when on shore in foreign
countries, and put his hand to his breast-pocket to
feel for it. He remembered that he had left it in his
chest, and that resistance would be useless against a
posse giving expression to such hostility to him. The
shackles were put upon his hands with ruffianly force.</p>
            <p>"Oh! am I a man, or am I a brute? What have
I done to receive such treatment? May God look
down upon me and forgive me my transgressions; for
in his hands are my rights, and he will give me justice,"
said Manuel, looking his cruel torturers in the
face.</p>
            <p>"A man! No, by heavens, you're a nigger; an'
it's that we'd he teaching you! Come, none of yer
sermons here, trot off! We'll give you a handkerchief
to cover your hands, if you're so d——d delicate
about walking through the streets," said Dunn,
throwing him an old red handkerchief, and marching
him along through Broad street. Dusenberry now
left him entirely in the charge of Dunn; while, as he
said, he went to Adger's Wharf to keep his eye on
another vessel that was approaching the dock. The
tricks of this man Dunn were well known to those,
connected with the police and sheriff's office; but,<pb n="115"/>
instead of being displaced for his many offences, he
was looked upon by <emph>them</emph> as the best officer upon the
rolls; and in fishing for mischievous niggers he was
held as a perfect paragon. In this instance he was
not contented with the outrages he had inflicted upon
Manuel at the Dutch grog-shop, which he had forced
him into, but he would stop in the public street to
hold conversation with every <hi>cove</hi> he met, and keep
the poor man standing for public gaze, like chained
innocence awaiting the nod of a villain. The picture
would have been complete, if a monster in human
form were placed in the foreground applying the
lash, according to the statute laws of South Carolina.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.</head>
            <p>IT is nine o'clock, on the morning of the 24th
March, 1852. Manuel was marched into the sheriff's
office, situated in the court-house, on the corner
of Broad and Meeting streets. A large table stood
in the centre of the room, covered with sundry old
papers and an inkstand. At one side was an old
sofa, bearing strong evidence of its being worn out at
the expense of the State. A few pine-wood and
painted book-stands, several tip-staffs, old broken-backed
chairs, and last, but not least, a wood-sawyer's
buck-saw, stood here and there in beautiful
disorder around the room; while, as if to display the
immense importance of the office, a "<hi>cocked</hi>" hat with
the judicial sword hung conspicuously above the old
sofa. A door opened upon the left hand, leading
into the clerk's office, where the books and archives
of the office were kept. Mr. Kanapeaux, the incumbent,
exhibited a great deal of good feeling, which it
would have lost the sheriff none of his reputation
to pattern after, and kept his office in very respectable
order.</p>
            <p>"Come in 'ere, Manwell, or whatever yer name is,"
said Dunn, as he led the way into the presence of
Mr. Grimshaw, the lean, haggard-looking man we
have before described. His dark, craven features,
as he sat peering through his glasses at the morning
news, gave him the appearance of a man of whom<pb n="117"/>
little was, to be expected by those who had the misfortune
to fall into his hands.</p>
            <p>"Ah! Dunn, you are the best officer in the city;
'pon my soul, these fellows can't escape you! Where
did you pick up that nigger?" said he, with a look of
satisfaction.</p>
            <p>"A fat fee case, Mr. Grimshaw, '<emph>contrary to law</emph>;'
he's a Portugee nigger. Never had so much trouble
with a nigger in my life; I didn't know but the fellow
was going to preach a sermon. The Captain—he
belongs to a wrecked Englishman—wanted to come
the gammon game with him, and pass him for a white
man; but sure he couldn't come that game over meself
and Duse, anyhow," said Dunn.</p>
            <p>Without saying a word, Manuel stood up before
his accusers, upon this strange charge of "<emph>contrary
to law</emph>."</p>
            <p>As he looked upon his accusers, he said, "What
have I done to suffer a murderer's fate? Am I to
be sold as a slave, because of the visitation of God?
I have done no murder! No!—nor have I stolen
in your land! and why did these men decoy me
into"—</p>
            <p>"Silence! silence! You are in the sheriff's office,"
said Dunn, pointing his finger at his nose. "You can't
come your John Bull nigger in South Carolina."</p>
            <p>This brought the sheriff's clerk to the door that
led into the passage. "Dunn, I have warned you
about these things several times; the public are
getting wind of them; they'll bring this office into
disrepute yet. You ought to know what effect
the association of officials with these 'corner-shop
keepers' is already having in the community,"
said he.</p>
            <pb n="118"/>
            <p>"How the divil do ye know what yer talking
about; sure it's his honor's bisniss, and not yours at
all, at all," said Dunn, addressing himself to Mr.
Kanapeaux, and then looking at Mr. Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Kanapeaux, you must not interfere with the
officers and their duty; attend to your business, and
get, your book ready to register this nigger-boy,"
said Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"Well, now, my good fellow," continued Grimshaw,
"I dislike this business very much; it don't pay me
enough for all the bother I have with it. 'Tis just a
little filtering of fees, which makes the duty of my
office exceedingly annoying. But we must respect
the law. We do these things to protect our institutions
and make them as light as possible. I might
give you a great deal of trouble; I have the power,
but I make it a point to consider men in your case,
and we'll make you so comfortable that you won't
think of being imprisoned. You must understand
that it is '<emph>contrary to law</emph>' to come among our
niggers in this way; it gives them fanciful ideas.
There's such an infernal imperfect state of things as
these abolitionists are getting every thing into, behooves
us to watch the communications which are
going on between, designing people and our slaves.
We are a <emph>hospitable people</emph>—the world knows that—and
have a religious respect for our laws, which we
enforce without respect to persons. We'd like to let
you go about the city, but then it's '<emph>contrary to law</emph>.'
Make up your mind, my good fellow, that you are
among humane people, who will seek to benefit you
among men of your class. Make yourself happy—and
look upon me as a friend, and you will never
be deceived. I control the jail, and my prisoners<pb n="119"/>
are as much attached to me as they would be to a
father."</p>
            <p>"It must be humanity that puts these symbols of
ignominy upon my hands," said Manuel; "that confines
me in a dungeon lest I should breathe a word of
liberty to ears that know it only as a fable."</p>
            <p>Nobody had asked him to sit down, and, feeling the
effect of his sickness and fatigue, he turned around as
if to look for something to rest against. "You must
not sit down,—take off your hat!" said Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>The poor fellow made an effort, but could not effect
it with the fetters on his hands; at which, Dunn
stepped up, and snatching it from his head, flung it
upon the floor. "You should learn manners, my
good fellow," said Grimshaw, "when you come into
a sheriff's office. It's a place of importance, and
people always pay respect to it when they come into
it; a few months in Charleston would make you as
polite as our niggers."</p>
            <p>"Had you not better take the irons off the poor
fellow's hands?—he looks as if he was tired out,"
said Mr. Kanapeaux, the clerk, who again came to
the door and looked upon Manuel with an air of pity.
The words of sympathy touched his feelings deeply;
it was a simple word in his favour, so different from
what he had met since he left the vessel, that he felt
a kind friend had spoken in his behalf, and he gave
way to his feeling in a gush of tears.</p>
            <p>"Good suggestion, Mr. Kanapeaux!" said Grimshaw.
"Better take 'em off, Mr. Dunn; I don't
think he'll give you any more difficulty. He seems
like a '<emph>likely fellow</emph>,' and knows, if he cuts up any
nigger rascality in Charleston, he'll be snapped up.
Now, my good fellow, put on your best-natured <orig>coun-</orig>
               <pb n="120"/>
tenance, and stand as straight as a ramrod. Mr.
Kanapeaux, get your book ready to register him,"
continued Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>Manuel now stood up under a slide, and his height
and general features were noted in the following
manner, in order to appease that sovereign dignity
of South Carolina law, which has so many strange
devices to show its importance:—</p>

            <p>After these remarks were duly entered, and Mr.
Grimshaw read another lecture to him on the importance
of South Carolina law, and the kindness he
would receive at his hands if he made himself <orig>con-</orig>
               <pb n="121"/>
tented, he was told that he could go and be committed.
The poor fellow had stood up until he was
nearly exhausted; yet, it was not enough to gratify
the feelings of that miserable miscreant, Dunn.
Scarcely had he left the sheriff's office, or passed
two squares from the court-house, before he entered
another Dutch grog-shop, a little more respectable in
appearance—but not in character. They entered by
a side door, which led into a back apartment provided
with a table and two wooden settees. As Dunn
entered, he was recognised by two negro-fellows, who
were playing dominoes at the table. They arose and
ran through the front store, into the street, as if
some evil spirit had descended among them. The
Dutchman sprang for the dominoes, and quickly
thrust them into a tin measure which he secreted
under the counter.</p>
            <p>"Ah! Drydez!" said Dunn; "you vagabond,
you; up to the old tricks again? Ye Dutchmen
are worse than the divil! It's meself'll make ye put
a <emph>five</emph> for that. Come, fork it over straight, and
don't be muttering yer Dutch lingo!"</p>
            <p>"Vat zue drink mit me dis morning? Misser
Dunz' te best fellow vat comez in my shop," said
Drydez.</p>
            <p>"Ah! stop yer botheration, and don't be comin'
yer Dutch logger over an Irishman! put down the
five dollars, and we'll take the drinks presently; meself
and me friend here'll drink yer health," said
Dunn, pointing to Manuel, who shook his head as
much as to decline. The Dutchman now opened his
drawer, and rolling a bill up in his fingers, passed it
as if unobserved into the hands of Dunn.</p>
            <p>"Now, Drydez," said Dunn, "if ye want to do the<pb n="122"/>
clean thing, put a couple of brandy smashes—none
of your d——d Dutch cut-throat brandy—the best old
stuff. Come, me old chuck, (turning to Manuel and
pulling him by the Whiskers,) cheer up, another good
stiff'ner will put you on your taps again. South
Carolina's a great State, and a man what can't be
happy in Charleston, ought to be put through by daylight
by the abolitionists."</p>
            <p>The Dutchman soon prepared the smashes, and
supplying them with straws, put them upon the table,
and seated chairs close at hand. "Excuse me!" said
Manuel, "I've drunk enough already, and should like
to lie down. I am unwell, and feel the effect of what
I have already taken. I am too feeble. Pray tell
me how far the prison is from here, and I will go
myself." </p>
            <p>"Go, is it?—the divil a go ye'll go from this until
ye drink the smash. None of yer Portugee independence
here. We larn niggers the politeness of gintlemen
in Charleston, me buck!" and seizing him by the
collar, dragged him to the table, then grasping the
tumbler with the other hand, he held it before his
face. "Do you see that? and, bedad, ye'll drink it,
and not be foolin', or I'd put the contents in your
phiz," said he.</p>
            <p>Manuel took the glass, while the Dutchman stood
chuckling over the very nice piece of fun, and the
spice of Mr. Dunn's wit, as he called it. "Vat zu
make him vat'e no vants too? You doz make me
laugh so ven zu comes 'ere, I likes to kilt myself," said
Drydez.</p>
            <p>A bright mulatto-fellow was now seen in the front
store, making quizzical signs to the Dutchman; who
understanding its signification, lost no time in slipping<pb n="123"/>
into his pocket a tumbler nearly half full of brandy
and water; and stepping behind the division door,
passed it slily to the mulatto, who equally as slily
passed it down his throat; and putting a piece of
money into the Dutchman's hand, stepped up to the
counter, as if to wait for his change. "All right!"
said the Dutchman, looking around at his shelves, and
then again under the counter.</p>
            <p>"No so!" said the mulatto; "I want fourpence;
you done' dat befor' several times; I wants my
money."</p>
            <p>"Get out of my store, or I'll kick you out," said
the Dutchman, and catching up a big club, ran from
behind the counter and commenced belaboring the
negro over the head in a most unmerciful manner.
At this, the mulatto retreated into the lane, and with
a volley of the vilest epithets, dared the Dutchman
to come out, and he would whip him.</p>
            <p>Dunn ran to the scene, and ordered the negro to
be off, and not use such language to a white man,
that it was "<emph>contrary to law</emph>," and he would take him
to the workhouse.</p>
            <p>"Why, massa, I knows what 'em respect white
men what be gemmen like yersef, but dat Dutchman
stand da'h a'n't no gentlem', he done gone tieffe my
money seven time; an' I whip him sure—jus' lef' him.
come out here. I doesn't care for true, and God saw
me, I be whip at the wukhouse next minute. He
tief, an' lie, an 'e cheat me." The Dutchman stood at
the door with the big stick in his hand—the negro in
the middle of the lane with his fists in a pugilistic
attitude, daring and threatening, while the limping
Dunn stood by the side of the Dutchman, acting as a
mediator. Manuel, taking advantage of the <orig>oppor-</orig>
               <pb n="124"/>
tunity, emptied his tumbler down a large opening in
the floor.</p>
            <p>It is a notorious fact in Charleston, that although
the negro, whether he be a black or white one, is held
in abject obedience to the <emph>white man proper</emph>, no
matter what his grade may be, yet such is the
covetous and condescending character of these groggery
keepers, that they become courteous to the negro
and submit to an equality of sociability. The negro,
taking advantage of this familiarity, will use the most
insulting and abusive language to this class of Dutchmen,
who, either through cowardice, or fear of losing
their trade, never resent it. We may say, in the
language of Dunn, when he was asked if negroes
had such liberties with white men in Charleston,
"A nigger knows a Dutch shopkeeper better than he
knows himself—a nigger dare not speak that way to
anybody else."</p>
            <p>The Dutchman gets a double profit from the negro,
and with it diffuses a double vice among them, for
which they have to suffer the severest penalty. It is
strictly "contrary to law" to purchase any thing from
a negro without a ticket to sell it, from his master.
But how is this regarded? Why, the shopkeeper
foregoes the ticket, encourages the warehouse negro
to steal, and purchases his stealings indiscriminately,
at about one-half their value. We might enumerate
fifty different modes practised by "<emph>good</emph>" legal voting
citizens—totally regardless of the law—and exerting
an influence upon the negro tenfold more direful
than that which could possibly arise from the conversation
of a few respectable men belonging to a
friendly nation.</p>
            <p>Dunn, after driving the mulatto man from the<pb n="125"/>
door and upbraiding the Dutchman for his cowardice,
returned to the table, and patting Manuel upon the
back, drank the balance of his smash, saying, "Come,
me good fellow, we must do the thing up brown, now;
we've got the Dutchman nailed on his own hook.
We must have another horn; it's just the stuff in our
climate; the 'Old Jug's' close by, and they'll be
makin' a parson of you when you get there. We've
had a right jolly time; and ye can't wet your whistle
when ye're fernint the gates."</p>
            <p>"I don't ask such favors, and will drink no more,"
said Manuel.</p>
            <p>"Fill her up, Drydez! fill her up! two more
smashes—best brandy and no mistake. You must
drink another, my old chuck—we'll bring the pious
notions out o' ye in Charleston," said Dunn, turning
around to Manuel.</p>
            <p>The Dutchman filled the glasses, and Dunn, laying
his big hickory stick upon the counter, took one in
each hand, and going directly to Manuel, "There,
take it, and drink her off—no humbugging; yer
mother niver gave such milk as that," said he.</p>
            <p>"Excuse me, sir; I positively will not!" said Manuel,
and no sooner had he lisped the words, than Dunn
threw the whole contents in his face. Enraged at
such outrageous conduct, the poor fellow could stand
it no longer, and fetched him a blow that levelled him
upon the floor.</p>
            <p>The Dutchman ran to the assistance of Dunn, and
succeeded in relieving him from his unenviable situation.
Not satisfied, however, they succeeded, after a
hard struggle, in getting him upon the floor, when the
Dutchman—after calling the assistance of a miserable
negro, held him down while Dunn beat him with his<pb n="126"/>
stick. His cries of "Murder" and "Help" resounded
throughout the neighbourhood, and notwithstanding
they attempted to gag him, brought several persons
to the spot. Among them was a well-known master
builder, in Charleston—a very muscular and a very
humane man. The rascality of Dunn was no new
thing to him, for he had had practical demonstrations
of it upon his own negroes,—who had been enticed
into the "<emph>corner shops</emph>" for the double purpose of
the Dutchmen getting their money, and the officers
getting hush-money from the owner.</p>
            <p>The moment he saw Dunn, he exclaimed, "Ah! you
vagabond!" and springing with the nimbleness of a
cat, struck the Dutchman a blow that sent him
measuring his length, into a corner among a lot of
empty boxes; then seizing Dunn by the collar, he
shook him like a puppy, and brought him a slap with
his open hand that double-dyed his red face, and
brought a stream of claret from his nose; while the
miserable nigger, who had been struggling to hold
Manuel down, let go his hold, and ran as if his life
was in danger. The scene was disgusting in the
extreme. Manuel arose, with his face cut in several
places, his clothes bedaubed with filth from the floor,
and his neck and shirt-bosom covered with blood;
while the aghast features of Dunn, with his red,
matted hair, and his glaring, vicious eyes, bespattered
with the combined blood of his victim and his own
nasal organ, gave him the most fiendish look imaginable.</p>
            <p>The gentleman, after reprimanding the Dutchman
for keeping up these miserable practices, which were
disgracing the community, and bringing suffering,
starvation, and death upon the slaves, turned to<pb n="127"/>
Dunn, and addressed him. "You are a pretty officer
of the law! A villain upon the highway—a disgrace
to your color, and a stain upon those who retain you
in office. A man who has violated the peace and
every principle of honest duty, a man who every day
merits the worst criminal punishment, kept in the
favor of the municipal department, to pollute its very
name. If there is a spark of honesty left in the
police department, I will use my influence to stop
your conduct. The gallows will be your doom yet.
You must not think because you are leagued in the
same traffic,<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>Dunn
kept one of the worst and most notorious drinking-shops
in Charleston, but, to reconcile his office with that strict requirement
which never allowed any thing "<emph>contrary to law</emph>" in
Charleston, he made his wife a "<emph>free trader</emph>." This special set of
South Carolina may in effect be classed among its many singular
laws. It has an exceedingly accommodating effect among bankrupt
husbands, and acts as a masked battery for innumerable
sins <emph>in a business or official line</emph>. It so happens, <emph>once in a while</emph>, that
one of the "<emph>fair free dealers</emph>" gets into limbo through the force of
some ruthless creditor; and the "Prison Bounds Act," being very
delicate in its bearings, frequently taxes the gallantry of the
chivalrous gentlemen of the Charleston bar.</p>
               </note>
that you are to go unpunished. And
you, Drydez," said he, turning to the Dutchman, "I
shall enter you upon the information docket, as soon
as I go down into the city."</p>
            <p>"Zeu may tu vat zeu plas mit me—te mayor
bees my friend, an' he knowz vot me ams. Yuz
sees zel no bronty, no zin! Vot yu to mit de fine,
ah?" *   *   *</p>
            <p>"I'd like to see you do that same agin Mr. ——.
It wouldn't be savin' yerself a pace-warrant, and
another for assault and battery! Sure magistrate Gyles
is a first-rate friend of me own, and he'd not suffer<pb n="128"/>
me imposed on. The d——d nigger was obstinate
and wouldn't go to jail," said Dunn in a cowardly,
whimpering manner.</p>
            <p>"Oh yez, me heard mit 'im swore, vat he no go to
zale!" rejoined the Dutchman anxiously.</p>
            <p>"Tell me none of your lies," said he; "you are
both the biggest rascals in town, and carry on your
concerted villany as boldly as if you had the control
of the city in your hands." Manuel was trembling
under the emotions of grief and revenge. His Portuguese
blood would have revenged itself at the
poniard's point, but fortunately he had left it in his
chest. He saw that he had a friend at his hand, and
with the earnestness of a child, resigned himself to
his charge.</p>
            <p>In a few minutes quiet was produced, and the gentleman
expressing a desire to know how the trouble
originated, inquired of Manuel how it was brought
about. But no sooner had he commenced his story,
than he was interrupted by Dunn asserting his right,
according to the laws of South Carolina, to make his
declaration, which could not be refuted by the negro's
statement, or even testimony at law; and in another
moment jumped up, and taking Manuel by the collar,
commanded him to come along to jail; and turning
to the gentleman, dared him to interfere with his
duty.</p>
            <p>"I know how you take people to jail, very well.
I'll now see that you perform that duty properly, and
not torture prisoners from place to place before you
get there. You inflict a worse punishment in taking
poor, helpless people to jail, than they suffer after
they get there!" said he; and immediately joined
Manuel and walked to the jail with him.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE OLD JAIL.</head>
            <p>THERE are three institutions in Charleston—either
of which would be a stain upon the name of civilization—standing
as emblems of the time-established
notions of a people, and their cherished love for the
ancestral relics of a gone-by age. Nothing could
point with more unerring aim than these sombre
monuments do, to the distance behind the age that
marks the thoughts and actions of the Charlestonians.
They are the poor-house, hospital, and jail; but as
the latter only pertains to our present subject, we
prefer to speak of it alone, and leave the others for
another occasion. The workhouse may be said to
form an exception—that being a new building, recently
erected upon a European plan. It is very spacious,
with an extravagant exterior, surmounted by lofty
semi-Gothic watch-towers, similar to the old castles
upon the Rhine. So great was the opposition to
building this magnificent temple of a workhouse, and
so inconsistent, beyond the progress of the age, was it
viewed by the "<emph>manifest ancestry</emph>," that it caused the
mayor his defeat at the following hustings. "<emph>Young
Charleston</emph>" was rebuked for its daring progress, and
the building is marked by the singular cognomen of
"Hutchinson's Folly." What is somewhat singular,
this magnificent building is exclusively for negroes.
One fact will show how progressive has been the
science of law to govern the negro, while those to<pb n="130"/>
which the white man is subjected are such as good
old England conferred upon them some centuries ago.
For felonious and burglarious offences, a white man is
confined in the common jail; then dragged to the
market-place, stripped, and whipped, that the negroes
may laugh "<emph>and go see buckra catch it</emph>;" while a
negro is sent to the workhouse, confined in his cell
for a length of time, and then whipped according to
modern science,—but nobody sees it <emph>except</emph> by special
permission. Thus the negro has the advantage of
science and privacy.</p>
            <p>The jail is a sombre-looking building, with every
mark of antiquity standing boldly outlined upon its
exterior. It is surrounded by a high brick wall, and
its windows are grated with double rows of bars, sufficiently
strong for a modern penitentiary. Altogether,
its dark, gloomy appearance strikes those who
approach it, with the thought and association of some
ancient cruelty. You enter through an iron-barred
door, and on both sides of a narrow portal leading to
the right are four small cells and a filthy-looking
kitchen, resembling an old-fashioned smoke-house.
These cells are the debtors'; and as we were passing out,
after visiting a friend, a lame "molatto-fellow" with
scarcely rags to cover his nakedness, and filthy beyond
description, stood at what was called the <term>kitchen door</term>.
"That poor dejected object," said our friend, "is the
cook. He is in for misdemeanor—one of the peculiar
shades of it, for which a nigger is honored with
the jail." "It seems, then, that cooking is a punishment
in CharleSton, and the negro is undergoing the
penalty," said we. "Yes!" said our friend; "but
the poor fellow has a sovereign consolation, which
few niggers in Charleston can boast of—and none of<pb n="131"/>
the prisoners here have—he can get enough to
eat."</p>
            <p>The poor fellow held out his hand as we passed him,
and said, "Massa, gin poor Abe a piece o' 'bacca'?"
We freely gave him all in our possession.</p>
            <p>On the left side, after passing the main iron door,
are the jailer's apartments. Passing through another
iron door, you ascend a narrow, crooked stairs and
reach the second story; here are some eight or nine
miserable cells—some large and some small—badly
ventilated, and entirely destitute of any kind of furniture:
and if they are badly ventilated for summer,
they are equally badly provided with means to warm
them in winter. In one of these rooms were nine or
ten persons, when we visited it; and such was the
morbid stench escaping from it, that we were compelled
to put our handkerchiefs to our faces. This
floor is appropriated for such crimes as assault and
battery; assault and battery, with intent to kill;
refractory seamen; deserters; violating the statutes;
suspicion of arson and murder; <emph>witnesses</emph>; all sorts of
crimes, varying from the debtor to the positive murderer,
burglar, and felon. We should have enumerated,
among the rest, all stewards, (colored,) whether foreign
or domestic, who are committed on that singular
charge, "<emph>contrary to law</emph>." And it should have been
added, <emph>even though cast away upon our "hospitable
shores."</emph> Among all these different shades of criminals,
there must be some very bad men. And we
could recount three who were pointed out to us, as
very dangerous men, yet were allowed the favor of
this floor and its associations. One was an Irish
sailor, who was sentenced to three years and nine
months' imprisonment by the United States court,<pb n="132"/>
for revolt and a desperate attempt to murder the
captain of a ship; the next was a German, a soldier
in the United States army, sentenced to one year and
eight months' imprisonment for killing his comrade;
and the third was an English sailor, who <emph>killed a woman</emph>—but
as she happened to be of doubtful character,
the presiding judge of the sessions sentenced him to
a <emph>light</emph> imprisonment, which the Governor very condescendingly
pardoned after a few weeks.</p>
            <p>The two former acted as attendants, or deputy
jailers; with the exception of turning the key, which
privilege the jailer reserved for himself exclusively.
The principle may seem a strange one, that places
men confined upon such grave charges in a superior
position over prisoners; and may be questionable with
regard to the discipline itself.</p>
            <p>From this floor, another iron door opened, and a winding
passage led into the third and upper story, where a
third iron door opened into a vestibule, on the right and
left of which were grated doors secured with heavy
bolts and bars. These opened into narrow portals
with dark, gloomy cells on each side. In the floor of
each of these cells was a large iron ring-bolt, doubtless
intended to chain refractory prisoners to; but we
were informed that such prisoners were kept in close
stone cells, in the yard, which were commonly occupied
by negroes and those condemned to capital
punishment. The ominous name of this third story
was "Mount Rascal," intended, no doubt, as significant
of the class of prisoners it contained. It is said that
genius is never idle: the floor of these cells bore some
evidence of the fact in a variety of very fine specimens
of carving and flourish work, done with a knife.
Among them was a well-executed crucifix; with the<pb n="133"/>
Redeemer, on Calvary—an emblem of hope, showing
how the man marked the weary moments of his
durance. We spoke with many of the prisoners, and
heard their different stories, some of which were
really painful. Their crimes were variously stated,
from that of murder, arson, and picking pockets,
down to the felon who had stolen a pair of shoes to
cover his feet; one had stolen a pair of pantaloons,
and a little boy had stolen a few door-keys. Three
boys were undergoing their sentence for murder. A
man of genteel appearance, who had been sentenced
to three years imprisonment, and to receive two
hundred and twenty lashes in the market, at different
periods, complained bitterly of the injustice of his
case. Some had been flogged in the market, and
were awaiting their time to be flogged again and
discharged; and others were confined on suspicion,
and had been kept in this close durance for more than
six months, awaiting trial. We noticed that this
worst of injustice, "the law's delay," was felt worse
by those confined on the suspicion of some paltry
theft, who, even were they found guilty by a jury,
would not have been subjected to more than one week
imprisonment. Yet such was the adherence to that
ancient system of English criminal jurisprudence, that
it was almost impossible for the most innocent person
to get a hearing, except at the regular sessions, "which
sit seldom, and with large intervals between." There
is indeed a city court in Charleston, somewhat more
modern in its jurisprudence than the sessions. It has
its city sheriff, and its city officers, and holds its
terms more frequently. Thus is Charleston doubly
provided with sheriffs and officials. Both aspire to
a distinct jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases.<pb n="134"/>
Prisoners seem mere shuttlecocks between the sheriffs,
with a decided advantage in favor of the county sheriff,
who is autocrat in rei over the jail; and any criminal
who has the good fortune to get a hearing before
the city judge, may consider himself under special
obligation to the county sheriff for the <emph>favor</emph>.</p>
            <p>We noticed these cells were much cleaner than
those below, yet there was a fetid smell escaping
from them. This we found arose from the tubs being
allowed to stand in the rooms, where the criminals
were closely confined, for twenty-four hours, which,
with the action of the damp, heated atmosphere of
that climate, was of itself enough to breed contagion.
We spoke of the want of ventilation and the noxious
fumes that seemed almost pestilential, but they
seemed to have become habituated to it, and told us
that the rooms on the south side were lighter and
more comfortable. Many of them spoke cheerfully,
and endeavored to restrain their feelings, but the
furrows upon their haggard countenances needed no
tongue to utter its tale.</p>
            <p>Hunger was the great grievance of which they
complained; and if their stories were true—and we
afterward had <emph>strong proofs</emph> that they were—there
was a wanton disregard of common humanity, and an
abuse of power the most reprehensible. The allowance
per day was a loaf of bad bread, weighing about
nine ounces, and a pint of thin, repulsive soup, so
nauseous that only the most necessitated appetite
could be forced to receive it, merely to sustain animal
life. This was served in a dirty-looking tin pan, without
even a spoon to serve it. One man told us that
he had subsisted on bread and water for nearly five
weeks—that he had lain down to sleep in the afternoon<pb n="135"/>
and dreamed that he was devouring some wholesome
nourishment to stay the cravings of his appetite, and
awoke to grieve that it was but a dream. In this
manner his appetite was doubly aggravated, yet he
could get nothing to appease its wants until the next
morning. To add to this cruelty, we found two
men in close confinement, the most emaciated and
abject specimens of humanity we have ever beheld.
We asked ourselves, "Lord God! was it to be that
humanity should descend so low?" The first was a
forlorn, dejected-looking creature, with a downcast
countenance, containing little of the human to mark
his features. His face was covered with hair, and so
completely matted with dirt and made fiendish by
the tufts of coarse hair that hung over his forehead,
that a thrill of horror invaded our feelings. He had
no shoes on his feet; and a pair of ragged pantaloons,
and the shreds of a striped shirt without sleeves,
secured around the waist with a string, made his only
clothing. In truth, he had scarce enough on to cover
his nakedness, and that so filthy and swarming with
vermin, that he kept his shoulders and hands busily
employed; while his skin was so incrusted with dirt
as to leave no trace of its original complexion. In
this manner he was kept closely confined, and was
more like a wild beast who saw none but his keepers
when they came to throw him his feed. Whether he
was kept in this manner for his dark deeds or to cover
the shame of those who speculated upon his misery,
we leave to the judgment of the reader.</p>
            <p>We asked this poor mortal what he had done to
merit such a punishment? He held his head down,
and motioned his fevered lips. "Speak out!" said
we, "perhaps we can get you out." "I had no shoes,<pb n="136"/>
and I took a pair of boots from the gentleman I
worked with," said he in a low, murmuring tone,</p>
            <p>"Gracious, man!" said we, "a pair of boots! and
is that all you are here for?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, sir! he lives on the wharf, is very wealthy,
and is a good man: 't wasn't his fault, because he
tried to get me out if I'd pay for the boots, but they
wouldn't let him."</p>
            <p>"And how long have you been thus confined?"
said we.</p>
            <p>"Better than five months—but it's because there
a'n't room up stairs. They've been promising me some
clothes for a long time, but they don't come," he
continued.</p>
            <p>"And how much longer have you to stop in this
condition?"</p>
            <p>"Well, they say 'at court sets in October; it's
somethin' like two months off; the grand jury'll visit
the jail then, and maybe they'll find a bill' against me,
and I'll be tried. I dont't care if they only don't flog
me in that fish-market."</p>
            <p>"Then you have not been tried yet? Well, may
God give that man peace to enjoy his bounty, who
would consign a poor object like thee to such cruelty!"
said we.</p>
            <p>"I was raised in Charleston—can neither read nor
write—I have no father, and my mother is crazy in
the poor-house, and I work about the city for a living,
when I'm out!" said he. There was food for reflection
in this poor fellow's simple story, which we found
to be correct, as corroborated by the jailer.</p>
            <p>"Do you get enough to eat?" we asked.</p>
            <p>"Oh no, indeed! I could eat twice as much—that's
the worst on't: 't wouldn't be bad only for that. I git<pb n="137"/>
me loaf' in the mornin', and me soup at twelve, but I
don't git nothin' to eat at night, and a feller's mighty
hungry afore it's time to lay down," said he.</p>
            <p>We looked around the room, and not seeing any
thing to sleep upon, curiosity led us to ask him where
he slept.</p>
            <p>"The jail allows us a blanket—that's mine in the
corner: I spread it at night when I wants to go to
bed," he answered, quite contentedly. We left the
poor wretch, for our feelings could withstand it no
longer. The state of society that would thus reduce
a human being, needed more pity than the calloused
bones reduced to such a bed. His name was Bergen.</p>
            <p>The other was a young Irishman, who had been
dragged to jail in his shirt, pantaloons, and hat, on
suspicion of having stolen seven dollars from a comrade.
He had been in jail very near four months,
and in regard to filth and vermin was a counterpart
of the other. A death-like smell, so offensive that
we stopped upon the threshold, escaped from the
room as soon as the door opened, enough to destroy a
common constitution, which his emaciated limbs bore
the strongest evidence of.</p>
            <p>The prisoners upon the second story were allowed
the privilege of the yard during certain hours in the
day, and the debtors at all hours in the day; yet, all
were subjected to the same fare. In the yard were a
number of very close cells, which, as we have said
before, were kept for negroes, refractory criminals,
and those condemned to capital punishment. These
cells seemed to be held as a terror over the criminals,
and well they might, for we never witnessed any
thing more dismal for the tenement of man.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">HOW IT IS.</head>
            <p>IT is our object to show the reader how many
gross abuses of power exist in Charleston, and to
point him to the source. In doing this, the task
becomes a delicate one, for there are so many things
we could wish were not so, because we know there
are many good men in the community whose feelings
are enlisted in the right, but their power is not
coequal; and if it were, it is checked by an opposite
influence.</p>
            <p>The more intelligent of the lower classes look upon
the subject of politics in its proper light—they see the
crashing effect the doctrine of nullification has upon
their interests; yet, though their numbers are not few,
their voice is small, and cannot sound through the channels
that make popular influence. Thus all <emph>castes</emph> of
society are governed by impracticable abstractions.</p>
            <p>The jail belongs to the county—the municipal
authorities have no voice in it; and the State, in its
legislative benevolence, has provided thirty cents a
day for the maintenance of each prisoner. This
small sum, in the State of South Carolina, where
provision is extremely high, may be considered as a
paltry pittance; but more especially so when the
magnificent pretensions of South Carolina are taken
into consideration, and a comparison is made between
this meagre allowance and that of other States. Even
Georgia, her sister State, and one whose plain modesty<pb n="139"/>
is really worthy of her enterprising citizens, takes a
more enlightened view of a criminal's circumstances—allows
forty-four cents a day for his maintenance,
and treats him as if he was really a human being.
But for this disparity and the wanton neglect of
humane feelings South Carolinians excuse themselves
upon the ground that they have no penitentiary; nor
do they believe in that system of punishment, contending
that it creates an improper competition with the
honest mechanic, and gives countenance to crime,
because it attempts to improve criminals. The
common jail is made the place of confinement, while
the whipping-post and starvation supply the correctives.</p>
            <p>The sheriff being created an absolute functionary,
with unlimited powers to control the jail in all its
varied functions, without either commissioners or jail-committee,
what state of management may be expected?
The court gives no specific direction as to the
apartment or mode of confinement when sentencing
a criminal; consequently, it becomes an established
fact that the legislative confidence deposed in the
sheriff is used as a medium of favors, to be dispensed
as best suits the feelings or interests of the incumbent.
Such power in the hands of an arbitrary, vindictive,
or avaricious man, affords unlimited means of abuse,
and without fear of exposure.</p>
            <p>It may be inferred from what we have said that
the jailer was relax in his duty. This is not the
case, for we have good authority that a more kind-hearted
and benevolent man never filled the office.
But his power was so restricted by those in absolute
control, that his office became a mere turnkey's duty,
for which he was paid the pittance of five hundred<pb n="140"/>
dollars a year or thereabouts. Thus he discharged his
duty according to the instructions of the sheriff, who,
it was well known, looked upon the jail as a means of
speculation; and in carrying out his purposes, he would
give very benevolent instructions in words, and at the
same time withhold the means of carrying them out,
like the very good man who always preached but
never practised.</p>
            <p>Now, how is it? What is the regimen of this jail-prison
and how is it provided? We will say nothing
of that arduous duty which the jailer performs for his
small sum; nor the report that the sheriff's office is
worth fourteen thousand dollars a year: these things
are too well established. But the law provides thirty
cents a day for the prisoner's maintenance, which
shall be received by the sheriff, who is to procure one
pound of good bread, and one pound of good beef per
day for each man. Now this provision is capable of
a very elastic construction. The poor criminal is
given a loaf of bad bread, costing about three cents,
and a pound of meat, the most unwholesome and
sickly in its appearance, costing five cents. Allowing
a margin, however, and we may say the incumbent
has a very nice profit of from eighteen to twenty
cents per day on each prisoner. But, as no provision
is made against the possibility of the criminal eating
his meat raw, he is very delicately forced to an alternative
which has another profitable issue for the
sheriff; that of taking a pint of diluted water, very
improperly called soup. Thus is carried out that
ancient law of England which even she is now
ashamed to own. Our feelings are naturally roused
against the perpetration of such abuses upon suffering
humanity. We struggle between a wish to speak<pb n="141"/>
well of her whose power it is to practise them, and
an imperative duty that commands us to speak for
those who cannot speak for themselves.</p>
            <p>These things could not exist if the public mind
was properly enlightened. It is unnecessary to spend
many words in exposing such palpable abuses, or to
trace the cause of their existence and continuance.
One cause of this is the wilful blindness and silly
gasconade of some of those who lead and form public
opinion. With South Carolinians, nothing is done in
South Carolina that is not greater than ever was
done in the United States—no battles were ever
fought that South Carolina did not win—no statesman
was ever equal to Mr. Calhoun—no confederacy
would be equal to the Southern, with South Carolina
at its head—no political doctrines contain so much
vital element as secession, and no society in the
Union is equal to South Carolina for caste and
elegance—not excepting the worthy and learned aristocracy
of Boston.</p>
            <p>A will to do as it pleases and act as it pleases,
without national restraint, is the great drawback
under which South Carolina sends forth her groaning
tale of political distress. Let her look upon her
dubious glory in its proper light—let her observe the
rights of others, and found her acts in justice!—annihilate
her grasping spirit, and she will find a power
adequate to her own preservation. She can then
show to the world that she gives encouragement to
the masses, and is determined to persevere in that
moderate and forbearing policy which creates its
own protection, merits admiration abroad, instead of
rebuke, and which needs no gorgeous military display
to marshal peace at the point of the bayonet.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
            <head type="sub">MANUEL PEREIRA COMMITTED.</head>
            <p>IT was nearly eleven o'clock as they ascended the
jail steps and rang the bell for admittance. The
jailer, a stout, rough-looking man, opened the iron
door, and as Manuel was about to step over the stone
sill, Dunn gave him a sudden push that sent him
headlong upon the floor. "Heavens! what now?"
inquired the jailer with a look of astonishment, and
at the next moment Dunn raised his foot to kick
Manuel in the face.</p>
            <p>"You infernal beast!" said the jailer, "you are
more like a savage than a man—you are drunk now,
you vagabond," and jumped in between them to save
him from the effect of the blow. As he did this, the
gentleman who accompanied them from the "corner-shop,"
as a protection against Dunn's cruelty, fetched
Dunn a blow on the back of the neck that made him
stagger against a door, and created such confusion
as to arouse the whole jail. Turning to Manuel, he,
with the assistance of the jailer, raised him from the
ground and led him into the jail-office. "Mister
jailer," said Dunn, "the prisoner is mine until such
times as you receipt the commitment, and I demand
protection from you against this man. He has committed
two violent assaults upon me, when I'd be
doing me duty."</p>
            <p>"You have violated all duty, and are more like an
incarnate fiend. You first decoy men into rum-shops,<pb n="143"/>
and then you plunder and abuse them, because you
think they are black and can get no redress. You
abused that man unmercifully, because you knew his
evidence was not valid against you!" said the gentleman,
turning to the jailer, and giving him the particulars
of what he saw in the "corner-shop," and what
cruelties he had seen practised by Dunn on former
occasions.</p>
            <p>The jailer looked upon Manuel with commiseration,
and handed him a chair to sit down on. The poor
fellow was excited and fatigued, for he had eaten
nothing that day, and been treated more like a brute
than a human being from the time, he left the ship
until he arrived at the jail. He readily accepted the
kind offer, and commenced to tell the story of his
treatment.</p>
            <p>"You need' not tell me,—I know too much of that
man already. It has long been a mystery to me why
he is retained in office."——</p>
            <p>Here Dunn interrupted. "Sure it's yer master I'd
obey and not yerself, an' I'd do what I'd plase with
prisoners, and, it's his business and not yeers. If ye
had yer way, sure you'd be makin' white men of
every nigger that ye turned a key upon."</p>
            <p>"Give me none of your insolence," said the jailer.
"You have no authority beyond my door. Your brutal
treatment to prisoners has caused me an immense
deal of trouble—more than my paltry pay would induce
me to stay for. Suppose you were indicted for
these outrages? What would be the result?" asked
the jailer.</p>
            <p>"Sure it's meself could answer for the sheriff, without
yer bothering yerself. I'd not work for yer, but
for him; and he's yer master anyhow, and knows all<pb n="144"/>
about it. Give me the receipt, and that's all I'd ax
yer. When a nigger don't mind me, I just makes him
feel the delight of a hickory stick."</p>
            <p>"Yes, if you had the shame of a man in you, you'd
not make a beast of yourself with liquor, and treat
these poor stewards as if they were dogs," said the
jailer.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, ye might learn a thing or two if ye was
a politician like meself, and belonged to the secession
party. An' if his honor the sheriff—for he's a
dacent man—knew ye'd be preachin' in that shape,
ye wouldn't keep the jail f'nent the morning. Be
letting me out, and make much of the nigger; ye
have him there."</p>
            <p>The jailer unlocked the door and allowed him to
pass out, with a pertinent rebuke. This was but a
trifling affair in Dunn's ear, for he knew his master's
feelings too well, and was backed by him in his most
intolerable proceedings. Returning to the office, he
looked at the commitment, and then again at Manuel.
"This is a 'contrary to law' case, I see, Mr. Manuel;
you are a likely fellow too, to come within that,"
said he.</p>
            <p>"Yes. If I understand him right, he's a shipwrecked
sailor, belonging to a foreign vessel that was
driven in here in distress," said the man. "It's a
hard law that imprisons a colored seaman who comes
here voluntarily; but it seems beyond all manner of
precedent to imprison a shipwrecked man like this,
especially when he seems so respectable. There are
no circumstances to warrant the enforcement of such
a law." Thus saying, he left the jail.</p>
            <p>Be it said of the jailer, to his honor, so far as personal
kindness went, he did his utmost—brought him<pb n="145"/>
water to wash himself, and gave him some clean clothes.
After which, he was registered upon the criminal calendar
as follows:—</p>
            <p>"March 24, 1852.—Manuel Peirire.—[Committed
by] Sheriff —— Sheriff. Crime—<hi>Contrary to
law.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Now the jailer had done his duty,. so far as his
feelings were concerned; but, such were the stern requirements
of the law, and his functions so restricted
by Mr. Grimshaw, that he dare not make distinctions.
He called Daley, one of the criminal assistants, and
ordered him to show the prisoner his room.</p>
            <p>"Here, my boy, take yer blanket," said Daley;
and throwing him a coarse, filthy-looking blanket,
told him to roll it up and follow him. "It's on the
second floor we'll put ye, among the stewards; there's
a nice lot on 'em to keep yer company, and ye'll have
a jolly time, my boy." Manuel followed through the
second iron door until he came to a large door secured
with heavy bolts and bars, which Daley began to
withdraw and unlock. "Don't be takin' it amiss;
it's a right good crib, savin' the' bed, an' it's that's
the worst of it. Bad luck to old Grimshaw, an'
himself thinks everybody's bones be's as tuf as his
own," said Daley, and threw open the heavy doors,
sending forth those ominous prison sounds. "All
here? Ah! yer a pretty set of lambs, as the British
consul calls yees. Have ye ever a drop to spare?"
At this, three or four respectable-looking black men
came to the door and greeted Manuel. "Come, talk
her out, for th' auld man'll be on the scent." At
this, one of the confined stewards, a tall, good-looking
mulatto man, ran his hand into a large opening in
the wall, and drew forth a little soda-bottle filled with<pb n="146"/>
Monongahela whisky. Without giving reasonable
time for politeness, Daley seized the bottle, and putting
it to his mouth, gauged about half its contents
into his homony depôt, smacked his lips, wiped his
mouth with his cuff, and, passing the balance back,
shut and rebolted the door, after saying, "Good luck
till yees, an' I wish yees a merry time." The reader
may imagine what provision the State or the sheriff
had made for the comfort of these poor men, one of
whom was imprisoned because it was "contrary to
law" to be driven into the port of Charleston in distress,
and the rest, peaceable, unoffending citizens
belonging to distant States and countries, and guilty
of no crime, when we describe the room and regimen
to which they were subjected. The room was about
twenty-six feet long and ten feet wide. The brick
walls were plastered and colored with some kind of blue
wash, which, however, was so nearly obliterated with
dirt and the damp of a southern climate, as to leave
but little to show what its original color was. The
walls were covered with the condensed moisture of
the atmosphere, spiders hung their festooned network
overhead, and cockroaches and ants, those domesticated
pests of South Carolina, were running about
the floor in swarms, and holding all legal rights to
<emph>rations</emph> in superlative contempt. Two small apertures
in the wall, about fourteen inches square, and double-barred
with heavy flat iron, served to admit light and
air. The reader may thus judge of its gloomy appearance,
and what a miserable unhealthy cell it
must have been in which to place men just arrived
from sea. There was not the first vestige of furniture
in the room, not; even a bench to sit upon, for the
State, with its gracious hospitality, forgot that men in<pb n="147"/>
jail ever sit down; but it was in keeping with all other
things that the State left to the control of its officials.</p>
            <p>"Am I to be punished in this miserable place?
Why, I cannot see where I'm going; and have I nothing
to lay down upon but the floor, and that creeping
with live creatures?" inquired Manuel of those who
were already inured to the hardship.</p>
            <p>"Nothing! nothing! Bring your mind to realize
the worst, and forget the cruelty while you are suffering
it; they let us out a part of the day. We are
locked up to-day because one of the assistants stole
my friend's liquor, and he dared to accuse him of the
theft, because he was a white man," said a tall, fine-looking
mulatto man by the name of James Redman,
who was steward on board a Thomastown (Maine) ship,
and declared that he had visited Charleston on a former
occasion, and by paying five dollars to one of
the officers, remained on board of the ship unmolested.</p>
            <p>"And how long shall I have to suffer in this manner?"
inquired Manuel. "Can I not have my own
bed and clothing?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes," said Redman; "you can have them,
but if you bring them here, they'll not be worth anything
when you leave; and the prisoners upon this
floor are so starved and destitute, that necessity forces
them to steal whatever comes in their way; and the
assistants are as much implicated as the prisoners.
You'll fare hard; but just do as we do in a calm,
wait for the wind to blow, and pray for the best. If
you say any thing, or grumble about it, the sheriff
will order you locked, up on the third story, and that's
worse than death itself. The first thing you do, make
preparations for something to eat. We pay for it<pb n="148"/>
here, but don't get it; and you'd starve afore you'd
eat what they give them poor white prisoners. They
suffer worse than we do, only they have cleaner
rooms. "</p>
            <p>"I pray for my deliverance from such a place as
this."</p>
            <p>His manners and appearance at once enlisted the
respect of those present, and they immediately set to
work, with all the means at hand, to make him comfortable.
Joseph Jociquei, a young man who had
been taken from a vessel just arrived from Rio, and
was more fortunate than the rest, in having a mattrass,
seeing Manuel's weak condition, immediately removed
it from its place, and spreading it upon the floor, invited
him to lay down. The invitation was as acceptable
as it was kind on the part of Jociquei, and
the poor fellow laid his weary limbs upon it, and
almost simultaneously fell into a profound sleep.
Manuel continued to sleep. His face and head
were scarred in several places; which were dressed and
covered with pieces of plaster that the jailer had supplied.
His companions, for such we shall call those
who were confined with him, sat around him, discussing
the circumstances that brought him there, and
the manner in which they could best relieve his suffering.
"It's just as I was sarved," said Redman.
"And I'll bet that red-headed constable, Dunn,
brought him up: and abused him in all them Dutch
shops. I didn't know the law, and he made me give
him three dollars not to put the handcuffs upon me,
and then I had to treat him in every grog-shop we
came to. Yes, and the last shop we were in, he throw'd
liquor in me face, cursed the Dutchman that kept the
shop, kick'd me, and tried every way in the world to<pb n="149"/>
raise a fuss. If I hadn't know'd the law here too
well, I'd whipt him sure. I have suffered the want
of that three dollars since I bin here. 'Twould
sarved me for coffee. We have neither coffee nor
bread to-night, for we gave our allowance of bad
bread to the white prisoners, but we must do something
to make the poor fellow comfortable. I know
the constable has kept him all day coming up, and
he'll be hungry as soon as he awakes."</p>
            <p>"Won't he receive his allowance to-day like another
prisoner?" inquired Copeland, a thick-set, well
made, dark-skinned negro steward, who had formerly
conducted a barber shop in Fleet street, Boston,
but was now attached to the schooner Oscar Jones,
Kellogg, master.</p>
            <p>"Oh! no, sir," said Redman, "that's against the
rules of the jail—every thing is done by rule here,
even to paying for what we don't get, and starving
the prisoners. A man that don't come in before eleven
o'clock gets no ration until the next morning. I know,
because I had a fuss with the jailer about it, the first
day I was brought in; but he gin me a loaf out of
his own house. The old sheriff never allows any thing
done outside the rules, for he's tighter than a mantrap.
'T a'n't what ye suffers in this cell, but it's what
ye don't get to eat; and if that poor feller a'n't got
money, he'll wish himself alongside the caboose again
'fore he gets out." The poor fellows were driven to
the extreme of providing sustenance to sustain life.
They mustered their little means together, and by
giving a sum to the sheriff's black boy, (a man more
intelligent, gentlemanly, and generous-hearted than his
master,) had a measure of coffee, sugar, and bread
brought in. Necessity was the mother of invention<pb n="150"/>
with them, for they had procured a barrel for twenty-five
cents, and made it supply the place of a table. With a
few chips that were brought to them by a kind-hearted
colored woman that did their washing, and bestowed
many little acts of kindness, they made a fire, endured
the annoyance of a dense smoke from the old fire-place,
and prepared their little supper. As soon as it was
upon the table, they awoke Manuel, and invited him
to join in their humble fare. The poor fellow arose,
and looking around the gloomy, cavern-like place,
heaved a deep sigh. "It's hard to be brought to this
for nothing!" said he; "and my bones are so sore
that I can scarcely move. I must see the Captain and
consul."</p>
            <p>"That won't do any good; you might as well keep
quiet and drink your coffee. A prisoner that says
the least in this jail is best off," returned Redman.</p>
            <p>Manuel took his bowl of coffee and a piece of
bread, eating it with a good appetite, and asking what
time they got breakfast. "It's the first time I was
abused in a foreign country. I'm Portuguese, but a
citizen of Great Britain, and got my protection.—When
it won't save me, I'll never come to South
Carolina again, nor sail where a flag won't protect me.
When I go among Patagonians, I know what they do;
but when I sail to United States or be cast away on
them, I don't know what they do, because I expect
good people." *   *   *</p>
            <p>"Never mind, my good fellow," said Redman;
"cheer up, take it as a good sailor would a storm, and
in the morning you'll get a small loaf of sour bread
and a bucket of water for breakfast, if you go to the
pump for it. Be careful to moderate your appetite
when you breakfast according to the State's rules;<pb n="151"/>
for you must save enough to last you during the day,
and if you can keep "banyan day," as the Bluenose
calls it, you're just the man for this institution, and
no mistake. Come, I see you're hungry; drink another
bowl of coffee, and eat plenty of bread; then you'll
be all right for another good sleep."</p>
            <p>"Yes, but I don't expect to be in here long. But
tell me, do we get nothing more than a loaf? didn't
the jail give us this supper?" he inquired with surprise.</p>
            <p>"Supper, indeed!—it's against the rules for prisoners
to have coffee; that's our private fixings; but
you'll get a pound of bloody neck-bone, they call beef,
in the morning. I have twice thrown mine to the
dog, but he doesn't seem to thank me for it; so I told
the cook he needn't trouble his steelyards for me
again."</p>
            <p>Redman's conversation was interrupted by a noise
that seemed to be a ring of the prison bell, and an
anxious expression which Manuel gave utterance to,
indicated that he expected somebody would come to
see him. He was not disappointed, for a few minutes
after, the bolts were heard to withdraw and the heavy
door swung back. There, true to his charge, was little
Tommy, in his nicest blue rig, tipped off a la man-o'-war
touch, with his palmetto-braid hat,—a long
black ribbon displayed over the rim,—his hair combed
so slick, and his little round face and red cheeks so
plump and full of the sailor-boy pertness, with his
blue, braided shirt-collar laid over his jacket, and set
off around the neck, with a black India handkerchief,
secured at the throat with the joint of a shark's backbone.
He looked the very picture and pattern of a
Simon-Pure salt. He had wended his way through
strange streets and lanes, with a big haversack under<pb n="152"/>
his arm, which Daley had relieved him of at the door,
and brought into the room under his arm. As soon as
Manuel caught a glimpse of him, he rose and clasped the
little fellow in his arms with a fond embrace. No
greeting could be more affecting. Manuel exulted at
seeing his little companion; but Tommy looked grieved,
and asked, "But what has scarred your face so, Manuel?
You didn't look that way when you left the brig.
We have had a site o' folks down to see us to-day."</p>
            <p>"Oh, that's nothing!—just a little fall I got; don't
tell the Captain: it'll all be well to-morrow."</p>
            <p>"Here, Jack, take your knapsack; did yer bring
ever a drop o' liquor for the steward?" said Daley,
addressing himself to Tommy, and putting the package
upon the floor.</p>
            <p>"Yes, Manuel!" said Tommy, "the Captain sent
you some nice bread and ham, some oranges and raisins,
and a bottle of nice claret,—for he was told by
the consul that they didn't give 'em nothing to eat
at the jail. And I had a tug with 'em, I tell you. I
got lost once, and got a good-natured black boy to
pilot me for a Victoria threepence,—but he did not
like to carry the bundle to the jail, for fear of his master.
Captain 'll be up first thing in the morning, if
he can get away from business," said the little tar,
opening the haversack and pulling out its contents to
tempt the hungry appetites of those around him.</p>
            <p>Daley very coolly took the bottle of claret by the
neck, and holding it between himself and the light,
took a lunar squint at it, as if doubting its contents;
and then, putting it down, exclaimed, "Ah! the divil
a red I'd give you for your claret. Sure, why didn't ye
bring a token of good old hardware?" "Hardware!
what is hardware?" inquired Manuel. "Ah! <orig>bothera-</orig>
               <pb n="153"/>
tion to the bunch of yees—a drap of old whiskey,
that 'd make the delight cum f'nent. Have ye ne'er
a drap among the whole o' yees?" Receiving an answer
in the negative, he turned about with a Kilkenny,
"It don't signify," and toddled for the door, which he
left open, to await Tommy's return. Redman knew
Daley's propensity too well, and having ocular proof
that he had wet <emph>t'other eye</emph> until it required more than
ordinary effort to make either one stay open, he declined
recognising his very significant hint.</p>
            <p>As soon as Daley withdrew, Manuel invited his
companions to partake of the Captain's present, which
they did with general satisfaction.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE LAW'S INTRICACY.</head>
            <p>WHILE the scenes we have described in the foregoing
chapter were being performed, several very
interesting ones were going through the course of
performance at the consul's office and other places,
which we must describe. The British Government,
in its instructions to Mr. Mathew, impressed upon
him the necessity of being very cautious lest he
should in any manner prejudice the interests of the
local institutions within his consular jurisdiction; to
make no requests that were incompatible with the
local laws; but to pursue a judicious course in bringing
the matter of Her Majesty's subjects properly
to the consideration of the legal authorities, and to
point to the true grievance; and as it involved a<pb n="154"/>
question of right affecting the interests and liberties
of her citizens, to ask the exercise of that judicial
power from which it had a right to expect justice.
The main object was to test the question whether this
peculiar construction given to that local law which
prohibits free colored men from coming within the
limits of the State, was legal in its application to those
who come into its ports connected with the shipping
interests, pursuing an honest vocation, and intending
to leave whenever their ship was ready. The consul
was censured by the press in several of the slaveholding
States, because he dared to bring the matter
before the local legislature. We are bound to say
that Consul Mathew, knowing the predominant prejudices
of the Carolinians, acted wisely in so doing.
First, he knew the tenacious value they put upon
courtesy; secondly, the point at issue between South
Carolina and the Federal Government, (and, as a
learned friend in Georgia once said, "<emph>Whether South
Carolina belonged to the United States, or the United
States to South Carolina</emph>;") and thirdly, the right of
State sovereignty, which South Carolina held to be of
the first importance. To disregard the first, would
have been considered an insult to the feelings of her
people; and if the question had first been mooted
with the Federal Government, the ire of South Carolinians
would have been fired; the slur in placing her
in a secondary position would have sounded the war-trumpet
of Abolition encroachments, while the latter
would have been considered a breach of confidence,
and an unwarrantable disregard of her assertion of
State rights. The Executive transmitted the documents
to the Assembly, that body referred them to
special committees, and the Messrs. Mazyck and<pb n="155"/>
McCready, reported as <emph>everybody</emph> in South Carolina
expected, virtually giving the British consul a very
significant invitation to keep his petitions in his pocket
for the future, and his "<emph>black lambs</emph>" out of the State,
or it might disturb their domesticated ideas. Thus
was the right clearly reserved to themselves, and the
question settled, so far as the State Legislature was
concerned. The next course for Mr. Mathew was to
appeal to the Judiciary, and should redress be denied,
make it the medium of bringing the matter, before the
Federal courts.</p>
            <p>We cannot forbear to say, that the strenuous opposition
waged against this appeal of common humanity
arose from political influence, supported by a
set of ultra partisans, whose theoretical restrictions,
assisted by the voice of the press, catered to the war-spirit
of the abstractionists.</p>
            <p>The British consul, as the representative of his
government, knowing the personal suffering to which
the subjects of his country were subjected by the
wretched state of the Charleston prison, and its
management, sought to remove no restriction that
might be necessary for protecting their dangerous
institutions, but to relieve that suffering. He had
pointed the authorities to the wretched state of
the prison, and the inhuman regimen which existed
within it; but, whether through that superlative carelessness
which has become so materialized in the spirit
of society—that callousness to misfortune so strongly
manifested by the rich toward the industrious poor
and the slaves—or, a contempt for his opinions, because
he had followed out the instructions of his government,
things went on in the same neglected
manner and no attention was paid to them.</p>
            <pb n="156"/>
            <p>Now, we dare assert that a large, portion of the
excitement which the question has caused has arisen
from personal suffering, consequent upon that wretched
state of jail provisions which exists in South Carolina,
and which, to say the least, is degrading to the
spirit and character of a proud people. If a plea
could be made, for excuse, upon the shattered finances
of the State, we might tolerate something of the
abuse. But this is not the case; and when its privileges
become reposed in men who make suffering the
means to serve their own interests, its existence becomes
an outrage.</p>
            <p>A stronger evidence of the cause of these remonstrances
on the part of the British Government, is
shown by the manner in which it has been submitted
to in Georgia. The British consul of the port of
Savannah, a gentleman whose intelligence and humane
feelings are no less remarkable than Mr. Mathew's, has
never had occasion to call the attention of the Executive
of Georgia to the <emph>abuse</emph> of power consequent upon
the imprisonment of colored seamen belonging to the
ships of Great Britain in that port. The seaman
was imprisoned, consequently deprived of his liberty;
but there was no suffering attendant beyond the loss
of liberty during the stay of the vessel; for the imprisonment
itself was a nominal thing; the imprisoned
was well cared for; he had good, comfortable apartments,
cleanly and well ordered, away from the
criminals, and plenty of good, wholesome food to eat.
There was even a satisfaction in this, for the man got
what he paid for, and was treated as if he were really
a human being. Thus, with the exception of the
restriction on the man's liberty, and that evil, which
those interested in commerce would reflect upon as a<pb n="157"/>
tax upon the marine interests of the port to support
a municipal police, because it imposes a tax and burdensome
annoyance upon owners for that which they
have no interest in and can derive no benefit from,
the observance of the law had more penalty in mental
anxiety than bodily suffering. We have sometimes
been at a loss to account for the restriction, even as
it existed in Georgia, and especially when we consider
the character of those controlling and developing the
enterprising commercial affairs of Savannah.</p>
            <p>But we must return to South Carolina. If we view
this law as a police regulation, it only gives us broader
latitude. If a community has that within itself
which is dangerous to its well-being, it becomes pertinent
to inquire whether there is not an imperfect state
of society existing, and whether this policy is not injurious
to the well-being of the State. The evil,
though it be a mortifying fact, we are bound to say,
arises from a strange notion of caste and color, which
measures sympathy according to complexion. There
is no proof that can possibly be adduced, showing that
colored seamen have made any infections among the
slaves, or sought to increase the dangers of her peculiar
institution.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
            <head type="sub">PLEA OF JUST CONSIDERATION AND MISTAKEN CONSTANCY OF
THE LAWS.</head>
            <p>THE consul's office opened at nine o'clock,—the
Captain, with his register-case and shipping papers
under his arm, presented himself to Mr. Mathew,
handed him his papers, and reported his condition.
That gentleman immediately set about rendering every
facility to relieve his immediate wants and further his
business. The consul was a man of plain, unassuming
manners, frank in his expressions, and strongly imbued
with a sense of his rights, and the faith of his
Government,—willing to take an active part in obtaining
justice, and, a deadly opponent to wrong, regardless
of the active hostility that surrounded him. After
relating the incidents of his voyage, and the circumstances
connected with Manuel's being dragged to
prison,—"Can it be possible that the law is to be carried
to such an extreme?" said he, giving vent to his
feelings.</p>
            <p>"Your people seem to have a strange manner of
exhibiting their hospitality," said the Captain, in reply.</p>
            <p>"That is true; but it will not do to appeal to the
officials." Thus saying, the consul prepared the certificate,
and putting on his hat, repaired to the jail.
Here he questioned Manuel upon the circumstances
of his arrest, his birthplace, and several other things.
"I am not sure that I can get you out, Manuel, but
I will do my best; the circumstances of your being<pb n="159"/>
driven in here in distress will warrant some consideration
in your case; yet the feeling is not favorable,
and we cannot expect much."</p>
            <p>From thence he proceeded to the office of Mr.
Grimshaw, where he met that functionary, seated in
all the dignity of his office.</p>
            <p>"Good morning, Mr. Consul. Another of your
darkies in my place, this morning," said Mr. Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"Yes; it is upon that business I have called to see
you. I think you could not have considered the condition
of this man, nor his rights, or you would not
have imprisoned him. Is there no way by which I
can relieve him?" inquired the consul, expecting little
at his hands, but venturing the effort.</p>
            <p>"Sir! I never do any thing inconsistent with my
office. The law gives me power in these cases, and
I exercise it according to my judgment. It makes
no exceptions for shipwrecks, and I feel that you
have no right to question me in the premises. It's
<emph>contrary to law</emph> to bring niggers here; and if you can
show that he is a white man, there's the law; but
you must await its process."</p>
            <p>"But do you not make exceptions?" inquired the
consul. "I do not wish to seek his relief by process
of law; that would increase expense and delay. I
have made the request as a favor; if you cannot consider
it in that light, I can only say my expectations
are disappointed. But how is it that the man was
abused by your officers before he was committed?"</p>
            <p>"Those are things I've nothing to do with; they
are between the officers and your niggers. If they
are stubborn, the officers must use force, and we have
a right to iron the whole of them. Your niggers give<pb n="160"/>
more trouble than our own, and are a set of unruly
fellows. We give 'em advantages which they don't
deserve, in allowing them the yard at certain hours
of the day. You Englishmen are never satisfied with
any thing we do," returned Mr. Grimshaw, with indifference,
appearing to satisfy himself that the law gave
him the right to do what he pleased in the premises.
There seemed but one idea in his head, so far as niggers
were concerned, nor could any mode of reasoning
arouse him: to a consideration of any extenuating circumstances.
A nigger was a nigger with him, whether
white or black—a creature for hog, homony, and
servitude.</p>
            <p>"I expected little and got nothing. I might have
anticipated it, knowing the fees you make by imprisonment.
I shall seek relief for the man through
a higher tribunal, and I shall seek redress for the
repeated abuses inflicted upon these men by your
officers," said the consul, turning to the door.</p>
            <p>"You can do that, sir," said Mr. Grimshaw; "but
you must remember that it will require white evidence
to substantiate the charge. We don't take the testimony
of your niggers."</p>
            <p>Just as the consul left the office, he met Colonel
S—— entering. The colonel always manifested a
readiness to relieve the many cases of oppression and
persecution arising from bad laws and abused official
duty. He had called upon Mr. Grimshaw on the
morning of the arrest, and received from him an
assurance that the case would be considered, the most
favorable construction given to it, and every thing
done for the man that was in his power. Notwithstanding
this to show how far confidence could be
put in such assurances, we have only to inform the<pb n="161"/>
reader that he had despatched the officers an hour
previously.</p>
            <p>The colonel knew his man, and felt no hesitation
at speaking his mind. Stepping up to him, "Mr.
Grimshaw," said he, "how do you reconcile your
statement and assurances to me this morning with
your subsequent conduct?"</p>
            <p>"That's my business. I act for the State, and
not for you. Are you counsel for these niggers, that
you are so anxious to set them at liberty among our
slaves? You seem to have more interest in it than
that interfering consul. Just let these Yankee niggers
and British niggers out to-night, and we'd have
another insurrection before morning; it's better to
prevent than cure," said Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"The only insurrection would have been in your
heart, for the loss of fees. If you did not intend
what you said, why did you deceive me with such
statements? I know the feelings of our people, as
well as I do yours for caging people within that jail.
Upon that, I intimated to the Captain what I thought
would be the probable result, and this morning I proceeded
to his vessel to reassure him, upon your statement.
Imagine my mortification when he informed me
that his steward had been dragged off to jail early in
the morning, and that those two ruffians whom you disgrace
the community with, behaved in the most outrageous
manner. It is in your power to relieve this
man, and I ask it as a favor, and on behalf of what I
know to be the feelings of the citizens of Charleston."</p>
            <p>"Your request, colonel," said Mr. Grimshaw, with
a little more complacency, "is too much in the shape
of a demand. There's no discretion left me by the
State, and if you have a power superior to that, you<pb n="162"/>
better pay the expenses of the nigger, and take the
management into your own hands. I never allow
this trifling philanthropy about niggers to disturb me.
I could never follow out the laws of the State and
practise it; and you better not burden yourself with
it, or your successors may suffer for adequate means
to support themselves. Now, sir, take my advice.
It's <emph>contrary to law</emph> for them niggers to come here;
you know our laws cannot be violated. South Carolina
has a great interest at stake in maintaining the
reputation of her laws. Don't excite the nigger's
anxiety, and he'll be better off in jail than he would
running about among the wenches. He won't have
luxuries, but we'll make him comfortable, and he
must suit his habits to our way of living. We must
not set a bad example before our own niggers; the
whiter they are the worse they are. They struggle
for their existence now, and think they're above observing
our nigger laws. We want to get rid of them,
and you know it," returned Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"Yes; I know it too well, for I have had too many
cases to protect them from being '<emph>run off</emph>' and sold
in the New Orleans market. But when you speak of
white niggers, I suppose you mean our brightest; I
dispute your assertion, and point you to my proof in
the many men of wealth among them now pursuing
their occupations in our city. Can you set an example
more praiseworthy? And notwithstanding
they are imposed upon by taxes, and many of our
whites take the advantage of law to withhold the
payment of debts contracted with them, they make
no complaint. They are subject to the same law
that restricts the blackest slave. Where is the
white man that would not have yielded under such<pb n="163"/>
inequality? No! Mr. Grimshaw, I am as true a
Southerner—born and bred—as you are; but I have
the interests of these men at heart, because I know
they are with us, and their interests and feelings are
identical with our own. They are Native Americans
by birth and blood, and we have no right to dispossess
them by law of what we have given them by blood.
We destroy their feelings by despoiling them of their
rights, and by it we weaken our own cause. Give
them the same rights and privileges that we extend
to that miserable class of foreigners who are spreading
pestilence and death over our social institutions, and
we would have nothing to fear from them, but rather
find them our strongest protectors. I want to see a
law taking from that class of men the power to lord
it over and abuse them.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>A
friend, who has resided several years in Charleston, strong
in his feelings of Southern rights, and whose keen observation
could not fail to detect the working of different phases of the slave
institution, informed us that he had conversed with a great many
very intelligent and enterprising men belonging to that large class
of "<emph>bright</emph>" men in Charleston, and that which appeared to pain
them most was the manner they were treated by foreigners of the
lowest class; that rights which they had inherited by birth and
blood were taken away from them; that, being subjected to the same
law which governed the most abject slave, every construction of
it went to degrade them, while it gave supreme power to the most
degraded white to impose upon them, and exercise his vindictive
feelings toward them; that no consideration being given to
circumstances, the least deviation from the police regulations made
to govern negroes, was taken advantage of by the petty guardmen,
who either extorted a fee to release them, or dragged them to the
police-office, where their oath was nothing, even if supported by
testimony of their own color; but the guardman's word was taken
as positive proof. Thus the laws of South Carolina forced them
to be what their feelings revolted at.</p>
               </note> And I want to see another<pb n="164"/>
making it a penal offence for those men holding slaves
for breeding purposes. Another, which humanity calls
for louder than any other, is one to regulate their
food, punish these grievous cases of starvation, and
make the offender suffer for withholding proper
rations."</p>
            <p>"Well—pretty well!" said Grimshaw, snapping
his fingers very significantly. "You seem to enjoy
the independence of your own opinion, colonel. Just
prove this nigger's a white, and I'll give you a release
for him, after paying the fees. You better move to
Massachusetts, and preach that doctrine to William
Lloyd Garrison and Abby Kelly."</p>
            <p>"Give me none of your impudence, or your low
insults. You may protect yourself from personal
danger by your own consciousness that you are beneath
the laws of honor; but that will not save you
from what you deserve, if you repeat your language.
Our moderation is our protection, while such unwise
restrictions as you would enforce, fan the flame of
danger to our own households," said the colonel, evidently
yielding to his impulses; while Mr. Grimshaw
sat trembling, and began to make a slender apology,
saying that the language was forced upon him, because
the colonel had overstepped the bounds of propriety
in his demands.</p>
            <p>"I'm somewhat astonished at your demand, colonel,
for you don't seem to comprehend the law, and the
imperative manner in which I'm bound to carry it out.
Shipowners should get white stewards, if they want to
avoid all this difficulty. I know the nature of the
case, but we can't be accountable for storms, shipwrecks,
old vessels, and all these things. I'll go and
see the fellow to-morrow, and tell the jailer—he's a<pb n="165"/>
pattern of kindness, and that's why I got him for
jailer—to give him good rations and keep his room
clean," said Grimshaw, getting up and looking among
some old books that lay on a dusty shelf. At length
he found the one, and drawing it forth, commenced
brushing the dust from it with a dust-brush, and turning
his tobacco-quid. After brushing the old book
for a length of time, he gave it a scientific wipe with
his coat-sleeve, again sat down, and commenced turning
over its pages.</p>
            <p>"It's in here, somewhere," said he, wetting his
finger and thumb at every turn.</p>
            <p>"What's in there, pray? You don't think I've
practised at the Charleston bar all my life without
knowing a law which has called up so many questions?"
inquired the colonel.</p>
            <p>"Why, the act and the amendments. I believe
this is the right one. I a'n't practised so long, that
I reckon I've lost the run of the appendix and everything
else," adding another stream of tobacco-spit to
the puddle on the floor.</p>
            <p>"That's better thought than said. Perhaps you'd
better get a schoolboy to keep his finger on it," continued
the colonel, laconically.</p>
            <p>"Well, well; but I must find it and refresh your
memory. Ah! here it is, and it's just as binding on
me as it can be. There's no mistake about it—it's
genuine South Carolina, perfectly aboveboard."
Thus saying, he commenced reading to the colonel as
if he was about to instruct a schoolboy in his rudiments.
"Here it is—a very pretty specimen of enlightened
legislation—born in the lap of freedom,
cradled in a land of universal rights, and enforced by
the strong arm of South Carolina."</p>
            <pb n="166"/>
            <p>"An Act for the better regulation and government
of free negroes and persons of color, and for other
purposes," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., Mr. Grimshaw read; but as
the two first sections are really a disgrace to the delegated
powers of man, in their aim to oppress the man
of color, we prefer to pass to the third section, and
follow Mr. Grimshaw as he reads:—</p>
            <p>"That if any vessel shall come into any port or
harbor of this State, (South Carolina,) from any other
State or foreign port, having on board any free negroes
or persons of color, as cooks, stewards, or
mariners, or in any other employment on board said
vessel, such free negroes or persons of color shall be
liable to be seized and confined in jail until said vessel
shall clear out and depart from this State; and that
when said vessel is ready to sail, the captain of said
vessel shall be bound to carry away the said free
negro or person of color, and pay the expenses of
detention; and in case of his refusal or neglect to do
so, he shall be liable to be indicted, and, on conviction
thereof, shall be fined in a sum not less than one
thousand dollars, and imprisoned not less than two
months; and such free negroes or persons of color
shall be deemed and taken as absolute slaves, and
sold in conformity to the provisions of the act passed
on the twentieth day of December, one thousand eight
hundred and twenty aforesaid.'"</p>
            <p>Mr. Grimshaw's coolness in the matter became so
intolerable, that the colonel could stand it no longer;
so, getting up while Mr. Grimshaw was reading the
law, he left the office, perfectly satisfied that further
endeavors at that source would be fruitless.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Grimshaw had concluded, he looked up,
perfectly amazed to find that he was enjoying the<pb n="167"/>
reading of the act to himself. "Had I not given it
all the consideration of my power, and seen the correctness
of the law, I should not have given so much
importance to my opinion. But there it is, all in that
section of the Act, and they can't find no convention
in the world to control the Legislature of South Carolina.
There's my principles, and all the Englishmen
and Abolitionists in Christendom wouldn't change
me. Now, I've the power, and let 'em get the nigger
out of my place, if they can," said Grimshaw, shutting
the book, kicking a good-sized, peaceable-looking dog
that lay under the table, and deliberately taking his
hat and walking into the street.</p>
            <p>Here is an Act, bearing on its face the arrogant will
of South Carolina, setting aside all constitutional
rights, and denying the validity of stipulations made
by the United States in her general commercial laws.
She asserts her right to disregard citizenship, to make
criminals of colored men, because they are colored,
and to sell them for slaves to pay the expenses which
she had incurred to make them such. And what
is still worse, is, that the exercise of this misconceived
and unjust law is so unrelentingly enforced, and so
abused by those who carry it out.</p>
            <p>During this time the consul had been unremitting
in his endeavors to procure the man's release. The
mayor had no power in the premises; the attorney-general
was not positive in regard to the extent of
his power in such a case, though he admitted the case
to be an aggravated one; the judges could only recognise
him as a nigger, consequently must govern
their proceedings by legislative acts. Upon the
whole, he found that he was wasting his time, for
while they all talked sympathy, they acted tyranny.<pb n="168"/>
Cold, measured words about niggers, "<emph>contrary to
law</emph>," constitutional rights, inviolable laws, State
sovereignty and secession, the necessary police regulations
to protect a peculiar institution, and their
right to enforce them, everywhere greeted his ears.
There was about as much in it to relieve Manuel, as
there would have been had a little bird perched upon
the prison-wall and warbled its song of love to him
while strongly secured in his cell—more tantalizing
because he could hear the notes, but not see the
songster.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the commendable energy of the
consul, he had the satisfaction of knowing that several
very improbable reports touching his course, and
construing it into an interference with the institution
of slavery, had been widely circulated, and were
creating a feeling against him among a certain class
of "<emph>fire-eating</emph>" secessionists. He was too well aware
of the source from which they originated to awaken
any fears, and instead of daunting his energy they
only increased it, and brought to his aid the valuable
services of the Hon. James L. Petigru, a
gentleman of whom it is said, (notwithstanding his
eminence at the bar,) that had it not been for his
purity of character, his opinions in opposition to the
State would have long since consigned him to a
traitor's exile. The truth was—and much against
Mr. Petigru's popularity in his own State—that he
was a man of sound logic, practical judgment, and
legal discrimination. Thus endowed with the requisite
qualities of a good statesman, and pursuing a
true course to create a conservative influence in the
State, he failed to become popular beyond his legal
sphere. Had he espoused that most popular of all<pb n="169"/>
doctrines in South Carolina—nullification and
secession—and carried abstraction to distraction, James L.
Petigru would have added another "<emph>Roman name</emph>"
to that which has already passed from South Carolina's
field of action.</p>
            <p>The consul did his duty, but effected nothing;
and such was the opposition manifested by the officials
who were interested in the spoils of law, and politicians
who could not see any thing important beyond secession,
that there was no prospect of it. And, as the
last resort, he appealed to the Judiciary through the
"habeas corpus," the result of which we shall show
in a subsequent chapter.</p>

            <p>THE consul had returned to his office rather discomfited
at not being able to relieve Manuel, yet
satisfied that he had placed matters in their proper
light before the public. The Captain reported and
left his manifest at the custom-house, after entering
his protest and making the necessary arrangements
for survey, &amp;c. &amp;c. And Colonel S—— became so
well satisfied of the affectation of <emph>law protectors</emph>, and
that his services in behalf of humanity were like
straws contending against a foaming current, that,
acknowledging his regrets to the Captain, he preferred
to make up in attention what he could not do
for Manuel through the law.</p>
            <pb n="170"/>
            <p>Little George paid his respects to the Janson between
ten and eleven o'clock, duly dressed. "Mr.
Mate, where's your, skipper?" he inquired, with an
air of consequence that put an extra pucker on his
little twisting mouth.</p>
            <p>"Gone to jail, or to see Doctor Jones, I expect, not
giving ye an ill answer," replied the old mate, gruffly.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you don't know who I am, sir. Your
answer's not polite. You must remember, sir, you're
in South Carolina, the sunny city of the South,"
said the little secessionist.</p>
            <p>"I al'a's make my answer to suit myself. I study
hard work and honesty, but never was known to carry
a grammar in my pocket. But, my taut friend, I
should know'd I was in South Carolina if you hadn't
said a word about it, for no other nation under the
sky would a dragged a poor cast-away sailor to prison
because he had the misfortune to have a tawny hide.
It's a ten-to-one, my hearty, if you don't find the
skipper in jail, and all the rest of us, before we leave.
I'm lookin' now to see some body-grabber coming
down with a pair of handcuffs," continued the mate.</p>
            <p>"What! do you mean to insult me again, Mr.
Mate? Explain yourself! I'm not accustomed to
this ironical talk!"</p>
            <p>"Well, it's something like your laws. They dragged
our steward off to jail this morning, without judge
or jury, and with about as much ceremony as a Smithfield
policeman would a pickpocket."</p>
            <p>"What! you don't say. Well, I was afraid of
that. Our officers are mighty quick, but I'd hoped
differently. But, sir, give my compliments to the
Captain. Tell him I'll make the matter all right;
my influence, sir, and my father's—he is one of the<pb n="171"/>
first men in the city—tells mightily here. I have
promised my services to the Captain, and I'll see him
through. Just pledging my word to Grimshaw will
be enough to satisfy the judicial requisites of the
law," said George, switching his little cane on his
trowsers.</p>
            <p>"My good fellow," said the mate, "if you can get
our steward out a limbo, you'll be doing us all a
good turn, and we'll remember you as long as we pull
a brace."</p>
            <p>"You may reckon on me, Mister Mate; and if I
a'n't down before six o'clock, my father will certainly
take the matter in hand; and he and Mazyck belong
to the secession party, and control things just as they
please at Columbia." So saying, George bid the old
mate good morning, and bent his course for the head
of the wharf.</p>
            <p>"There," said the old mate, "it's just what I
thought all along; I knew my presentiment would
come true. I'll wager a crown they treat Manuel
like a dog in that old prison, and don't get him out
until he is mildewed; or perhaps they'll sell him for a
slave a'cos he's got curly black hair and a yellow
skin. Now I'm a hardy sailor, but I've sailed around
the world about three times, and know something of
nature. Now ye may note it as clear as the north
star, prisons in slave countries a'n't fit for dogs. They
may tell about their fine, fat, slick, saucy niggers, but
a slave's a slave—his master's property, a piece of
merchandise, his chattel, or his football—thankful for
what his master may please to give him, and inured
to suffer the want of what he withholds. Yes, he
must have his thinking stopped by law, and his back
lashed at his master's will, if he don't toe the mark<pb n="172"/>
in work. Men's habits and associations form their
feelings and character, and it's just so with them
fellers; they've become so accustomed to looking
upon a nigger as a mere tool of labor—lordin' it over
him, starving him, and lashing him—that they associate
the exercise of the same feelings and actions
with every thing connected with labor, without paying
any respect to a poor white man's feelings," continued
the mate, addressing himself to his second,
as they sat upon the companion, waiting for the
Captain to come on board and give further orders.</p>
            <p>Never were words spoken with more truth. The
negro is reduced to the lowest and worst restrictions,
even by those who are considered wealthy planters
and good masters. We say nothing of those whose
abuse of their negroes by starvation and punishment
forms the theme of complaint among slaveholders
themselves. His food is not only the coarsest that
can, be procured, but inadequate to support the system
for the amount of labor required. Recourse to
other means becomes necessary. This is supplied by
giving the slave his task, which, so far as our observation
extends, is quite sufficient for any common, laborer's
day's-work. This done, his master is served;
and as an act of kindness, (which Sambo is taught to
appreciate as such,) he is allowed to work on his own
little cultivated patch to raise a few things, which
mass'r (in many cases) very condescendingly sells in
the market, and returns those little comforts, which
are so much appreciated by slaves on a plantation—tea,
molasses, coffee, and <emph>tobacco</emph>—and now and then a
little wet of whiskey. This is the allowance of a good
man doing a good week's work, and getting two pounds
of bacon and a peck of corn as his compensation. But,<pb n="173"/>
in grateful consideration, his good master allows him
to work nights and Sundays to maintain himself. In
this way was "<hi>Bob's bale of cotton</hi>" raised, which
that anxious child of popular favor, the editor of the
"Savannah Morning News," so struggled to herald
to the world as something magnificent on the part of
the Southern slave-masters. At best, it was but a
speck. If the many extra hours of toil that poor Bob
had spent, and the hours of night that he had watched
and nursed his plants, were taken into account, there
would be a dark picture connected with "<hi>Bob's bale
of cotton</hi>," which the editor <emph>forgot</emph> to disclose.</p>
            <p>Every form of labor becomes so associated with
servitude, that we may excuse the Southerner for
those feelings which condemn those devoted to mechanical
pursuits as beneath his caste and dignity.
Arrogance and idleness foster extravagance, while his
pride induces him to keep up a style of life which his
means are inadequate to support. This induces him
to subsist his slaves on the coarsest fare, and becoming
hampered, embarrassed, and fretted in his fast-decaying
circumstances, his slaves, one by one, suffer
the penalty of his extravagance, and finally he himself
is reduced to such a condition that he is unable
to do justice to himself or his children any longer;
his slaves are dragged from him, sold to the terrors
of a distant sugar-plantation, and he turned out of
doors a miserable man.</p>
            <p>We see this result every day in South Carolina; we
hear the comments in the broadways and public places,
while the attorney and bailiff's offices and <emph>notices</emph> tell
the sad tale of poverty's wasting struggle.</p>
            <p>George, in passing from the wharf into the bay,
met the Captain, who was shaping his course for the<pb n="174"/>
brig. He immediately ran up to him, and shook his
hands with an appearance of friendship. "Captain,
I'm right sorry to hear about your nigger. I was not
prepared for such a decision on the part of Mr. Grimshaw,
but I'm determined to have him out," said he.</p>
            <p>"Well!" said the Captain, "I'm sorry to say, I find
things very different from what I anticipated. My
steward is imprisoned, for nothing, except that he is a
Portuguese, and everybody insists that he's a nigger.
Everybody talks very fine, yet nobody can do any
thing; and every thing is left to the will of one man."</p>
            <p>"Why, Captain, we've the best system in the world
for doing business; you'd appreciate it after you
understood it! Just come with me, and let me introduce
you to <emph>my</emph> father. If he don't put you right,
I'll stand convicted," said little George.</p>
            <p>Accepting the invitation, they walked back to the
"<emph>old man's</emph>" counting-room. George had given the
Captain such an extended account of his father's business
and estates, that the latter had made up his mind
to be introduced to an "India Palace' counting-room.
Judge of his surprise, then, when George led the way
into an old, dirty-looking counting-room, very small
and dingy, containing two dilapidated high desks,
standing against the wall. They were made of pitch
pine, painted and grained, but so scarred and whittled
as to have the appearance of long use and abuse. In
one corner was an old-fashioned low desk, provided
with an ink-stand, sundry pieces of blotting-paper,
the pigeon-holes filled with loose invoices, letters, and
bills of lading, very promiscuously huddled together;
while hanging suspended on a large nail, driven in the
side, and exposed to view, was an enormous dust-brush.
A venerable-looking subject of some foreign country<pb n="175"/>
stood writing at one desk, a little boy at the other,
and George's veritable "<emph>old man</emph>" at the low desk.
Here and there around the floor were baskets and
papers containing samples of sea-island and upland
cotton. George introduced the Captain to his father
with the suavity of a courtier. He was a grave-looking
man, well dressed, and spoke in a tone that at
once enlisted respect. Unlike George, he was a tall,
well-formed man, with bland, yet marked features,
and very gray hair. He received the Captain in a
cold, yet dignified manner—inquired about his voyage,
and who he had consigned to, and what steps he had
taken to proceed with his business,—all of which the
Captain answered according to the circumstances.</p>
            <p>"What! then you have consigned already, have
you?" said little George, with surprise.</p>
            <p>"Oh yes," returned the Captain, "I have left my
business in the hands of the consul, and shall follow
his directions. It's according to my sailing orders.
But there's so much difficulty, I shouldn't wonder if
I had to leave the port, yet!"</p>
            <p>"Not so, Captain; I'll take care of that!" said
George, giving his father a statement of the Captain's
trouble about Manuel's imprisonment, and begging
that he would bestow his influence in behalf of his
friend the Captain. Although George coupled his
request with a seeming sincerity, it was evident that
he felt somewhat disappointed at the consignment.
The old gentleman looked very wise upon the subject,
lifted his gold-framed spectacles upon his forehead,
gratified his olfactory nerves with a pinch of snuff,
and then said in a cold, measured tone, "Well, if
he's a nigger, I see no alternative,—the circumstances
may give a coloring of severity to the law; but my<pb n="176"/>
opinion has always been, that the construction of the
law was right; and the act being founded upon necessity,
I see no reason why we should meddle with
its prerogative. I think the interference of the consul
unwarrantable, and pressed upon mere technical
grounds. These stories about the bad state of our
jail, and the sufferings of criminals confined in it,
arise, I must think, from the reports of bad prisoners.
I have never been in it. Our people are opposed to
vice, and seldom visit such a place; but the <emph>sheriff</emph> tells
me it is comfortable enough for anybody. If this be
so, and I have no reason to doubt his word, we can
exercise our sympathy and kindness for his shipwrecked
circumstances, and make him as comfortable there
as we could anywhere else. There are many different
opinions, I admit, touching the effect of this law; but
I'm among those who support stringent measures for
better protection. His color can form no excuse,
Captain, so long as there is symptoms of the negro
about him. We might open a wide field for metaphysical
investigation, if we admitted exceptions upon
grades of complexion; for many of our own slaves
are as white ar the brightest woman. Consequently,
when we shut the gates entirely, we save ourselves
boundless perplexity. Nor would it be safe to grant
an issue upon the score of intelligence, for experience
has taught us that the most intelligent '<emph>bright
fellows</emph>' are the worst scamps in creating discontent
among the slaves. I only speak of these things,
Captain, in a general sense. Your man may be very
good, noble, generous, and intelligent; and, more than
all, not inclined to meddle with our peculiar
institution,—but it would be a false principle to make him
an exception, setting an example that would be<pb n="177"/>
entirely incompatible with our greatest interests. So
far as my word will affect the sheriff, and enlist his
better feelings in making him comfortable, I will use
it," said the '<emph>old man</emph>,' again adjusting his specs.</p>
            <p>Little George seemed dumbfounded with mortification,
and the Captain felt as though he would give a
guinea to be on board his brig. It was no use for
him to enter into the extenuating circumstance of
his voyage, or the character of the man, Manuel.
The same cold opinions about the law, and the faith
and importance of South Carolina and her peculiar
institutions, met his ears wherever he went. The
Captain arose, took his hat, and bidding the old gentleman
good morning, again left for his brig.</p>
            <p>"Don't be worried about it—I'll do what I can for
you," said the old man, as the Captain was leaving.
George followed him into the street, and made a great
many apologies for his father's opinions and seeming
indifference, promising to do himself what his father
did not seem inclined to undertake. The Captain
saw no more of him during his stay in Charleston,
and if his influence was exerted in Manuel's behalf,
he did not feel its benefits.</p>
            <p>Business had so occupied the Captain's attention
during the day, that he had no time to visit Manuel
at the jail; and when he returned to the vessel, a
message awaited him from the British consul. One
of the seamen had been detailed to fill Manuel's
place, who, with his dinner all prepared, reminded
the Captain that it was awaiting him. He sat down,
took dinner, and left to answer the consul's call. Arriving
at the office, he found the consul had left for his
hotel, and would not return until four o'clock. As
he passed the post-office, a knot of men stood in front<pb n="178"/>
of it, apparantly in anxious discussion. Feeling that
their conversation might be interesting to him, or have
some connection with his case, he walked slowly back,
and as he approached them, observed that the conversation
had become more excited. The principals
were Mr. Grimshaw, and a factor on the bay, deeply
interested in shipping.</p>
            <p>"A man acting in your capacity," said the factor,
"should never make use of such expressions—never
give encouragement to mob law. It's not only disgraceful
to any city, but ruinous to its interests.
Officials never should set or encourage the example.
Want of order is already in the ascendant, and if the
populace is to be led on to riot by the officials, what
check have we? God save us from the direful
effects!" </p>
            <p>"Well, perhaps I went too far," said Mr. Grimshaw,
"for I think as much of the name of our fair
city as you do. But we ought to teach him that he
can't pursue this open, bold, and daring course, endangering
our institutions, because he's consul for
Great Britain. I would, at all events, treat him as
we did the <emph>Yankee HOAR</emph> from Massachusetts, and
let the invitation be given outside of official character,
to save the name; then, if he did not move off, I'd
go for serving him as they did the Spanish consul, in
New Orleans. These English niggers and Yankee
niggers are fast destroying the peace of Charleston."</p>
            <p>"You would, would you?" said another. "Then
you would incite the fury of an ungovernable mob to
endanger the man's life for carrying out the instructions
of his government."</p>
            <p>"That don't begin to be all that he does, for he's
meddling with every thing, and continually making<pb n="179"/>
remarks about our society," said Grimshaw, evidently
intending to create ill feeling against the consul, and
to make the matter as bad as possible.</p>
            <p>"Now, Mr. Grimshaw," said the factor, "you
know your jail is not fit to put any kind of human
beings into, much less respectable men. It's an old
Revolutionary concern, tumbling down with decay,
swarming with insects and vermin; the rooms are
damp and unhealthy, and without means to ventilate
them; the mildew and horrible stench is enough to
strike disease into the strongest constitution; and
you aggravate men's appetites with food that's both
insufficient and unwholesome, I know, because I visited
a friend who was put in there on 'mesne process.'"</p>
            <p>"There is little confidence to be placed in the
stories of prisoners; they all think they must be
treated like princes, instead of considering that they
are put there for cause, and that a jail was intended
for punishment," interrupted Grimshaw, anxious to
change the subject of conversation, and displaying an
habitual coldness to misfortune which never can see
the gentleman in <emph>a prisoner</emph>.</p>
            <p>"Yes, but you must not measure men by that
standard. Circumstances which bring them there
are as different as their natures. I've known many
good, honest, and respectable, citizens, who once enjoyed
affluence in our community, put in there, month
after month, and year after year, suffering the persecution
of creditors and the effects of bad laws.
Now these men would not all complain if there was
no cause, and they all loved you, as you state. But
tell me, Mr. Grimshaw, would it not be even safer for
our institutions to make a restriction confining them
to the wharf, which could be easily done, and with<pb n="180"/>
but small expense to the city? Niggers on the
wharves could have no communication with them,
because each is occupied in his business, and ours are
too closely watched and driven during working hours.
As soon as those hours end, they are bound to leave,
and the danger ends. Again, those niggers who work
on the wharves are generally good niggers, while, on
the other hand, bad niggers are put into jail; and
during the hours these stewards are allowed the
privilege of the yard, they mix with them without
discrimination or restraint. Their feelings, naturally
excited by imprisonment, find relief in discoursing
upon their wrongs with those of their own color, and
making the contamination greater," said the factor,
who seemed inclined to view the matter in its proper
light.</p>
            <p>"Oh! what sir? That would never do. You mistake
a nigger's feelings entirely. Privileges never
create respect with them. Just make a law to leave
'em upon the wharf, and five hundred policemen
wouldn't keep 'em from spoiling every nigger in
town, just destroying the sovereignty of the law, and
yielding a supreme right that we have always contended
for. It's '<emph>contrary to law</emph>,' and we must
carry out the law," replied Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>"Pshaw! Talk such stuff to me! Just take away
the sixteen hundred or two thousand dollars that you
make by the law; and you'd curse it for a nuisance.
It would become obsolete, and the poor devils of
stewards would do what they pleased; you'd never
trouble your head about them. Now, Grimshaw, be
honest for once; tell us what you would do if circumstances
compelled the Captain to leave that
nigger boy here?"</p>
            <pb n="181"/>
            <p>"Carry out the letter of the law; there's no
alternative. But the Captain swears he's a white
man, and that would give him an opportunity to
prove it."</p>
            <p>"How is he to prove it, Grimshaw? We take away
the power, and then ask him to do what we make impossible.
Then, of course, you would carry out the
letter of the law and sell him for a slave. *   *   *
Well, I should like to see the issue upon a question
of that kind carried out upon an English nigger. It
would be more of a curse upon our slave institution
than every thing else that could be raised," said the
factor.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, you might as well preach abolition at
once, and then the public would know what your sentiments
were, and how to guard against you. I must
bid you good-by." So saying, Mr. Grimshaw twisted
his whip, took a large quid of tobacco, and left the
company to discuss the question among themselves.</p>

            <head type="sub">LITTLE TOMMY AND THE POLICE.</head>
            <p>WE must take the reader back to the old jail, and
continue our scene from where we left little Tommy
spreading the Captain's present before the imprisoned
stewards, whose grateful thanks were showered upon
the head of the bestower. Kindness, be it ever so
small, to a man in prison, is like the golden rays of
the rising sun lighting up the opening day. They
all partook of the refreshments provided for them
with grateful spirits.</p>
            <p>It was near ten o'clock when Daley came to announce
that it was time to close the prison, and all
strangers must withdraw. Tommy had insisted upon
stopping with Manuel during the night, but
Daley,<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>This man Daley was a proverbial drunkard, a tyrant in the
exercise of his "little brief authority," and a notorious ——.
Singular as it may seem, considering his position, he would
quarrel with the men for a glass of whiskey, had given the jailer
more trouble than any other man, and been several times confined
in the cells for his incorrigible vices. If any thing more was
wanting to confirm our note, we could refer to Colonel Condy, the
very gentlemanly United States marshal.</p>
               </note>
in a very rude manner, told him it was against the
rules, and putting his hand to his back, pushed him
out of the cell and secured the bolts. The little fellow
felt his way through the passage and down the stairs
in the dark until he reached the corridor, where the
jailer stood awaiting to let him pass the outer <orig>iron-</orig>
               <pb n="183"/>
gate. "You've made a long stay, my little fellow.
You'll have a heap o' trouble to find the wharf, at
this time o' night. I'd o' let you stopped all night,
but it's strictly against the sheriff's orders," said the
jailer, as, he passed into the street, at the same time
giving him a list of imperfect directions about the
course to proceed.</p>
            <p>The jail is in a distant and obscure part of the city,
surrounded by narrow streets and lanes, imperfectly
laid out and undefined. In leaving the walls of the
prison, he mistook his direction, and the night being
very dark, with a light, drizzling rain, which commenced
while he was in the prison, the whole aspect
of things seemed reversed. After travelling about
for some time, he found himself upon a narrow strip
of land that crossed a basin of water and led to Chisholm's
mill. The different appearance of things here
convinced him of his error. Bewildered, and not
knowing which way to proceed, he approached a cross
road, and sitting down upon a log, wept bitterly. He
soon heard a footstep, and as it approached, his cares
lightened. It proved to be a negro man from the
mill,<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>These mills are worked all night, and the poor negroes,
wishing to follow an example which massa sets on a grand scale, save
that they have an excuse in the fatigue of labor, will delegate
some shrewd one of their number to proceed to a Dutch "corner-shop"
in the suburbs, run the gauntlet of the police, and get a
bottle of whiskey, When interrogated, they are always "going
for a bottle of molasses." They keep a keen watch for the police,
and their cunning modes of eluding their vigilance forms many
amusing anecdotes. They are bound to have a pass from
master, or some white man; but if they can reach the shop in
safety, the Dutchman will always furnish them with one to return.
It not unfrequently happens that the guard-men are much more
ignorant than the slaves. The latter knowing this, will endeavor
to find their station and approach by it, taking with them either
an old pass or a forged one, which the guard-man makes a wonderful
piece of importance about examining and countersigning,
though he can neither read nor write. Thus Sambo passes on to
get his molasses, laughing in his sleeve to think how he "<emph>fool
ignorant buckra</emph>." A change of guard often forms a trap for
Sambo, when he is lugged to the guard-house, kept all night, his
master informed in the morning, and requested to step up and pay
a fine, or Sambo's back catches thirty-nine, thus noting a depression
of value upon the property. Sometimes his master pays the municipal
fine, and administers a domestic castigation less lacerating.</p>
               </note>
bound into the city on the usual errand of <orig>pro-</orig>
               <pb n="184"/>
curing a little of molasses. When he first discovered
Tommy, he started back a few paces, as if in fear; but
on being told by Tommy that he was lost, and wanted
to find his way to the wharves, he approached and
recovering, confidence readily, volunteered to see him
to the corner of Broad street. So, taking him by
the hand, they proceeded together until they reached
the termination of the Causeway, and were about to
enter Tradd street, when suddenly a guard-man sprang
from behind an old shed. The negro, recognising his
white belt and tap-stick, made the best of his time,
and set off at full speed down a narrow lane. The
watchman proceeded close at his heels, springing his
rattle at every step, and pouring out a volley of vile
imprecations. Tommy stood for a few moments, but
soon the cries of the negro and the beating of clubs
broke upon his ear; he became terrified, and ran
at the top of his speed in an opposite direction.
Again he had lost his way, and seemed in a worse
dilemma than before; he was weary and frightened,
and hearing so many stories among the sailors about
selling white children for slaves, and knowing the
imprisonment of Manuel, which he did not <orig>compre-</orig>
               <pb n="185"/>
hend, his feelings were excited to the highest degree.
After running for a few minutes, he stopped to see
if he could recognize his position. The first thing
that caught his eye was the old jail, looming its
sombre walls in the gloomy contrast of night. He
followed the walls until he reached the main gate,
and then, taking an opposite direction from his former
route, proceeded along the street until he came to a
lantern, shedding its feeble light upon the murky
objects at the corner of a narrow lane. Here he
stood for several minutes, not knowing which way to
proceed: the street he was in continued but a few
steps farther, and turn which ever way he would,
darkness and obstacles rose to impede his progress.
At length he turned down the lane, and proceeded
until he came to another junction of streets; taking
one which he thought would lead him in the right
direction, he wandered through it and into a narrow,
circuitous street, full of little, wretched-looking houses.
A light glimmered from one of them, and he saw a
female passing to and fro before the window. He
approached and rapped gently upon the door. Almost
simultaneously the light was extinguished. He stood
for a few minutes, and again rapped louder than
before; all was silent for some minutes. A drenching
shower had commenced, adding to the already
gloomy picture; and the rustling leaves on a tree that
stood near gave an ominous sound to the excited
feelings of the child. He listened at the door with
anxiety and fear, as he heard whispers within; and
as he was about to repeat his rapping, a window on
the right hand was slowly raised. The female who
had been pacing the floor protruded her head with a
caution that bespoke alarm. Her long, black hair<pb n="186"/>
hanging about her shoulders, and her tawny, Indian
countenance, with her ghost-like figure dressed in a
white habiliment, struck him with a sort of terror that
wellnigh made him run.</p>
            <p>"Who is that, at this time of night?" inquired the
woman, in a low voice.</p>
            <p>"It's only me. I'm lost, and can't find my way
to our vessel," said Tommy, in a half-crying tone.</p>
            <p>"Mother," said the woman, shutting the window,
"it's only a little sailor-boy, a stranger, and he's wet
through."</p>
            <p>She immediately unbarred and opened the door,
and invited him to come in. Stepping beyond the
threshold, she closed the door against the storm, and
placing a chair at the fire, told him to sit down and
warm himself. They were mulatto half-breeds, retaining
all the Indian features which that remnant of
the tribe now in Charleston are distinguished by
a family well known in the city, yet under the strictest
surveillance of the police. Every thing around the
little room denoted poverty and neatness. The
withered remnant of an aged Indian mother lay
stretched upon a bed of sickness, and the daughter,
about nineteen years old, had been watching over her,
and administering those comforts, which her condition
required. "Why, mother, it's a'most twelve o'clock.
I don't believe he'll come to-night,<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>She
awaited her <emph>friend</emph>, or rather he whose mistress she had
condescended to be, after passing from several lords. The history
of this female remnant of beautiful Indian girls now left in
Charleston, is a mournful one. The recollection of their noble
sires, when contrasted with their present unhappy associations,
affords a sad subject for reflection.</p>
               </note>
and this little
boy can stop till morning in our room up-stairs," said<pb n="187"/>
she, looking up at an old Connecticut clock that
adorned the mantel-piece.</p>
            <p>"Oh! I could not stay all night. The mate would
be uneasy about me, and might send the crew to look
for me. I'm just as thankful, but I couldn't stop,"
said Tommy.</p>
            <p>"But you never can find the bay on such a night
as this; and I've no pass, or I would show you into
Broad street, and then you could find the way. I
am afraid of the guardmen, and if they caught me
and took me to the station, my friend would abuse
me awfully," said Angeline, for such was her name;
and she laid her hand upon his arm to feel his wet
clothes.</p>
            <p>He now arose from the chair, and putting on his
hat, she followed him to the door and directed him
how to proceed to find Broad street.</p>
            <p>He proceeded according to her directions, and soon
found it. Now, he thought, he was all right; but the
wind had increased to a gale, and having a full sweep
through the street, it was as much as he could do to
resist it. He had scarcely reached half the distance
of the street when it came in such sudden gusts that
he was forced to seek a refuge against its fury in the
recess of a door. He sat down upon a step, and
buttoning his little jacket around him, rested his head
upon his knees, and while waiting for the storm to
abate, fell into a deep sleep. From this situation he
was suddenly aroused by a guardman, who seized him
by the collar, and giving him an unmerciful twitch,
brought, him headlong upon the sidewalk.</p>
            <p>"What are you at here? Ah! another miserable
vagrant, I suppose. We'll take care of such rascals<pb n="188"/>
as you; come with me. We'll larn ye to be round
stealing at this time o' night."</p>
            <p>"No, sir! no, sir! I didn't do nothing"——</p>
            <p>"Shut up! None of your lyin' to a policeman,
you young rascal. I don't want to hear, nor I won't
stand your infernal lies."</p>
            <p>"Oh do, mister, let me tell you all about it, and I
know you won't hurt me. I'm only going to the
vessel, if you'll show me the way," said the little
fellow imploringly.</p>
            <p>"Stop yer noise, ye lying young thief, you. Ye
wouldn't be prowling about at this time o' night if
ye belonged to a vessel. 'Pon me soul, I believe yer
a nigger. Come to the light," said the guardman,
dragging him up to a lamp near by. "Well, you
a'n't a nigger, I reckon, but yer a strolling vagrant,
and that's worse," he continued, after examining his
face very minutely. So, dragging him to the guardhouse
as he would a dog, and thrusting him into a sort
of barrack-room, the captain of the guard and several
officials soon gathered around him to inquire the
difficulty. The officers listened to the guardman's
story, with perfect confidence in every thing he said,
but refused to allow the little fellow to reply in his
own behalf. "I watched him for a long time, saw
him fumbling about people's doors, and then go to
sleep in Mr. T——'s recess. These boys are gettin'
to be the very mischief—most dangerous fellows we
have to deal with," said the policeman.</p>
            <p>"Oh, no! I was only goin' to the brig, and got
turned round. I've been more than two hours trying
to find my way in the storm. I'm sure I a'n't done
no harm. If ye'll only let me tell my story," said
Tommy.</p>
            <pb n="189"/>
            <p>"Shut up! We want no stories till morning. The
mayor will settle your hash to-morrow; and if you
belong to a ship, you can. tell him all about it; but
you'll have the costs to pay anyhow. Just lay down
upon that bench, and you can sleep there till morning;
that's better than loafing about the streets," said the
captain of the guard, a large, portly-looking man, as
he pointed Tommy to a long bench similar to those
used in barrack-rooms.</p>
            <p>The little fellow saw it was no use to attempt a
hearing, and going quietly to the bench, he pulled
off his man-a-war hat, and laying it upon a chair,
stretched himself out upon it, putting his little hands
under his head to ease it from the hard boards.</p>
            <p>But he was not destined to sleep long in this position,
for a loud, groaning noise at the door, broke
upon their ears though the pelting fury of the storm,
like one in agonizing distress.</p>
            <p>"Heavens! what is that!" said the captain of the
guard, suddenly starting from his seat, and running
for the door, followed by the whole posse. The
groans grew louder and more death-like in their sound,
accompanied by strange voices, giving utterance to
horrible imprecations, and a dragging upon the floor.
The large door opened, and what a sight presented
itself! Three huge monsters, with side-arms on,
dragged in the poor negro who proffered to show
Tommy into Broad street. His clothes were nearly
torn from his back, besmeared with mud, from head to
foot, and his face cut and mangled in the most shocking
manner. His head, neck, and shoulders, were
covered with a gore of blood, and still it kept oozing
from his mouth and the cuts on his head. They
dragged him in as if he was a dying dog that had<pb n="190"/>
been beaten with a club, and threw him into a corner,
upon the floor, with just about as much unconcern.</p>
            <p>"Oh! massa! massa! kill me, massa, den 'em stop
sufferin'!" said the poor fellow, in a painful murmur,
raising his shackled hands to his head, and grasping
the heavy chain that secured his neck, in the agony
of pain.</p>
            <p>"What has he done?" inquired the officer.</p>
            <p>"Resisted the guard, and ran when we told him to
stop!" responded a trio of voices. "Yes, and attempted
to get into a house. Ah! you vagabond
you; that's the way we serve niggers like you!—Attempt
to run again, will you? I'll knock your
infernal daylights out, you nigger you," said one of
the party.</p>
            <p>"It does seem tome that you might have taken
him, and brought him up with less severity," said the
officer.</p>
            <p>"What else could we do, sure? Didn't we catch
him prowling about with a white fellow, and he runn'd
till we couldn't get him. Indeed it was nothing good
they were after, and it's the like o' them that bees
doing all the mischief beyant the city."</p>
            <p>"An' 'imself, too, struck Muldown two pokes, 'efore
he lave de hancuffs be pat upon him, at all!" said another
of the guardmen; and then turning around,
caught a glimpse of poor little Tommy, who had been
standing up near a desk, during the scene, nearly
"frightened out of his wits."</p>
            <p>"By the pipers,—what! and is't here ye are?
The same that was with himself beyant! Come here,
you spalpeen you. Wasn't ye the same what runn'd
whin we bees spaken to that nigger?" said the same<pb n="191"/>
guardman, taking hold of Tommy's arm, and drawing
him nearer the light.</p>
            <p>"Yes, he was coming along with me, to show
me"——</p>
            <p>"Stop!—you know you are going to lie already.
Better lock 'em both up for the night, and let them
be sent up in the morning," said another.</p>
            <p>"Then you won't let me speak for myself——"</p>
            <p>"Hush, sir!" interrupted the officer; "you can
tell your story in the morning! but take care you are
not a vagrant. If it's proved that you were with that
nigger at the improper hour, you'll get your back
scarred. Come, you have owned it, and I must lock
you up."</p>
            <p>Without attempting to wash the blood off the negro,
or dress his wounds, they unlocked the handcuffs, and
loosened the chain from his neck, handling him with
less feeling than they would a dumb brute. Relieved
of his chains, they ordered him to get up.</p>
            <p>The poor creature looked up imploringly, as if to
beg them to spare his life, for he was too weak to
speak. He held up his hands, drenched with blood,
while beneath his head was a pool of gore that had
streamed from his mounds. "None of your infernal
humbuggery—you could run fast enough. Just get
up, and be spry about it, or I'll help you with the
cowhide," said the officer, calling to one of the
guardmen to bring it to him. He now made an
effort, and had got upon his knees, when the guardman
that seemed foremost in his brutality fetched him a
kick with his heavy boots in the side, that again felled
him to the ground with a deep groan.</p>
            <p>"Ot-tut! that will not do. You mus'n't kill the
nigger; his master will come for him in the morning,"<pb n="192"/>
said the officer, stooping down and taking hold of his
arm with his left hand, while holding a cowhide in
his right. "Come, my boy, you must get up and go
into the lock-up," he continued.</p>
            <p>"Massa! oh, good massa, do—don't! I's most dead
now, wha'for ye no lef me whare a be?" said he in
a whining manner; and making a second attempt, fell
back upon the floor, at which two of them seized him
by the shoulders, and dragging him into a long, dark,
cell-like room, threw him violently upon the floor.
Then returning to the room, the officer took Tommy
by the arm, and marching him into the same room,
shut the door to smother his cries. The little fellow
was so frightened, that he burst into an excitement
of tears. The room was dark, and as gloomy as a
cavern. He could neither lie down, sleep, nor console
himself. He thought of Manuel, only to envy his
lot, and would gladly have shared his imprisonment,
to be relieved from such a horrible situation. Morning
was to bring, perhaps, worse terrors. He thought
of the happy scenes of his rustic home in Dunakade,
and his poor parents, but nothing could relieve the
anguish of his feelings. And then, how could he get
word to his Captain? If they were so cruel to him
now, he could not expect them to be less so in the
morning. In this manner, he sat down upon the
floor with the poor negro, and, if he could do nothing
more, sympathized with his feelings. The poor negro
murmured and groaned in a manner that would have
enlisted the feelings of a Patagonian; and in this
way he continued until about three o'clock in the
morning, when his moaning became so loud and
pitiful, that the officer of the guard came to the door
with an attendant, and unbolting it, entered with a<pb n="193"/>
lantern in his hand. He held the light toward his
face, and inquired what he was making such a noise
about? "Oh! good massa, good massa, do send for
docta; ma head got a pile o' cuts on him," said he,
putting his hand to his head. The officer passed the
lantern to his attendant, and after putting a pair of
gloves on his hands, began to feel his head, turn aside
his torn clothes, and wipe the dirt from the places where
the blood seemed to be clotted. "Good gracious! I
didn't conjecture that you were cut so bad. Here,
my good fellow, (addressing himself to Tommy,) hold
the lantern. Michael, go get a pail of water, and
some cloths," said he, very suddenly becoming awakened
to the real condition of the man, after he had
exhibited a coldness that bordered on brutality.</p>
            <p>Water and cloths were soon brought. The attendant,
Michael, commenced to strip his clothes off, but
the poor fellow was so sore that he screeched, in the
greatest agony, every time he attempted to touch
him. "Be easy," said the officer, "he's hurt pretty
badly. He must a' been mighty refractory, or they'd
never beaten him in this manner," he continued, opening
a roll of adhesive plaster, and cutting it into strips.
After washing, him with water and whiskey, they
dressed his wounds with the plaster, and bound his
head with an old silk handkerchief which they found
in his pocket, after which they left the light burning
and retired.</p>
            <p>After they retired, Tommy inquired of the negro
how they came to keep him so long, before they
brought him to the guard-house? It proved, that as
soon as they came up with him, the first one knocked
him down with a club; and they all at once commenced
beating him with their bludgeons, and continued until<pb n="194"/>
they had satisfied their mad fury. And while he lay
groaning in the streets, they left one of their number
in charge, while the others proceeded to get handcuffs
and chains, in which they bound him, and dragged
him, as it were, the distance of four squares to the
guard-house. What a sublime picture for the meditations
of a people who boast of their bravery and
generosity!</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE NEXT MORNING, AND THE MAYOR'S VERDICT.</head>
            <p>SHORTLY after daylight, Tommy fell into a dozing
sleep, from which he was awakened by the mustering
of the prisoners who had been brought up during the
night, and were to appear before the mayor at nine
o'clock. A few minutes before eight o'clock, an
officer opened the cell-door, and they were ordered
to march out into a long room. In this room they
found all the prisoners gathered. There were three
blacks and five whites, who had been arrested on
different charges; and as the mayor's court was
merely a tribunal of commitment—not judgment—if
the charges upon which the prisoners were brought
up were sustained—which they generally were, because
the policeman who made the arrest was the important
witness, they were committed to await the tardy process
of the law.</p>
            <p>Considerable uneasiness had been felt on board of
the Janson for Tommy, and the Captain suggested
that he might have got astray among the dark lanes<pb n="195"/>
of the city, and that the mate had better send some
of the crew to look for him. The mate, better acquainted
with Tommy's feelings and attachment for
Manuel than he was with the rules of the prison and
Mr. Grimshaw's arbitrary orders, assured the Captain
that such a course would be entirely unnecessary, for
he knew when he left that he would stop all night
with Manuel. This quieted the Captain's apprehensions,
and he said no more about it until he sat down
to breakfast. "I miss Tommy amazingly," said the
Captain. "If he stopped all night, he should be here
by this time. I think some one had better be sent
to the jail to inquire for him." Just as he arose from
the table, one of the crew announced at the companion
that a person on deck wished to see the Captain. On
going up, he found a policeman, who informed him
that a little boy had been arrested as a vagrant in the
street, last night, and when brought before the mayor a
few minutes ago, stated that he belonged to his vessel,
and the mayor had despatched him to notify the
master. "Circumstances are suspicious; he was
seen in company with a negro of very bad habits;
but if you can identify the boy, you had better come
quick, or he'll be sent to jail, and you'll have some
trouble to get him out," said the messenger, giving
the Captain a description of the boy.</p>
            <p>"Oh yes!" said the Captain, "that's my Tommy.
I verily believe they'll have us all in jail before we
get away from the port." Numerous appointments
engrossed his time, and he had promised to meet the
consul at an early hour that morning. Notwithstanding
this, he gave a few orders to the mate about
getting the hatches ready and receiving the port-wardens,
and then immediately repaired to the <orig>all-</orig>
               <pb n="196"/>
important guard-house. He was just in time to
receive the mortifying intelligence that the mayor's
court had concluded its sitting, and to see little
Tommy, with a pair of handcuffs on his hand, in the
act of being committed to jail by a Dutch constable.
He stopped the constable, and being told that his
honor was yet in the room, put a couple of dollars
into his hand to await his intercession. Another
fortunate circumstance favored him; just as he stopped
the constable, he saw his friend, Colonel S——,
approaching. The colonel saw there was trouble,
and with his usual, characteristic kindness, hastened
up and volunteered his services.</p>
            <p>We must now return to the arraignment, as it proceeded
after the messenger had been despatched.</p>
            <p>The negro confined with Tommy presented a
wretched picture when brought into the light room
among the other prisoners. His head was so swollen
that no trace of feature was left in his face. Cuts
and gashes were marked with plaster all over his
neck and face; his head tied up with an old red
handkerchief; his eyes, what could be seen of them,
more like balls of blood than organs of sight; while
the whiskey and water with which his head had been
washed, had mixed with the blood upon his clothes,
and only served to make its appearance more disgusting.
Altogether, a more pitiful object never was
presented to human sight.</p>
            <p>Some minutes before the clock struck nine, an
intelligent-looking gentleman, very well dressed, and
portly in his appearance, entered the room. He was
evidently kindly disposed, but one of those men whose
feelings prompt them to get through business with
despatch, rather than inquire into the circumstances<pb n="197"/>
of aggravated cases. He held a consultation with
the officer for some minutes with reference to the
prisoners. After which he mounted a little tribune,
and addressing a few words to the white prisoners, (a
person who acted the part of clerk announced court
by rapping upon a desk with a little mallet,) inquired
whether the officers had notified the owners of the
negroes. Being informed that they had, he proceeded
with the negroes first. One, by some good fortune,
was taken away by his master, who paid the usual
fee to swell the city treasury; another was sentenced
to receive twenty paddles on the frame at the workhouse;
and the third, the man we have described,
being brought forward, weak with the loss of blood,
leaned his hand upon the back of a chair. "Stand
up straight!" said the officer, in a commanding tone.</p>
            <p>"Now, my boy, this is twice you have been before
this court. Your master has left you to the mercy
of the law, and given strict orders to the police in
the event that you were caught a third time. Your
crime is worse now, for you were caught in company
with that white boy—probably on some errand of
villany, prowling about the streets after <emph>drum-beat</emph>.
I shall, in consideration of the facts here stated by
the police, whose evidence I am bound to recognise,
sentence you to nineteen paddles on the frame, and
to be committed to jail, in accordance with your
master's orders, there to await his further directions.</p>
            <p>"Arraign the white prisoners according to the roll,
Mr. ——. Have you sent a message to the Captain
about that boy?" inquired the mayor.</p>
            <p>"No, yer honor; but I will send at once," said the
officer, stepping into the passage and calling an attendant.</p>
            <pb n="198"/>
            <p>The little fellow was arraigned first. He stood up
before the mayor while the ruffianly policeman who
arrested him preferred the charges and swore to them,
adding as much to give coloring as possible. "Now,
my man, let me hear what you have got to say for yourself.
I have sent for your captain," said the mayor,
looking as if he really felt pity for the little fellow.</p>
            <p>He commenced to tell his simple story, but soon
became so convulsed with tears that he could proceed
no further. "I only went to the jail to see Manuel,
the steward, and I got lost, and begged the black
man to show me the way"—— said he, sobbing.</p>
            <p>"Well, I have heard enough," said the mayor, interrupting
him. "You could not have been at the
jail at that time o' night—impossible. It was after
hours—contrary to rules—and only makes the matter
worse for yourself. You can stand aside, and if the
Captain comes before court is through, we will see
further; if not, you must be committed as a vagrant.
I'm afraid of you young strollers."</p>
            <p>The officer of the guard, as if the poor boy's feelings
were not already sufficiently harassed, took him
by the arm, and pushing him into a corner, said,
"There, you young scamp, sit down. You'll get
your deserts when you get to the jail."</p>
            <p>He sat down, but could not restrain his feelings.
The presence of the Captain was his only hope. He
saw the prisoners arraigned one by one, and join him
as they were ordered for committal. He was handcuffed
like the rest, and delivered to the constable.
The reader can imagine the smile of gladness that
welcomed the Captain's timely appearance. The
latter's exhibition of feeling, and the simple exclamation
of the child's joy, formed a striking picture of<pb n="199"/>
that fondness which a loving child manifests when
meeting its parents after a long absence.</p>
            <p>"Take the irons off that child," said the colonel to
the constable. "A man like you should not put such
symbols of ignominy upon a youth like that."</p>
            <p>"I would do any thing to oblige you, colonel; but
I cannot without orders from the mayor," returned
the man, very civilly.</p>
            <p>"I'll see that you do, very quick," rejoined the
colonel, impatiently; and taking the little fellow by
the arm in a compassionate manner, led him back
into the presence of the mayor, followed by the
Captain.</p>
            <p>"I want to know what you are committing this lad
for," said the colonel, setting his hat upon the table,
while his face flushed with indignation.</p>
            <p>"Vagrancy, and caught prowling about the streets
with a negro at midnight. That is the charge, colonel,"
replied the mayor, with particular condescension
and suavity.</p>
            <p>"Was there any proof adduced to substantiate that
fact?"</p>
            <p>"None but the policeman's; you know we are bound
to take that as prima facie."</p>
            <p>"Then it was entirely ex parte. But you know
the character of these policemen, and the many
aggravated circumstances that have arisen from their
false testimony. I wish to cast no disrespect, your
honor; but really they will swear to any thing for
a fee, while their unscrupulous bribery has become
so glaring, that it is a disgrace to our police system.
Have you heard the boy's story?" said the
colonel.</p>
            <p>"Well, he began to tell a crooked story, so full<pb n="200"/>
of admissions, and then made such a blubbering about
it, that I couldn't make head or tail of it."</p>
            <p>"Well, here is the Captain of his vessel, a friend
of mine, whom I esteem a gentleman—for all captains
ought to be gentlemen, not excepting Georgia captains
and majors," said the colonel, jocosely, turning round
and introducing the Captain to his honor. "Now,
your honor, you will indulge me by listening to the
little fellow's story, which will be corroborated in its
material points by the statements of the Captain,
which, I trust, will be sufficient; if not, we shall recur
to the jailer."</p>
            <p>"It will be sufficient. I am only sorry there has
been so much trouble about it," said the mayor.</p>
            <p>The boy now commenced to tell his story, which
the mayor listened to with all learned attention. No
sooner had Tommy finished, and the Captain arose to
confirm his statements, than the mayor declared himself
satisfied, apologized for the trouble it had caused,
and discharged the boy upon paying the costs, the
amount of which the colonel took from his pocket and
threw upon the table. Thus was Tommy's joy complete;
not so the poor negro whose ill luck he shared.
This high-sounding mayor's court was like Cæsar's
court, with the exceptions in Cæsar's favor.</p>

            <head type="sub">EMEUTE AMONG THE STEWARDS.</head>
            <p>SEVERAL days had passed ere we again introduce
the reader to the cell of the imprisoned stewards.
The captain of the Janson had been assured by Mr.
Grimshaw that every thing was comfortable at the
jail, and Manuel would be well cared for. Confiding
in this, the activity of the consul to bring the matter
before the proper authorities—and the manner in
which his own time was engrossed with his business—left
him no opportunity to visit Manuel at the jail.
Tommy and one of the sailors had carried him his
hammock, and a few things from the ship's stores;
and with this exception, they had but little to eat for
several days. Copeland had but a few days more to
remain, and, together with those who were with him,
had exhausted their means, in providing from day to
day, during their imprisonment. The poor woman
who did their washing, a generous-hearted mulatto,
had brought them many things, for which she asked
no compensation. Her name was <hi>Jane Bee</hi>, and
when the rules of the jail made every man his own
<emph>washerwoman</emph>, she frequently washed for those who
had nothing to pay her. But her means were small,
and she worked hard for a small pittance, and had
nothing to bring them for several days. They were
forced to take the allowance of bread, but could not
muster resolution to eat the sickly meat.</p>
            <p>Those who had suffered from it before, took it as a<pb n="202"/>
natural consequence, looking to the time of their
release, as if it was to bring a happy change in their
lives. But Manuel felt that it was an unprecedented
outrage upon his feelings, and was determined to remonstrate
against it. He knocked loudly at the
door, and some of the prisoners hearing it, reported
to the jailer, who sent Daley to answer it. As soon
as the door was opened, he rushed past, and succeeded
in gaining the iron door that opened into the
vestibule, where he could converse with the Jailer,
through the grating, before Daley could stop him.</p>
            <p>The jailer seeing him at the grating, anticipated
his complaint. "Well, Pereira,—what's the matter
up-stairs?" said he.</p>
            <p>"For God's sake, jailer, what am I put in here
for—to starve? We cannot eat the meat you send
us, and we have had little else than bread and water
for three days. Do give us something to eat, and
charge it to consul, or Captain, an' I'll pay it from
my wages when I get out, if I ever do," said he.</p>
            <p>"My dear fellow!" said the jailer, "no one knows
your case better than I do; but I am poor, and the
restrictions which I am under allow me no privileges.
You had all better take your meat in the morning—if
you won't take soup—and try to cook it, or get
Jane to do it for you. I will give you some coffee
and bread from my own table, to-night, and you
better say as little about it as possible, for if Grimshaw
hears it, he may lock you up."</p>
            <p>"Do, I shall be very thankful, for we are really
suffering from hunger, in our cell, and I pay you
when I get money from Captain," said Manuel, manifesting
his thankfulness at the jailer's kindness.</p>
            <p>"I will send it up in a few minutes, but you<pb n="203"/>
needn't trouble yourself about pay—I wouldn't
accept it!" said the jailer; and as good as his word,
he sent them up a nice bowl of coffee for each, and
some bread, butter, and cheese. They partook of
the humble fare, with many thanks to the donor.
Having despatched it, they seated themselves upon the
floor, around the faint glimmer of a tin lamp, while
Copeland read the twentieth and twenty-first chapters
of the Acts of the Apostles. Copeland was a pious
negro, and his behaviour during his imprisonment enlisted
the respect of every one in jail. Singular as the
taste may seem, he had his corner in the cell decorated
with little framed prints. Among them we noticed
one of the crucifixion, and another of the Madonna.
After reading the chapters, they retired to their
hard beds. About nine o'clock the next morning,
Daley came to the door with a piece of neck meat,
so tainted and bloody that its smell and looks more
than satisfied the stomach.</p>
            <p>"Here it is, boys," said he; "yer four pound,
but ye's better take soup, cos ye'll niver cook that
bone, anyhow."</p>
            <p>"Do you think we're like dogs, to eat such filth
as that? No! I'd rather starve!" said Manuel.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, an' ye'll larn to ate any thing win ye'd be
here a month. But be dad, if ye don't watch number
one about here, ye's won't get much nohow," replied
Daley, dropping the bloody neck upon the floor, and
walking out.</p>
            <p>"Better take it," said Copeland. "There's no
choice, and hunger don't stand for dainties, especially
in this jail, where everybody is famished for punishment.
If we don't eat it, we can give it to some of
the poor prisoners up-stairs."</p>
            <pb n="204"/>
            <p>"While I have good ship-owners, and a good Captain,
I never will eat such stuff as that; oh! no,"
returned Manuel.</p>
            <p>The meat was laid in a corner for the benefit of the
flies; and when dinner time arrived, the same hard
extreme arrived with it—bread and water. And nobody
seemed to have any anxieties on their behalf;
for two of them had written notes to their Captains, on
the day previous, but they remained in the office for
want of a messenger to carry them. Fortunately,
Jane called upon them in the afternoon, and brought
a nice dish of rice and another of homony.</p>
            <p>We will here insert a letter we received from a very
worthy friend, who, though he had done much for
the Charleston people, and been repaid in persecutions,
was thrown into jail for a paltry debt by a
ruthless creditor. Cleared by a jury of twelve men, he
was held in confinement through the wretched imperfection
of South Carolina law, to await nearly twelve
months for the sitting of the "Appeal Court," more
to appease the vindictiveness of his enemies than to
satisfy justice, for it was well understood that he
did not owe the debt. His letter speaks for itself.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR FRIEND,—I could not account for your
absence during the last few days, until this morning,
when Mr. F***** called upon me for a few moments,
and from him I learnt that you had been quite unwell.
If you are about to-morrow, do call upon me; for a
more dreary place, or one where less regard is paid
to the calls of humanity, cannot be found among the
nations of the earth.</p>
                     <pb n="205"/>
                     <p>Such is the ordinary condition of suffering within
this establishment, that men, and even women, are
forced to all kinds of extremes to sustain life; and,
to speak what experience has taught me, crime is
more increased than reduced by this wretched system.
There seems to be little distinction among the prisoners,
and no means to observe it, except in what is
called <emph>Mount Rascal</emph> on the third story. Pilfering is
so common, that you cannot leave your room without
locking your door. The jailer is a good, kind-hearted
old man, very often giving from his own table to
relieve the wants of debtors, many of whom repay
him with ingratitude. I have suffered many privations
from shipwreck and cold, but never until I came
to South Carolina was I compelled to endure imprisonment
and subsist several days upon bread and
water.</p>
                     <p>Talk about chivalry and hospitality! How many
men could join with me and ask, "Where is it?"
But why should I demur, when I see those abroad
who have been driven from this State to seek bread;
when I hear the many voices without tell of struggling
to live, for want of system in mechanical employment,
and when I look upon several within these
sombre walls who are even worse than me. Here is
a physician, with a wife and large family, committed
for a debt which he was unable to pay. His father's
name stands among the foremost of the State—a
General of distinction, who offered his life for her
in time of war, and whose name honors her triumphs,
and has since graced the councils of
state.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                           <p>General Hammond,
whose name occupies such a conspicuous
place in the military history of South Carolina.</p>
                        </note>
The<pb n="206"/>
father's enthusiasm for his country's cause led him to
sacrifice his all, and by it he entailed misfortune upon
his descendants. When I consider the case of Shannon,
whose eleven years and seven months' imprisonment
for debt, as it was called, but which eventually
proved to be a question turning upon technicalities
of law, gave him, body and soul, to the vindictiveness
of a persecutor, whose unrelenting malignity was kept
up during that long space of time. It was merely a
breach of limitation between merchants, the rights of
which should be governed by commercial custom.
Shannon had, amassed about twenty thousand dollars
by hard industry; his health was waning, and he
resolved to retire with it to his native county. The
gem proved too glaring for the lynx eye of a "true
Carolinian," who persuaded him to invest his money
in cotton. Moved by flattering inducements, he authorized
a factor to purchase for him upon certain
restrictions, which, unfortunately for himself, were
not drawn up with regard to legal enforcement—one
of those singular instruments between a merchant
and an inexperienced man which a professional quibbler
can take advantage of. Cotton was at the <emph>tip-top</emph>,
and very soon Shannon was presented with an
account of purchase, and draft so far beyond his
limits, that he demurred, and rejected the purchase
entirely; but some plot should be laid to entrap him.
The factor undertook the force game, notified him
that the cotton was held subject to his order, and
protested the draft for the appearance of straightforwardness.
Cotton shortly fell to the other extreme,
the lot was "shoved up" for sale on Shannon's
account, Shannon was sued for the balance, held to bail,
and in default committed to prison. His confinement<pb n="207"/>
and endurance of it would form a strange chapter in
the history of imprisonment for debt. Carrying his
money with him, he closed the door of his cell, and
neither went out nor would allow any one but the
priest to enter for more than three years; and for
eleven years and seven months he paced the room
upon a diagonal line from corner to corner, until he
wore the first flooring, of two-and-a-quarter-inch pine,
entirely through.</p>
                     <p>I might go on and tell of many others, whose
poverty was well known, and yet suffered years of
imprisonment for debt; but I find I have digressed.
I must relate an amusing affair which took place
this morning between Manuel Pereira, the steward of
the English brig Janson, which put into this port in
distress, and the jailer. He is the man about whom
so much talk and little feeling has been enlisted—a
fine, well-made, generous-hearted Portuguese. He
is olive-complexioned—as light as many of the
Carolinians—intelligent and obliging, and evidently unaccustomed
to such treatment as he receives here.</p>
                     <p>Manuel appeared before the jailer's office this
morning with two junks of disgusting-looking meat, the
neck-bones, tainted and bloody, in each hand. His
Portuguese ire was up. "Mister Poulnot, what you
call dis? In South Carolina you feed man on him,
ah? In my country, ah yes! we feed him to dog.
What you call him? May-be somethin' what me no
know him. In South Carolina, prison sailor when he
shipwreck, starve him on nosin', den tell him eat this,
ah! I sails 'round ze world, but never savage man
gives me like zat to eat! No, I starve 'fore I eat him,
be gar! Zar, you take him," said he, throwing the
pieces of meat upon the floor in disdain.</p>
                     <pb n="208"/>
                     <p>"Meat! Yes, it's what's sent here for us. You
mustn't grumble at me; enter your complaints to the
sheriff, when he comes," said the jailer, with an expression
of mortification on his countenance.</p>
                     <p>"Meat, ah! You call dat meat in South Carolina?
I call him bull-neck, not fit for dog in my country.
I see, when Capitan come, vat he do," said Manuel,
turning about and going to his room in a great excitement.</p>
                     <p>"You'd better be careful how you talk, or you may
get locked up when the sheriff comes."</p>
                     <p>It seems that the Captain had received a note from
him, addressed by one of the white prisoners on the
same floor, and reached the jail just as Manuel had
ascended the stairs. He rang the bell and requested
to see Manuel.</p>
                     <p>"Manuel Pereira?" inquired the jailer.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," said the Captain, "he is my steward."</p>
                     <p>He heard the Captain's voice, and immediately returned
to the lobby. The tears ran down his cheeks
as soon as he saw his old protector. "Well, Manuel,
I am glad to see you, but sorry that it is in imprisonment.
Tell me what is the matter. Don't they use
you well here?" inquired the Captain.</p>
                     <p>Stepping within the office door, he caught up the
pieces of meat, and bringing them out in his hands,
held them up. "There, Capitan, that no fit for man,
is it?" said he. "Law send me prison, but law no
give not'ing to eat. What I do dat people treat me
so? Ah, Capitan, bull neck, by gar, yes—bull born
in South Carolina, wid two neck. Ils sont réduits
à l'extrémité," said he, concluding with broken
French.</p>
                     <pb n="209"/>
                     <p>"That cannot be; it's against the law to kill bulls
in South Carolina," interrupted the jailer jocosely.</p>
                     <p>"Must be. I swear he bull-neck, 'cas he cum
every day just like him. Bull born wid one neck no
cum so many. What I get for breakfast, Capitan,
ah?—piece bad bread. What I get for dinner,
ah?—bull-neck. Yes, what I get for supper, too?—piece
bread and bucket o' water. May-be he bad, may be
he good, just so he come. You think I live on dat,
Capitan?" said he, in reply to the Captain's questions.</p>
                     <p>The Captain felt incensed at such treatment,
and excused himself for not calling before; yet he
could not suppress a smile that stole upon his countenance
in consequence of Manuel's quaint earnestness.</p>
                     <p>"That is certainly strange fare for a human being;
but the supper seems rather a comical one. Did you
drink the bucket of water, Manuel?" inquired the
Captain, retaining a sober face.</p>
                     <p>"Capitan, you know me too well for dat. I not
ask 'em nozin' what he no get, but I want my coffee
for suppe'. I no eat him like zat," throwing the
putrid meat upon the floor again.</p>
                     <p>"Hi, hi! That won't do in this jail. You're
dirtying up all my floor," said the jailer, calling a
negro boy and ordering him to carry the bull-necks,
as Manuel called them, into the kitchen.</p>
                     <p>"You call him dirt, ah, Miser Jailer? Capitan,
just come my room; I shown him," said Manuel,
leading the way up-stairs, and the Captain followed.
A sight at the cell was enough, while the sickly
stench forbid him to enter beyond the threshold. He
promised Manuel that he would provide for him in
future, and turning about suddenly, retreated into
the lower lobby.</p>
                     <pb n="210"/>
                     <p>"Jailer, what does all this mean? Do you allow
men to starve in a land of plenty, and to suffer in a
cell like that?" asked the Captain in a peremptory
tone.</p>
                     <p>"I feel for the men, but you must enter your complaints
to the sheriff—the ration of the jail is entirely
in his hands."</p>
                     <p>"But have you no voice in it, by which you can
alleviate their situation?"</p>
                     <p>"Not the least! My duty is to keep every thing—every
thing to rights, as far as people are committed.
You will find the sheriff in his office, any time between
this and two o'clock," said the jailer. And
the Captain left as suddenly as he came.</p>
                     <p>You will think I have written you an essay, instead
of a letter inviting you to come and see me. Accept
it for its intention, and excuse the circumstances.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE CAPTAIN'S INTERVIEW WITH MR. GRIMSHAW.</head>
            <p>THE appearance of things at the jail was forlorn
in the extreme. The Captain knew the integrity of
Manuel, and not only believed his statement, but
saw the positive proofs to confirm them. He repaired
to the sheriff's office, and inquiring for that
functionary, was pointed to Mr. Grimshaw, who sat
in his large chair, with his feet upon the table, puffing
the fumes of a very fine-flavored Havana, as unconcerned
as if he was lord in sovereignty over every
thing about the city. "I am captain of the Janson,
and have called to inquire about my steward?" said
the Captain.</p>
            <p>"Ah! yes,—you have a <emph>nigger fellow</emph> in jail. Oh!
by-the-by, that's the one there was so much fuss
about, isn't it?" said Mr. Grimshaw, looking up.</p>
            <p>"It is an imperative duty on me to seek the comfort
of my officers and crew," said the Captain. "I
received a note from my steward, this morning,—here
it is, (handing him the note,) you can read it. He
requested me to call upon him at the jail, where I
lost no time in going, and found what he stated there
to be too true. How is it! From the great liberality
of tone which everywhere met my ears when I first
arrived, I was led to believe that he would be made
comfortable; and that the mere confinement was the
only feature of the law that was a grievance. Now I
find that to be the only tolerable part of it. When<pb n="212"/>
a man has committed no crime, and is imprisoned to
satisfy a caprice of public feeling, it should be accompanied
with the most favoring attendants. To
couple it with the most disgraceful abuses, as are
shown here, makes it exceedingly repugnant. If we
pay for confining these men, and for their living
while they are confined, in God's name let us get
what we pay for!"</p>
            <p>The reader will observe that Mr. Grimshaw was a
man of coarse manners and vulgar mind, with all
their traces preserved on the outer man. He looked
up at the Captain with a presumptuous frown, and
then said, "Why, Mr. Captain, how you talk! But
that kind o' talk won't do here in South Carolina.
That nigger o' yourn gives us a mighty site of trouble,
Captain. He doesn't seem to understand that he
must be contented in jail, and live as the other prisoners
do. He gets what the law requires, and if he
gives us any further trouble, we shall lock him up in
the third story."</p>
            <p>"You cannot expect him to be contented, when
you furnish the means of discontent. But I did not
come here to argue with you, nor to ask any thing as
a favour, but as a right. My steward has been left to
suffer! Am I to pay for what he does not get? Or
am I to pay you for the pretence, and still be compelled
to supply him on account of the owners? You
must excuse my feelings, for I have had enough to
provoke them!" returned the Captain.</p>
            <p>"That business is entirely my own! He gets
what the State allows, and I provide. Your steward
never wrote that note; it was dictated by some of
them miserable white prisoners. I can hear no complaints
upon such cases as them. If I were to listen<pb n="213"/>
to all these nonsensical complaints, it would waste all
my time. I wish the devil had all the nigger
stewards and their complaints; the jail's in a fuss
with them all the time. I can hear nothing further,
sir—nothing further!" said Grimshaw emphatically,
interrupting the Captain as he attempted to speak;
at which the Captain became so deeply incensed, that
he relieved his feelings in that sort of plain English
which a Scotchman can best bestow in telling a man
what he thinks of his character.</p>
            <p>"You must remember, sir, you are in the office of
the sheriff of the county—parish, I mean,—and I am,
sir, entitled to proper respect. Begone!—avaunt!
you have no right to come here and traduce my character
in that way. You musn't take me for a parish
beadle," said Grimshaw, contorting the unmeaning
features of his visage, and letting fly a stream of tobacco
juice in his excitement.</p>
            <p>"If you have no laws to give me justice, you
have my opinion of your wrongs," returned the Captain,
and taking his hat, left the office with the intention
of returning to the jail. On reflection, he
concluded to call upon Colonel S——, which he did,
and finding him in his office, stated the circumstances
to him.</p>
            <p>"These things are the fruits of imbecility; but I am
sorry to say there is no relief from them. We are a
curious people, and do a great many curious things according
to law, and leave a great many things undone
that the law and lawmakers ought to do. But I will
go with you to the jail, and whatever my influence will
effect is at your service," said the Colonel, putting on
his hat, and accompanying the Captain to the jail.</p>
            <p>Mr. Grimshaw had forestalled them, and after<pb n="214"/>
having given the jailer particular instructions to lock
Manuel up if he made any further complaint, and to
carry out his orders upon the peril of his situation,
met them a few steps from the outer gate, on his return.
"There, Captain!" said Grimshaw, making a
sort of halt, "I have given the jailer particular
orders in regard to your grumbling nigger!"</p>
            <p>Neither the Captain nor Colonel S—— took any
notice of his remarks, and passed on into the jail.
Colonel S—— interceded for the man, explaining the
circumstances which had unfortunately brought him
there, and begged the jailer's kind consideration in
his behalf. The jailer told them what his orders had
been, but promised to do as far as was in his power,
and to see any thing that was sent to him safely delivered.</p>
            <p>After leaving the jail, Colonel S—— proposed a
walk, and they proceeded along a street running at
right angles with the jail, until they came to a corner
where a large brick building was in process of erection.
The location was not in what might strictly be
called "the heart of the city," nor was it in the
suburbs. Carpenters and masons, both black and
white, were busily employed in their avocations, and
from the distance all seemed fair and moving with
despatch. As they approached nearer, cries and
moans sounded upon the air, and rose high above the
clatter of the artisans' work. The Captain quickened
his pace, but the colonel, as if from a consciousness
of the effect, halted, and would fain have retraced
his steps. "Come!" said the Captain, "let us hasten—they
are killing somebody!" They approached
the building, and entered by an open door in the basement.
The passage, or entry-way, was filled with all<pb n="215"/>
sorts of building materials; and on the left, another
door opened into a long basement apartment, with
loose boards laid upon the floor-joists overhead.
Here in this dark apartment was the suffering object
whose moans had attracted their attention. A large
billet of wood, about six feet long and three feet
square, which had the appearance of being used for
a chopping-block, laid near. A poor negro man,
apparently advanced in years, was stripped naked
and bent over the block, in the shape of a horse-shoe,
with his hands and feet closely pinioned to stakes,
driven in the ground on each side. His feet were
kept close together, and close up to the log, while he
was drawn over, tight by the hands, which were
spread open. Thus, with a rope around his neck,
tied in a knot at the throat, with each end carried to
the pinion where his hands were secured, his head
and neck were drawn down to the tightest point. The
very position was enough to have killed an ordinary
human being in less than six hours. His master, a
large, robust man, with a strong Irish brogue, started
at their appearance, as if alarmed at the presence of
intruders, while holding his hand in the attitude of
administering another blow. "There! you infernal
nigger; steal again, will you?" said he, frothing at
the mouth with rage—with his coat off, his shirt-sleeves
rolled up, and his face, hands, arms and shirt-bosom
so bespattered with blood, that a thrill of
horror ran through the Captain. On the ground lay
several pieces of hoop, broken and covered with blood,
while he held in his hand another piece, (which he
had torn from a lime-cask,) reeking with blood, presenting
the picture of a murderer bestained with the
blood of his victim. But the poor sufferer's <orig>punish-</orig>
               <pb n="216"/>
ment had wasted his strength,—his moans had become
so faint as to be scarcely perceptible. His
posteriors were so cut and mangled that we could
compare them to nothing but a piece of bullock's-liver,
with its tenacity torn by craven dogs. His body was
in a profuse perspiration, the sweat running from his
neck and shoulders, while the blood streamed from
his bruises, down his legs, and upon some shavings on
the ground. Just at this moment a boy brought a
pail of water, and set it down close by the tyrant's
feet. "Go away, boy!" said he, and the, boy left
as quick as possible. The Captain stood dismayed
at the bloody picture. </p>
            <p>"Unmerciful man!" said the colonel in a peremptory
tone; "what have you been doing here? You
fiend of hell, let the man up! You own slaves to
bring disgrace upon us in this manner! Epithets of
contempt and disgust are too good for you. It is
such beasts as you who are creating a popular hatred
against us, and souring the feelings of our countrymen.
Let the man up instantly; the very position
you have him in is enough to kill him, and, if I'm not
mistaken, you've killed him already."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, he's me own property, and it's yerself
won't lose a ha'penny if he's kilt. An' I'll warrant ye
he's cur't of stalin' better than the man beyant at the
wurk'o'se would be doin' if. Bad luck to the nager,
an' it's the second time he'd be doin' that same
thing," said he, as unconcernedly as if he had just
been killing a calf.</p>
            <p>"I'll 'your own' you, you miserable wretch! Your
abuse and cruel treatment of your slaves is becoming
a public thing; and if you a'n't very careful, something
will be done about it before council. If they<pb n="217"/>
are your own, you must not treat them worse than
dogs; they have feeling, if you have no compassion.
Be quick! release him at once!" demanded the colonel,
feeling the man's wrist and head.</p>
            <p>The tyrant vent deliberately to work, unloosing the
cords. This provoked the colonel still more, and
taking his knife from his pocket, he severed the cords
that bound his hands and feet, while as suddenly the
Captain sprang with his knife and severed those that
bound his hands and neck. "Stop, Captain, stop!
take no part," said the colonel, with a significant
look.</p>
            <p>"Gintlemen, I wish yes wouldn't interfere with my
own business," said the master.</p>
            <p>"Take him up, you villanous wretch! I speak to
you as you deserve, without restraint or respect,"
again the colonel repeated.</p>
            <p>He called to the boy who was bringing the pail of
water when they entered. He came forward, and
taking the poor fellow by the shoulders, this beast in
human form cried out, "Get up now, ye miserable
thief, ye." The poor fellow made a struggle, but as
the black man raised his head—which seemed to
hang as a dead weight—exhaustion had left him without
strength, and he fell back among the bloody
shavings like a mutilated mass of lifeless flesh.</p>
            <p>"None of your humbugging; yer worth a dozen
dead niggers anyhow," said he, taking up the pail of
water and throwing nearly half of it over him; then
passing the bucket to the black man and ordering
him to get more water and wash him down; then to
get some saltpetre and a sponge to sop his flesh.</p>
            <p>"Well," said the colonel, "I have seen a good deal
of cruelty to slaves, but this is the most beastly I<pb n="218"/>
have ever beheld. If you don't send for a doctor at
once, I shall report you. That man will die, to a
moral certainty. Now, you may depend upon what I
say—if that man dies, you'll feel the consequences,
and I shall watch you closely."</p>
            <p>"Sure I always takes care of me own niggers, an'
it's himself that won't be asked to do a stroke of work
for a week, but have the same to git well in," said the
tyrant as the colonel and Captain were leaving.</p>
            <p>"God be merciful to us, and spare us from the
savages of mankind. That scene, with its bloody
accompaniment, will haunt me through life. Do your
laws allow such things?" said the Captain, evidently
excited.</p>
            <p>"To tell the truth, Captain," said the colonel,
"our laws do not reach them. These men own a few
negroes, which, being property, they exercise absolute
control over; a negro's testimony being invalid, gives
them an unlimited power to abuse and inflict punishment;
while, if a white man attempts to report such
things, the cry of 'abolitionist' is raised against him,
and so many stand ready to second the cry, that he
must have a peculiar position if he does not prejudice
his own interests and safety. I am sorry it is so;
but it is too true, and while it stigmatizes the system,
it works against ourselves. The evil is in the defects
of the system, but the remedy is a problem with
diverse and intricate workings, which, I own, are
beyond my comprehension to solve. The reason why
I spoke to you as I did when you cut the pinions
from the man's hands, was to give you a word of precaution.
That is a bad man. Negroes would rather
be sold to a sugar plantation in Louisiana any time
than be sold to him. He soon works them down; in<pb n="219"/>
two years, fine, healthy fellows become lame, infirm,
and sickly under him; he never gives them a holiday,
and seldom a Sunday, and half-starves them at that.
If his feelings had been in a peculiar mood at the
instant you cut that cord, and he had not labored
under the fear of my presence, he would have raised
a gang of his stamp, and with the circumstance of
your being a stranger, the only alternative for your
safety would have been in your leaving the city."</p>
            <p>"That vagabond has beaten the poor creature so
that he will die; it can't be otherwise," said the
Captain.</p>
            <p>"Well, no; I think not, if he is well taken care of
for a week or so; but it's a chance if that brute gives
him a week to get well. When proud-flesh sets in,
it is very tedious; that is the reason, so far as the law
is concerned, that the lash was abolished and the
paddle substituted—the former mangled in the manner
you saw just now, while the latter is more acute and
bruises less. I have seen a nigger taken from the
paddle-frame apparently motionless and lifeless, very
little bruised, and not much blood drawn; but he
would come to and go to work in three or four days,"
said the colonel as they passed along together.</p>
            <p>We would print the name of this brute in human
form, that the world might read it, were it not for an
amiable wife and interesting family, whose feelings
we respect. We heard the cause of this cruel torture
a short time after, which was simply that he had
stolen a few pounds of nails, and this fomented the
demon's rage. In the manner we have described, this
ferocious creature had kept his victim for more than two
hours, beating him with the knotty hoops taken from
lime-casks. His rage would move at intervals, like<pb n="220"/>
gusts of wind during a gale. Thus, while his feelings
raged highest, he would vent them upon the flesh of
the poor pinioned wretch; then he would stop, rest
his arm, and pace the ground from wall to wall, and
as soon as his passion stormed, commence again and
strike the blows with all his power, at the same time
keeping the black boy standing with a bucket of water
in his hand ready to pour upon the wretch whenever
signs of fainting appeared. Several times, when the
copious shower came over him, it filled his mouth, so
that his cries resounded with a gurgling, death-like
noise, that made every sensation chill to hear it.
During this space of time, he inflicted more than three
hundred blows. Our information is from the man
who did his master's bidding—poured the water—and
dared not say, "Good massa, spare poor Jacob." We
visited the place about a month afterward, on a pretext
of examining the basement of the building, and
saw the unmistakable evidences of civilized torture
yet remaining in the ground and upon the shavings
that were scattered around.</p>
            <p>"Captain, you must not judge the institution of
slavery by what you saw there; that is only one of those
isolated cases so injurious in themselves, but for which
the general character of the institution should not be
held answerable," said the colonel.</p>
            <p>"A system so imperfect should be revised, lest innocent
men be made to suffer its wrongs," said the
Captain.</p>
            <p>They continued their walk through several very
pretty parts of the city, where fine flowering gardens
and well-trimmed hedges were nicely laid out; these,
however, were not the habitations of the "<emph>old families</emph>."
They occupied parts of the city designated<pb n="221"/>
by massive-looking old mansions, exhibiting an antiqueness
and mixed architecture, with dilapidated
court-yards and weather-stained walls, showing how
steadfast was the work of decay.</p>
            <p>The colonel pointed out the many military advantages
of the city, which would be used against Uncle
Sam if he meddled with South Carolina. He spoke
of them ironically, for he was not possessed of the
secession monomania. He had been a personal friend
of Mr. Calhoun, and knew his abstractions. He
knew Mr. McDuffie; Hamilton, (the transcendant, of
South Carolina fame;) Butler, of good component
parts—eloquent, but moved by fancied wrongs;
Rhett, renouncer of that vulgar name of Smith,
who hated man because he spoke, yet would not fight
because he feared his God; and betwixt them, a host
of worthies who made revenge a motto; and last, but
not least, great Quattlebum, whose strength and spirit
knows no bound, and brought the champion <emph>Commander</emph>,
with his enthusiastic devotion, to lead unfaltering forlorn
hopes. But he knew there was deception in the
political dealings of this circle of great names.</p>
            <p>Returning to the market, they took a social glass
at Baker's, where the colonel took leave of the Captain;
and the latter, intending to repair to his vessel,
followed the course of the market almost to its lowest
extreme. In one of the most public places of the
market, the Captain's attention was attracted by a
singular object of mechanism. It seemed so undefined
in its application, that he was reminded of the
old saying among sailors when they fall in with any
indescribable thing at sea, that it was a "fidge-fadge, to
pry the sun up with in cloudy weather." It was a
large pedestal about six feet high, with a sort of<pb n="222"/>
platform at the base for persons to stand upon, supplied
with two heavy rings about eight inches apart.
It was surmounted by an apex, containing an iron
shackle long enough for a sloop-of-war's best bower
chain, and just, beneath it was a nicely-turned moulding.
About three feet from the ground, and twelve
inches from the pedestal, were two pieces of timber
one above the other, with a space of some ten inches
between them, the upper one set about five inches
nearest the pedestal, also containing two rings, and
both supported by posts in the ground. Above the
whole was a framework, with two projecting timbers
supplied with rings, and standing about fourteen
inches in a diagonal direction above the big ring in
the apex of the shaft. It was altogether a curious
instrument, but it designated the civilization of the
age, upon the same principle that a certain voyager
who, on landing in a distant country, discovered
traces of civilization in the decaying remains of an
old gallows.</p>
            <p>He viewed the curious instrument for some time,
and then turning to an old ragged negro, whose head
and beard were whitened with the flour of age, said,
"Well, old man, what do you call that?"</p>
            <p>"Why, massa, him great t'ing dat—what big old
massa judge send buckra-man to get whip, so color
foke laugh when 'e ketch 'im on de back, ca' bim;
an' massa wid de cock-up hat on 'e head put on big
vip jus' so," said the old negro.</p>
            <p>It was the whipping-post, where white men, for
<emph>small</emph> thefts, were branded with ignominy and shame.</p>
            <p>"Are you a slave, old man?" inquired the Captain.</p>
            <p>The old man turned his head aside and pulled his
ragged garments, as if shame had stung his feelings.</p>
            <pb n="223"/>
            <p>"Do, good massa—old Simon know ye don'e belong
here-give him piece of 'bacca," replied the hoary-headed
veteran evidently intending to evade the
question. The Captain divided his "<hi>plug</hi>" with him,
and gave him a quarter to get more, but not to buy
whiskey. "Tank-e, massa, tank-e; he gone wid ole
Simon long time."</p>
            <p>"But you haven't answered my question; I asked
you if you were a slave."</p>
            <p>"Ah! massa, ye don'e know him how he is, ah
ha! ha! I done gone now. Massa Pringle own 'im
once, but 'im so old now, nobody say I own 'im, an'
ole Simon a'n't no massa what say I his fo' bacon. I
don't woff nofin' nohow now, 'cos I ole. When Simon
young—great time 'go—den massa say Simon his;
woff touzan' dollars; den me do eve' ting fo' massa
just so. I prime nigga den, massa; now I woff
nosin', no corn and bacon 'cept what 'im git from
Suke-e. She free; good massa make her free,"
said he.</p>
            <p>"How old are you, old man?" inquired the
Captain.</p>
            <p>"Ah, Massa Stranger, ye got ole Simon da! If
me know dat, den 'im know somefin' long time ago,
what buckra-man don' larn. I con'try-born nigger,
massa, but I know yonder Massa Pringle house fo'
he built 'im." Just at this moment several pieces of
cannon and other ordnance were being drawn past
on long, low-wheeled drays. "Ah, massa, ye don'e
know what 'em be," said the old negro, pointing to
them. "Dem wa' Massa South Ca'lina gwan to
whip de 'Nited States wid Massa Goberna' order
'em last year, an 'e jus' come. Good masse gwan'
to fight fo' we wid 'em." The poor old man seemed<pb n="224"/>
to take a great interest in the pieces of ordnance as
they passed along, and to have inherited all the
pompous ideas of his master. The negroes about
Charleston have a natural inclination for military
tactics, and hundreds of ragged urchins, as well as
old <emph>daddies</emph> and mammies, may be seen following the
fife and drum on parade days.</p>
            <p>"Then I suppose you've a home anywhere, and a
master nowhere, old man?" said the Captain, shaking
him by the hand, as one who had worn out his slavery
to be disowned in the winter of life.</p>

         <div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
            <head type="sub">COPELAND'S RELEASE, AND MANUEL'S CLOSE CONFINEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE Captain of the Janson, finding that no dependence
was to be placed upon the statements of the
officials, after returning to his vessel, gave orders
that Tommy should be sent to the jail every day with
provisions for Manuel. The task was a desirable one
for Tommy, and every day about ten o'clock he
might be seen trudging to the jail with a haversack
under his arm. There were five stewards confined in
the cell, and for some days previous to this attention
on the part of the Captain they had been
reduced to the last stage of necessity. The quantity
may be considered as meagre when divided
among so many, but added to the little things brought
in by Jane, and presents from several of the crew of
the Janson, they got along. Still it was a <orig>depend-</orig>
               <pb n="225"/>
ence upon chance and charity, which any casual
circumstance might affect. For several days they
made themselves as contented and happy as the circumstances
would admit; and always being anxious
to enjoy the privilege of their time in the yard, they
would leave their cell together, and mix with the prisoners
of their own color under the stoop.</p>
            <p>After a few days, they found that their cell had
been entered, and nearly all their provisions stolen.
Not contented with this, the act was repeated for
several days, and all the means they provided to
detect the thief proved fruitless. The jailer made several
searches through their remonstrances, but without
effecting any thing. They kept their provisions in a
little box, which they locked with a padlock; but as
Daley had the keys of the cell, they had no means of
locking the door. At length Manuel set a trap that
proved effectual. One morning Tommy came puffing
into the jail with a satchel over his back. "I guess
Manuel won't feel downhearted when he sees this—do
you think he will?" said the little fellow, as he
put the satchel upon the floor and looked up at the
jailer. "An' I've got some cigars, too, the Captain
sent, in my pocket," said he, nodding his head; and
putting his hand into a side-pocket, pulled out one
and handed it to the jailer.</p>
            <p>"Ah! you are a good little fellow—worth a dozen
of our boys. Sit down and rest yourself," said the
jailer, and called a monstrous negro wench to bring
a chair and take the satchel up to the cell. Then
turning to the back-door, he called Manuel; and, as
if conscious of Tommy's arrival, the rest of the
stewards followed. He sprang from the chair as soon
as he saw Manuel, and running toward him, <orig>com-</orig>
               <pb n="226"/>
menced telling him what he had got in the satchel
and at the same time pulled out a handful of segars
that the Captain had sent for himself. Manuel led
the way up-stairs, followed by Tommy and the train
of stewards. Tommy opened the satchel, while
Manuel laid the contents, one by one, on the table
which necessity had found in the head of a barrel.</p>
            <p>"Now eat, my friends, eat just as much as you want,
and then I'll catch the thief that breaks my lock and
steals my meat. I catch him," said Manuel. After
they had all done, he locked the balance up in his
box, and sent everybody down-stairs into the yard,
first covering himself with two mattrasses, and giving
orders to Copeland to lock the door after him. Every
thing was ready to move at the word. In this position
he remained for nearly half an hour. At length
he heard a footstep approach the door, and then the
lock clink. The door opened slowly, and the veritable
Mr. Daley limped in, and taking a key from his
pocket, unlocked the little box, and filling his tin pan,
locked it, and was walking off as independent as a
wood-sawyer, making a slight whistle to a watch that
was stationed at the end of the passage. "It's you,
is it?" said Manuel, suddenly springing up and giving
him a blow on the side of the head that sent him and
the contents of the pan into a promiscuous pile on
the floor. Daley gathered himself up and made an
attempt to reach the door, but Manuel, fearing what
might be the consequence if the other prisoners came
to his assistance, shut the door before him and fastened
it on the inside.</p>
            <p>"Bad luck to yer infernal eyes, will ye strike a
white man, ye nager ye, in a country like this same?"
said Daley, as he was gathering himself up. This<pb n="227"/>
incensed Manuel's feelings still more. To have
insult added to injury, and a worthless drunkard and
thief abuse him, was more than he could bear. He
commenced according to a sailor's rule of science,
and gave Daley a systematic threshing, which,
although against the rules of the jail, was declared
by several of the prisoners to be no more than he
had long deserved. As may have been expected,
Daley cried lustily for help, adding the very convenient
item of murder, to make his case more alarming.
Several persons had crowded around the door,
but none could gain admittance. The jailer had no
sooner reached the door, than (most unfortunately for
Manuel) he was called back to the outer door, to
admit Mr. Grimshaw, who had just rung the bell.
The moment he entered, Daley's noise was loudest,
and reached his ears before he had gained the outside
gate. He rushed up-stairs, followed by the jailer,
and demanded entrance at the cell door, swearing at
the top of his voice that he would break it in with an
axe if the command was not instantly obeyed.</p>
            <p>The door opened, and Manuel stood with his left
hand extended at Daley. "Come in, gentlemen, I
catch him, one rascal, what steal my provision every
day, and I punish him, what he remember when I
leave."</p>
            <p>Daley stood trembling against the wall, bearing
the marks of serious injury upon his face and eyes.
"At it again, Daley? Ah! I thought you had left off
them tricks!" said the jailer.</p>
            <p>Daley began to tell a three-cornered story, and to
give as many possible excuses, with equally as many
characteristic bulls in them. "I don't want to hear
your story, Daley," said Mr. Grimshaw. "But, Mr.<pb n="228"/>
Jailer, I command you to lock that man up in the
third story," pointing to Manuel. "I don't care what
the circumstances are. He's given us more trouble
than he's worth. He tried to pass himself off for a
white man, but he couldn't come that, and now he's
had the impudence to strike a white man; lock him
up! lock him up!! and keep him locked up until
further orders from me. I'll teach him a lesson that
he never learnt before he came to South Carolina;
and then let Consul Mathew sweat over him, and
raise another fuss if he can."</p>
            <p>"If he's guilty of violating the rules of the jail,
Daley is guilty of misdemeanour, and the thieving has
been aggravatingly continued. If we put one, we
must put both up," said the jailer.</p>
            <p>"Just obey my orders, Mr. Jailer. I will reprimand
Daley to-morrow. I shall just go to the
extent of the law with that feller," said Grimshaw
peremptorily.</p>
            <p>"You may lock me up in a dungeon, do with me
as you will, if the power is yours; but my feelings
are my own, and you cannot crush them. I look to
my consul, and the country that has protected me
around the world, and can protect me still," said
Manuel, resigning himself to the jailer, whose intentions
he knew to be good.</p>
            <p>Poor little Tommy stood begging and crying for
his friend and companion, for he heard Mr. Grimshaw
give an imperative order to the jailer not to allow
visitors into his cell. "Never mind, Tommy, we
shall soon meet again, and sail companions for the old
owners. Don't cry; the jailer will let you see me to-morrow,"
said Manuel.</p>
            <p>"No, I can't do that; you heard my orders; I<pb n="229"/>
must obey them. I should like to do it, but it's out
of my power," returned the jailer, awaiting with a
bunch of keys in his hand.</p>
            <p>Manuel turned to the little fellow, and kissing him
as he would an affectionate child, bade him adieu, and
ascended, the steps leading to the third story (Mount
Rascal) in advance of the jailer, to be confined in a
dark, unhealthy cell, there to await the caprice of
one man. To describe this miserable hole would be
a task too harrowing to our feelings. We pass it for
those who will come after us. He little thought,
when he shook the hand of his little companion, that
it was the last time he should meet him for many
months, and then only to take a last parting look,
under the most painful circumstances. But such is
the course of life!</p>
            <p>Copeland had received notice to hold himself in
readiness, as his vessel would be ready for sea the next
morning. He was not long in getting his few things
in order, and when morning came he was on hand,
prepared to bound from the iron confines of the
Charleston jail, like a stag from a thicket. As he
bade good-by to his fellow-prisoners in the morning,
he said, "This is my last imprisonment in Charleston.
I have been imprisoned in Savannah, but there I had
plenty to eat, comfortable apartments, and every
thing I asked for, except my liberty. Never, so long
as I sail the water, shall I ship for such a port as
this again." He requested to see Manuel, but being
refused, upon the restraint of orders, he left the jail.
It was contrary to law; and thus in pursuing his vocation
within the limits of South-Carolina, his owners
were made to pay the following sum, for which<pb n="230"/>
neither they nor the man who suffered the imprisonment
received any compensation.</p>

            <p>IN order to complete the four characters, as we designed
in the outset, we must here introduce the persons
whose names fill the caption. The time of their
imprisonment was some two months later than Manuel's
release; but we introduce them here for the
purpose of furnishing a clear understanding of the
scenes connected with Manuel's release.</p>
            <p>John Paul was a fine-looking French negro, very
dark, with well-developed features, and very intelligent,—what
would be called in South Carolina, "a very
prime feller." He was steward on board of the
French bark Senegal, Captain ——. He spoke excellent
French and Spanish, and read Latin very
well,—was a Catholic, and paid particular respect to
devotional exercises,—but unfortunately he could not
speak or understand a word of English. In all our
observation of different characters of colored men,
we do not remember to have seen one whose pleasant
manner, intelligence, and civility, attracted more
general attention. But he could not comprehend the
meaning of the law imprisoning a peaceable man
without crime, and why the authorities should fear
him, when he could not speak their language. He
wanted to see the city—what sort of people were in
it—if they bore any analogy to their good old forefathers
in France; and whether they had inherited
the same capricious feelings as the descendants of the<pb n="232"/>
same generation on the other side of the water.
There could be no harm in that; and although he
knew something of French socialism, he was ignorant
of Carolina's peculiar institutions, her politics, and
her fears of abolition, as a "Georgia
cracker"<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>A sort of semi-civilized native, wearing a peculiar homespun
dress; with a native dialect strongly resembling many of the
Yorkshire phrases. They are generally found located in the
poorer parishes and districts, where their primitive-looking cabins
are easily designated from that of the more enterprising agriculturist.
But few of them can read or write,—and preferring the
coarsest mode of life, their habits are extremely dissolute. Now
and then one may be found owning a negro or two,—but a negro
would rather be sold to the torments of hell, or a Louisiana sugar-planter,
than to a Georgia cracker. You will see them approaching
the city on market-days, with their travelling-cart, which is
a curiosity in itself. It is a two-wheeled vehicle of the most primitive
description, with long, rough poles for shafts or thills.
Sometimes it is covered with a blanket, and sometimes with a
white rag, under which are a few things for market, and the
good wife, with sometimes one or two wee-yans; for the liege lord
never fails to bring his wife to market, that she may see the
things of the city. The dejected-looking frame of some scrub-breed
horse or a half-starved mule is tied (for we can't call it
harnessed) between the thills, with a few pieces of rope and
withes; and, provided with a piece of wool-tanned sheep-skin, the
lord of the family, with peculiar dress, a drab slouched hat over
his eyes, and a big whip in his hand, mounts on the back of the
poor animal, and placing his feet upon the thills to keep them
down, tortures it through a heavy, sandy road. The horses are
loaded so much beyond their strength, that they will stop to
blow, every ten or fifteen minutes, while the man will sit upon
their backs with perfect unconcern. Remonstrate with them in
regard to the sufficient draught added to the insupportable
weight upon their backs, and they will immediately commence
demonstrating how he can draw easier when there is an immense
weight upon his back. The husband generally exchanges his
things for whiskey, rice, and tobacco, while the wife buys calico
and knick-knacks. Sometimes they get "a right smart chance o'
things" together, and have a "party at home," which means a
<emph>blow-out</emph> among themselves. Sometimes they have a shucking,
which is a great affair, even. among the little farmers in Upper
Georgia, where, only, corn-shuckings are kept up with all the spice
of old custom, and invitations are extended to those at a distance
of ten or fifteen miles, who repay the compliment with their presence,
and join in the revelry. There are two classes of the
cracker in Georgia, according to our observation, differing somewhat
in their dialect, but not in their habits. One is the upper,
and the other the low country, or rather what some call the
"<emph>co-u-n-try-b-o-r-n</emph>" cracker. The up-country cracker gives
more attention to farming, inhabits what's known as the Cherokee
country and its vicinity, and is designated by the sobriquet of
"<emph>wire-grass man</emph>."</p>
               </note>
would be of Greek. Like his predecessors in confinement,
he fell into the hands of the veritable
Dunn, without the assistance of his friend Duse, as
he called him; but had it not been for the timely
appearance of a clerk in the French consul's office,
who explained the nature of the arrest, in his native
tongue, Mr. Dunn would have found some trouble in
making the arrest. Already had the officers and
crew of the bark gathered around him, making grimaces,
and gibbering away like a flock of blackbirds
surrounding a hawk, and just ready to pounce.
"Don't I'se be tellin' yees what I wants wid 'im, and
the divil a bit ye'll understand me. Why don't yees
spake so a body can understand what yees be blatherin'
about. Sure, here's the paper, an' yees won't
read the English of it. The divil o' such a fix I was
ever in before wid yer John o' crapue's an' yer
chatter. Ye say we—we—we; sure it's but one I
wants. Ah! whist now, captain, and don't ye be makin'
a bother over it. Shure, did ye niver hear o' South
Carolina in the wide world? An' ye bees travellin' all
over it, and herself's such a great State, wid so many
great gintlemen in it," said Dunn, talking his green-island
Greek to the Frenchman.</p>
            <pb n="233"/>
            <p>"<hi>We, we! mon Dieu, ah</hi>!" said the Frenchman.</p>
            <p>"Ah, shure there ye are again. What would I be
doin' wid de 'hole o' yees? It's the nager I want. Don't
ye know that South Carolina don't allow the likes o'<pb n="234"/>
him to be comin ashore and playing the divil wid her
slaves," continued Dunn, stretching himself up on his
lame leg.</p>
            <p>The clerk stepped up at this moment. "It's 'imself'll
be telling yes all about it, for yer like a
parcel of geese makin' a fuss about a goslin." Mr.
Dunn had got his Corkonian blood up; and although
the matter was explained, he saw the means at hand,
and fixed his feelings for a stiff compensation. The
clerk, after explaining to the captain, turned to John
Paul and addressed him. As soon as he was done,
John commenced to pack up his dunnage and get
money from the captain, as if he was bound on an
Arctic Expedition. Dunn's eyes glistened as he saw
the money passing into Paul's hand; but he was not
to be troubled with the dunnage, and after hurrying
him a few times, marched him off. He went through
the regular system of grog-shop sponging; but his
suavity and willingness to acquiesce in all Mr. Dunn's
demands, saved him some rough usage. There was
this difference between John Paul and Manuel, that
the former, not understanding the English language,
mistook Dunn's deception for friendship, and moved
by that extreme French politeness and warmth of<pb n="235"/>
feeling, which he thought doing the gentleman par
excellence; while the latter, with a quicker perception
of right and wrong, and understanding our language,
saw the motive and disdained its nefarious object.
For when Paul arrived at the jail he was minus a
five-dollar gold-piece, which his very amiable official
companion took particular care of, lest something
should befall it. Poor John Paul! He was as harmless
as South Carolina's secession and chivalry—two
of the most harmless things in the world, not excepting
Congressional duelling.</p>
            <p>As soon as he entered the jail and found that the
jailer could speak French, he broke out in a perfect
tornado of enthusiasm. "Je serai charmé de lier
connaissance avec un si amiable compagnon," said he,
and continued in a strain so swift and unabated that
it would have been impossible for an Englishman to
have traced the inflections.</p>
            <p>The jailer called Daley, and telling him to take his
blanket, the State's allotment, ordered him shown to
his cell. Daley took the blanket under his arm and
the keys in his hand, and Paul soon followed him upstairs
to be introduced to his cell. "There, that's
the place for yees. We takes the shine off all ye
dandy niggers whin we gets ye here. Do ye see the
pair of eyes in the head o' me?" said Daley, pointing
to his blackened eyes; "an' he that done that same
is in the divil's own place above. Now, if ye have
ever a drap of whiskey, don't be keepin' it shy, an'
it'll be tellin' ye a good many favors."</p>
            <p>"Ah! mon Dieu! Cela fait dresser les cheveux à
la tête," said Paul, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
            <p>"Bad luck to the word of that I'd be understandin'
at all, at all. Can't ye spake so a body'd understand
what ye'd mane?"</p>
            <pb n="236"/>
            <p>"C'est ma grande consolation d'avoir. *  *  *
Les Etats-Unis est une modéle de perfection républicaine,"
said he, taking the blanket from Daley and
throwing it upon the floor. He was but a poor companion
for his fellow-prisoners, being deprived of the
means to exercise his social qualities. He went through
the same course of suffering that Manuel did; but, whether
from inclination or necessity, bore it with more
Christian fortitude, chanting vespers every morning,
and reading the Latin service every evening. The
lesson which Manuel taught Daley proved of great
service to Paul, who gave Daley the jail-ration which
it was impossible for him to eat, and was saved from
his pilfering propensities. Thus, after John Paul had
suffered thirty-five days' imprisonment, in <emph>mute</emph> confinement,
to satisfy the majesty of South Carolina, he
was released upon the following conditions, and taken
to his vessel at early daylight, lest he should see the
city or leave something to contaminate the slaves.</p>

            <p>A very nice item of disbursements to present to
the owners—a premium paid for the advanced civilization
of South Carolina!</p>
            <p>We have merely noticed the imprisonment of John
Paul, our limits excluding the details. We must now
turn to a little, pert, saucy French boy, eleven years
old, who spoke nothing but Creole French, and that
as <emph>rotten</emph> as we ever heard lisped. The French bark
Nouvelle Amelie, Gilliet, master, from Rouen, arrived
in Charleston on the twenty-ninth of July. The
captain was a fine specimen of a French gentleman.
He stood upon the quarter-deck as she was being
"breasted-in" to the wharf, giving orders to his men,
while the little child stood at the galley looking at
the people upon the wharf, making grimaces and
pointing one of the crew to several things that attracted
his attention. Presently the vessel hauled
alongside of the dock, and Dusenberry, with his companion
Dunn, who had been watching all the movements
of the vessel from a hiding-place on the wharf,
sprang out and boarded her ere she had touched the
piles.</p>
            <p>The "nigger," seeing Dusenberry approach him,
waited until he saw his hand extended, and then, as
if to save himself from impending danger, ran aft and
into the cabin, screaming at the top of his voice.
The crew began to run and move up into close quarters.
The issue was an important one, and rested
between South Carolina and the little "nigger." Dusenberry
attempted to descend into the cabin. "Vat
you vant wid my John, my Baptiste? No, you no do
dat, 'z my cabin ; never allow stranger go down 'im,"
said the captain, placing himself in the companionway,
while the little terrified nigger peeped above<pb n="238"/>
the combing, and rolled his large eyes, the white glowing
in contrast, from behind the captain's legs. In
this tempting position the little darkie, knowing he
was protected by the captain and crew, would taunt
the representative of the State with his bad French.
Dunn stood some distance behind Dusenberry, upon
the deck, and the mission seemed to be such a mystery
to both captain and crew, that their presence
aroused a feeling of curiosity as well as anxiety.
Several of the sailors gathered around him, and made
antic grimaces, pointing their fingers at him and
swearing, so that Dunn began to be alarmed by the
incomprehensible earnestness of their gibberish,
turned pale, and retreated several steps, to the infinite
amusement of those upon the wharf.</p>
            <p>Vat 'e do, ah, you vant 'im? Vat you do vid 'im
ven zu gets him, ah? Cette affaire délicate demande,"
said one of the number, who was honored
with the title of mate, and who, with a terrific black
moustache and beard, had the power of contorting
his face into the most repugnant grimaces. And, at
the moment, he drew his sheath-knife and made a
pretended plunge at Dunn's breast, causing him to
send forth a pitiful yell, and retreat to the wharf with
quicker movements than he ever thought himself
capable of.</p>
            <p>"Il n'y a pas grand mal à cela," said the Frenchman,
laughing at Dunn as he stood upon the capsill
of the wharf.</p>
            <p>"Bad luck to ye, a pretty mess a murderous
Frinchmin that ye are. Do yees be thinkin' ye'd
play that trick in South Carolina? Ye'll get the
like o' that taken out o' ye whin yer before his honor
in the mornin'," said Dunn.</p>
            <pb n="239"/>
            <p>Dusenberry had stood parleying with the captain
at the companion-door, endeavoring to make the
latter understand that it was not a case which required
the presence of the silver oar. There is a prevailing
opinion among sailors, that no suit in Admiralty can
be commenced, or seaman arrested while on board,
without the presence of the silver oar. And thus
acting upon this impression, the captain and officers
of the Nouvelle Amelie contended for what they considered
a right. The mate and crew drew closer
and closer toward Dusenberry, until he became infected
with the prevailing alarm. "Captain, I
demand your protection from these men, in the name
of the State of South Carolina," said he.</p>
            <p>"Who he? De State Souf Ca'lina, vat I know
'bout him, ah? Bring de silver oar when come take
my man. II y a de la malhommé, teté dans sou procés,"
said Captain Gilliet, turning to his mate.</p>
            <p>"Avaunt! avaunt!" said the big man with the
large whiskers, and they all made a rush at Dusenberry,
and drove him over the rail and back to the
wharf, where he demanded the assistance of those
anxious spectators, for and in the name of the State.
It was a right good vaudeville comique, played in
dialogue and pantomime. The point of the piece,
which, with a little arrangement, might have made
an excellent production, consisted of a misunderstanding
between an Irishman and a Frenchman about
South Carolina, and a law so peculiar that no stranger
could comprehend its meaning at first and as neither
could understand the language of the other, the more
they explained the more confounded the object became,
until, from piquant comique, the scene was
worked into the appearance of a tragedy. One <orig>re-</orig>
               <pb n="240"/>
presented his ship, and to him his ship was his nation;
the other represented South Carolina, and to him
South Carolina was the United States; and the
question was, which had the best right to the little
darkie.</p>
            <p>The spectators on the wharf were not inclined to
move, either not wishing to meddle themselves with
South Carolina's affairs—wanting larger game to
show their bravery—or some more respectable officer
to act in command. The little darkie, seeing Dusenberry
driven to the wharf, ran to the gangway, and
protruding his head over the rail, worked his black
phiz into a dozen pert expressions, showing his ivory,
rolling the white of his eyes, and crooking his finger
upon his nose in aggravating contempt.</p>
            <p>"Shure, we'll turn the guard out and take ye an'
yer ship, anyhow. Why don't yees give the nager up
dasently, an' don't be botherin'. An' isn't it the law
of South Carolina, be dad; an' be the mortis, ye'd
be getting' no small dale of a pinalty for the same yer
doin'," said Dunn.</p>
            <p>A gentleman, who had been a silent looker-on,
thinking it no more than proper to proffer his mediation,
perceiving where the difficulty lay, stepped on
board and introducing himself to the captain, addressed
him in French, and explained the nature of the proceeding.
The captain shook his head for some time,
and shrugged his shoulders. "La police y est bien
administrée," said he, with an air of politeness; and
speaking to his mate, that officer again spoke to the
men, and Dusenberry was told by the gentleman that
he could come on board. Without further ceremony, he
mounted the rail and made a second attempt at the
young urchin, who screamed and ran into the cook's<pb n="241"/>
galley, amid the applause of the seamen, who made
all sorts of shouts inciting him to run, crying out,
"Run, Baptiste! run, Baptiste!" In this manner the
little darkie kept the officer at bay for more than
fifteen minutes, passing out of one door as the officer
entered the other, to the infinite delight of the crew.
At length his patience became wearied, and as he was
about to call Dunn to his assistance, the captain came
up, and calling the child to him—for such he was—delivered
him up, the little fellow roaring at the top
of his voice as the big officer carried him over the
rail under his arm. This ended the vaudeville comique
on board of the French bark Nouvelle Amelie, Captain
Gilliet.</p>
            <p>The dignity of the State was triumphant, and the
diminutive nigger was borne off under the arm of its
representative. What a beautiful theme for the painter's
imagination! And how mutely sublime would
have been the picture if the pencil of a Hogarth
could have touched it. The majesty of South Carolina
carrying a child into captivity!</p>
            <p>After carrying John Baptiste about halfway up
the wharf, they put him down, and made him "<emph>trot
it</emph>" until they reached the Dutch grog-shop we have
described in the scene with Manuel. Here they
halted to take a "stiff'ner," while Baptiste was ordered
to sit down upon a bench, Dunn taking him by the
collar and giving him a hearty shake, which made
the lad bellow right lustily. "Shut up, ye whelp
of a nigger, or ye'll get a doz for yeer tricks beyant
in the ship," said Dunn; and after remaining nearly
an hour, arguing politics and drinking toddies, Mr.
Dunn got very amiably fuddled, and was for having
a <emph>good-natured</emph> quarrel with every customer that<pb n="242"/>
came; into the shop. He laboured under a spirit-inspired
opinion that they must treat or fight; and
accordingly would attempt to reduce his opinions to
practical demonstrations. At length the Dutchman
made a courteous remonstrance, but no sooner had he
done it, than Dunn drew his hickory stick across the
Dutchman's head, and levelled him upon the floor.
The Dutchman was a double-fisted fellow, and springing
up almost instantly, returned the compliment.
Dusenberry was more sober, and stepped in to make
a reconciliation; but before he had time to exert
himself, the Dutchman running behind the counter,
Dunn aimed another blow at him, which glanced from
his arm and swept a tin drench, with a number of
tumblers on it, into a smash upon the floor. This
was the signal for a general melée, and it began in
right earnest between the Dutch and the Irish,—for
the Dutchman called the assistance of several kinsmen
who were in the front store, and Dunn, with the
assistance of Dusenberry, mustered recruits from
among a number of his cronies, who were standing
at a corner on the opposite side, of the street. Both
came to the rescue, but the O'Nales and Finnegans
outnumbering the Dutch, made a Donnybrook onset,
disarming and routing their adversaries, and
capsizing barrels, boxes, kegs, decanters, and baskets
of onions, into one general chaos,—taking possession
of the Dutchman's calabash, and proclaiming their
victory with triumphant shouts.</p>
            <p>They had handcuffed the boy Baptiste as soon as
they entered the store, and in the midst of the conflict
he escaped without being observed, and ran for
his vessel, handcuffed, and crying at the top of his
voice. He reached the Nouvelle Amelie, to the<pb n="243"/>
consummate surprise of the officers and crew, and the
alarm of pedestrians as he passed along the street.
"Mon Dieu!" said the mate, and taking the little
fellow to the windlass-bits, succeeded in severing the
handcuffs with a cold-chisel, and sent him down
into the forecastle to secrete himself. </p>
            <p>When Dunn's wild Irish had subsided, Dusenberry
began to reason with him upon the nature of the
affair, and the matter was reconciled upon the obligations
that had previously existed, and a promise to
report no violations of the ordinances during a specified
time. Looking around, Dunn exclaimed, "Bad
manners till ye, Swizer, what a' ye done with the
little nager? Where did ye put him?—Be dad,
Duse, he's gone beyant!" An ineffectual search
was made among barrels and boxes, and up the old
chimney. "Did ye see him?" inquired Dunn, of a
yellow man that had been watching the affray at the
door, while Dusenberry continued to poke with his
stick among the boxes and barrels.</p>
            <p>"Why, massa, I sees him when he lef de doo, but
I no watch him 'till 'e done gone," said the man.</p>
            <p>Dunn was despatched to the vessel in search, but
every thing there was serious wonderment, and carried
out with such French navïeté, that his suspicions
were disarmed, and he returned with perfect confidence
that he was not <emph>there</emph>. A search was now
made in all the negro-houses in the neighborhood;
but kicks, cuts, and other abuses failed to elicit
any information of his whereabouts. At length Dunn
began to feel the deadening effects of the liquor, and
was so muddled that he could not stand up; then,
taking possession of a bed in one of the houses, he
stretched himself upon it in superlative contempt of<pb n="244"/>
every thing official, and almost simultaneously fell
into a profound sleep. In this manner he received
the attention of the poor colored woman whose bed
he occupied, and whom he had abused in searching
for the boy. In this predicament, Dusenberry continued
to search alone, and kept it up until sundown,
when he was constrained to report the case to the
sheriff, who suspended Mr. Dunn for a <emph>few</emph> days.
The matter rested until the next morning, when the
case of the little saucy nigger abbrvs. South Carolina
was renewed with fresh vigor. Then Mr. Grimshaw,
accompanied by Dusenberry, proceeded to the barque,
and there saw the boy busily engaged in the galley.
Mr. Grimshaw went on board, followed by <emph>Duse</emph>, and
approaching the cabin door, met the captain ascending
the stairs. "Captain, I want that nigger boy of
yourn, and you may just as well give him up peaceably,"
said he.</p>
            <p>"Yes, monsieur,—but you no treat 'im like child
wen you get 'im," said the captain. Retiring to the
cabin, and bringing back the broken manacles in his
hand, he held them up to Mr. Grimshaw, "You put
such dem thing on child like 'im, in South Carolina,
ah? What you tink 'im be, young nigger, ox, horse,
bull, ah! what? Now you take'e him! treat him
like man, den we no 'struct to laws wat South Carolina
got," continued he.</p>
            <p>Mr. Grimshaw thanked the captain, but made no
reply about the manacles; taking them in his hand,
and handing the boy over into the charge of Dusenberry.
In a few minutes he was ushered into the
sheriff's office, and the important points of his dimensions
and features noted in accordance with the
law. We are not advised whether the pert <orig>character-</orig>
               <pb n="245"/>
istics of his nature were emblazoned,—if they were,
the record would describe a singular specimen of a
frightened French darkie, more amusing than judicial.
But John Baptiste Pamerlie passed the ordeal,
muttering some rotten Creole, which none of the
officials could understand, and was marched off to
the jail, where the jailer acted as his interpreter.
Being so small, he was allowed more latitude to <hi>ware
and haul</hi> than the others, while his peculiar bon
point and pert chatter afforded a fund of amusement
for the prisoners, who made him a particular
<emph>butt</emph>, and kept up an incessant teasing to hear him
jabber. The second day of his imprisonment he received
a loaf of bread in the morning, and a pint of
greasy water, misnamed soup. That was the allowance
when they <emph>did not take meat</emph>. He ran down-stairs
with the pan in hand, raising an amusing fuss,
pointing at it, and spitting out his Creole to the
jailer. He was disputing the question of its being
soup, and his independent manner had attracted a
number of the prisoners. Just at the moment, the
prison dog came fondling against his legs, and to
decide the question, quick as thought, he set the pan
before him; and as if acting upon an instinctive
knowledge of the point at issue, the dog put his nose
to it, gave a significant scent, shook his head and
walked off, to the infinite delight of the prisoners,
who sent forth a shout of acclamation. Baptiste left
his soup, and got a prisoner, who could speak Creole,
to send for his captain, who came on the next morning
and made arrangements to relieve his condition
from the ship's stores. The following day he whipped
one of the jailer's boys in a fair fight; and on
the next he killed a duck, and on the fourth he cut a<pb n="246"/>
white prisoner. Transgressing the rules of the jail
in rejecting his soup—violating the laws of South
Carolina making it a heinous offence for a negro to
strike or insult a white person—committing murder
on a duck—endeavoring to get up a fandango among
the yard niggers, and trying the qualities of cold
steel, in a prisoner's hand, thus exhibiting all the
versatility of a Frenchman's genius with a youthful
sang-froid, he was considered decidedly dangerous,
and locked up for formal reform. Here he remained
until the seventeenth of August, when it was announced
that the good barque Nouvelle Amelie, Captain
Gilliet, was ready for sea, and he was forthwith
led to the wharf between two officers, and ordered to
be transferred beyond the limits of the State, the
Captain paying the following nice little bill, of costs.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE JANSON CONDEMNED.</head>
            <p>WE must now return to Manuel. He was in
close confinement, through Mr. Grimshaw's orders.
Tommy continued to bring him food from day to day,
but was not allowed to see him. The mate and several
of the crew were also refused admittance to him.
This was carrying power to an unnecessary limit,
and inflicting a wanton punishment without proper
cause, at the same time exhibiting a flagrant disrespect
for personal feelings. Tommy did not report
the affair to the Captain, lest it should be misconstrued,
and worse punishment be inflicted; but when
the men were refused, they naturally mistrusted
something, and made inquiries of the jailer, who
readily gave them all the information in his power
concerning the affair, and his orders. This they reported
to the Captain, who immediately repaired to
the consul's office, where he found Mr. Mathew reading
a note which he had just received from Manuel.
It stated his grievances in a clear and distinct manner,
and begged the protection of that government
under whose flag he sailed, but said nothing about
his provisions. The consul, accompanied by the Captain,
proceeded to the sheriff's office, but could get
no satisfaction. "I never consider circumstances<pb n="248"/>
when prisoners violate the rules of the jail,—he must
await my orders! but I shall keep him closely confined
for two weeks, at least," said Mr. Grimshaw.</p>
            <p>This incensed the consul still more, for he saw the
manner in which a clique of officials were determined
to show their arbitrary power. It was impossible
for him to remain indifferent to this matter, affecting,
as it did, the life and liberty of his fellow-countryman.
He could invoke no sympathy for the man,
and the extent of punishment to which he had been
subjected was evidently excited by vindictive feelings.
He applied for a writ of habeas corpus,—but
mark the result.</p>
            <p>The Captain proceeded to the jail, and demanded
to see his steward; the jailer hesitating at first, at
length granted his permission. He found Manuel
locked up in a little, unwholesome cell, with scarcely a
glimmer of light to mark the distinction of day and
night; and so pale and emaciated, that had he met
him in the street he should scarcely have recognised
him. "Gracious God! What crime could have
brought such an excess of punishment upon you?"
inquired the Captain.</p>
            <p>Manuel told him the whole story; and, added to
that, the things which had been sent to him during
the seven days he had been confined in that manner,
had seldom reached him. He had lost his good
friend Jane, and the many kind acts which she was
wont to bestow upon him, and had been compelled to
live upon bread and water nearly the whole time, suffering
the most intense hunger. Upon inquiry, it was
ascertained that the few things sent to make him
comfortable had been intrusted to Daley to deliver,
who appropriated nearly the whole of them to his<pb n="249"/>
own use, as a sort of retaliatory measure for the
castigation he received from Manuel. He had not
failed to carry him his pan of soup at twelve o'clock
every day, but made the "<emph>choice bits</emph>" serve his own
digestion. The jailer felt the pain of the neglect,
and promised to arrange a safer process of forwarding
his things by attending to it himself, which he
did with all the attention in his power, when Manuel's
condition became more tolerable. The Captain told
Manuel how his affairs stood—that he should probably
have to leave him in charge of the consul, but
to keep up good spirits; that he would leave him
plenty of means, and as soon as his release was
effected, to make the best of his way to Scotland and
join the old owners. And thus he left him, with a
heavy heart, for Manuel did read in his countenance
what he did not speak.</p>
            <p>The Janson had been discharged, a survey held
upon the cargo, protest extended, and the whole sold
for the benefit of whom it might concern. Necessary
surveys were likewise held upon the hull, and finding
it so old and strained as to be unworthy of repair, it
was condemned and sold for the benefit of the underwriters.
Thus the register "de novo" was given up
to the consul, the men discharged, and paid off according
to the act of William IV., which provides
that each man shall receive a stipend to carry him to
the port in Great Britain from which he shipped, or
the consul to provide passage for him, according to
his inclination, to proceed to a point where the
voyage would be completed. The consul adopted the
best means in his power to make them all comfortable
and satisfied with their discharge. Their several
register-tickets were given up to them, and one by<pb n="250"/>
one left for his place of destination; Tommy and the
second mate only preferring to remain and seek
some new voyage. The old chief mate seemed to
congratulate himself in the condemnation of the unlucky
Janson. He shipped on board an English ship,
laden with cotton and naval stores, and just ready for
sea. When he came on board to take a farewell of the
Captain, he stood upon deck, and looking up at the
dismantled spars, said, "Skipper, a shadow may
save a body after all. I've always had a presentment
that this unlucky old thing would serve us a trick.
I says to meself that night in the Gulf, 'Well, old
craft, yer goin' to turn yer old ribs into a coffin, at
last,' but I'll praise the bridge that carries me safe
over, because I've an affection for the old thing after
all, and can't part without saying God bless her, for
it's an honest death to die in debt to the underwriters.
I hope her old bones will rest in peace on terra-firma.
Good-by, Captain,—remember me to Manuel; and
let us forget our troubles in Charleston by keeping
away from it."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
            <head>GEORGE THE SECESSIONIST, AND HIS FATHER'S SHIPS.</head>
            <p>AS we have said, the second mate and little Tommy
remained to seek new voyages. Such was the fact
with the second mate; but Tommy had contracted a
violent cold on the night he was locked up in the
guard-house, and had been a subject for the medicine-chest
for some time; and this, with his ardent attachment
for Manuel, and hopes to join him again as a
sailing companion, was the chief inducement for his
remaining. The Captain gave them accommodations
in the cabin so long as he had possession of the ship,
which afforded the means of saving their money, of
which Tommy had much need; for notwithstanding
he received a nice present from the consul, and another
from the Captain, which, added to the few
dollars that were coming to him for wages, made him
feel purse-proud, though it was far from being adequate
to sustain him any length of time, or to protect
him against any sudden adversity.</p>
            <p>The Captain had not seen little George, the secessionist,
since his assurance that he would make every
thing right with Mr. Grimshaw, and have Manuel out
in less than twenty-four hours. It was now the fourteenth
of April, and the signs of his getting out were
not so good as they were on the first day he was committed,
for the vessel being condemned, if the law
was carried to the strictest literal construction, Manuel<pb n="252"/>
would be tied up among the human things that are
articles of merchandise in South Carolina. He was
passing from the wharf to the consul's office about ten
o'clock in the morning, when he was suddenly surprised
in the street by little George, who shook his
hand as if he had been an old friend just returned
after a long absence. He made all the apologies in
the world for being called away suddenly, and consequently,
unable to render that attention to his business
which his feelings had prompted. Like all
secessionists, George was very fiery and transitory in
his feelings. He expressed unmeasurable surprise
when the Captain told him the condition of his man
in the old jail. "You don't say that men are restricted
like that in Charleston? Well, now, I never
was in that jail, but it's unsuited to the hospitality of
our society," said he.</p>
            <p>"Your prison groans with abuses, and yet your
people never hear them," replied the Captain.</p>
            <p>George seemed anxious to change the subject, and
commenced giving the Captain a description of his
journey to the plantation, his hunting and fishing,
his enjoyments, and the fat, saucy, slick niggers, the
fine corn and bacon they had, and what they said
about massa, ending with an endless encomium of
the "old man's" old whiskey, and how he ripened it
to give it smoothness and flavor. His description of
the plantation and the niggers was truly wonderful,
tantalizing the Captain's imagination with the beauties
of a growing principality in itself. "We have
just got a new vessel added to our ships, and she sails
for the Pedee this afternoon. We got the right
stripe of a captain, but we have made him adopt conditions
to be true to the secession party. As soon as<pb n="253"/>
I get another man, we'll despatch her in grand style,
and no mistake."</p>
            <p>The Captain thought of his second mate, and suggested
him at once. "Just the chap. My old man
would like him, I know," said George, and they
returned directly to the Janson, where they found
the second mate lashing his dunnage. The proposition
was made and readily accepted. Again the
Captain parted with little George, leaving him to
take the mate to his father's office, while he pursued
his business at the consul's.</p>
            <p>George led the mate into the office. "Here,
father, here's a man to go in our vessel," said he.
The old man looked upon him with a serene importance,
as if he was fettered with his own greatness.</p>
            <p>"My shipping interests are becoming very extensive,
my man; I own the whole of four schooners,
and a share in the greatest steamship afloat—I mean
screw-ship, the <name>South Carolina</name>—you've heard of her,
I suppose?" said the old man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jack</hi> stood up with his hat in his hand, thinking
over what he meant by big interests, and "reckoning
he hadn't seen the establishment of them ship-owners
about Prince's Dock, what owned more ships apiece
than there were days in the month."</p>
            <p>"Now, my man," continued the old man, "I'm
mighty strict about my discipline, for I want every
man to do his duty for the interests of the owners.
But how many dollars do you want a month, my
man?"</p>
            <p>"Nothing less than four pounds starling; that's
twenty dollars your currency, if I reckon right," said
Jack, giving his hat a twirl upon the floor.</p>
            <p>"Wh-e-w! you belong to the independent sailors.<pb n="254"/>
You'll come down from that afore you get a ship in
this port. Why, I can get a good, prime nigger feller
sailor for eight dollars a month and his feed."</p>
            <p>Jack concluded not to sail in any of the old man's
<emph>big ships</emph>, and said, "Yes, I joined them a long time
ago, and I ha'n't regretted it, neither; wouldn't pull
a bow-line a penny less. I don't like drogging, no-how.
Good morning, sir," said he, putting on his
hat. and backing out of the door.</p>
            <p>"I wish you'd a' taken a chance with my father,
old fellow; he'd a' made you captain afore a year,"
said George, as he was leaving the door.</p>
            <p>"The like o' that don't signify. I've been skipper
in the West Ingie trade years ago. There isn't much
difference between a nigger and a schooner's captain,"
said Jack, as he walked off to the Janson, preparatory
to taking lodgings ashore.</p>
            <p>That afternoon about five o'clock, a loud noise was
heard on board a little schooner, of about sixty tons'
register, that lay in a bend of the wharf a few lengths
ahead of the Janson. Captain Thompson and his
second mate were seated on a locker in the cabin,
conversing upon the prospects ahead, when the noise
became so loud that they ran upon deck to witness
the scene.</p>
            <p>George stood upon the capsill of the wharf, with
mortification pictured in his countenance. "Well,
captain, you needn't make so much noise about it;
your conduct is decidedly ungentlemanly. If you
don't wish to sail in father's employ, leave like a gentleman,"
said George, pulling up the corners of his
shirt-collar.</p>
            <p>It was the great craft that George had distended
upon, and the veritable captain of the right stripe,<pb n="255"/>
who promised to toe the mark according to secession
principles, but made no stipulations for the nigger
feed that was the cause of the excitement. The
captain, a Baltimore coaster, and accustomed to good
feed in his vessels at home, had been induced by
a large representations to take charge of the craft and
run her in the Pedee trade, bringing rice to Charleston.
On being told the craft was all ready for
sea, he repaired on board, and, to his chagrin, found
two black men for a crew, and a most ungainly old
wench, seven shades blacker than Egyptian darkness,
for a cook. This was imposition enough to arouse
his feelings, for but one of the men knew any thing
about a vessel; but on examining the stores, the
reader may judge of his feelings, if he have any idea
of supplying a vessel in a Northern port, when we tell
him that all and singular the stores consisted of a
shoulder of rusty Western bacon, a half-bushel of rice,
and a jug of molasses; and this was to proceed the
distance of a hundred miles, But to add to the
ridiculous farce of that South Carolina notion, when
he remonstrated with them, he was very indifferently
told that it was what they always provided for their
<emph>work-people</emph>.</p>
            <p>"Take your' little jebacca-boat and go to thunder
with her," said the captain, commencing to pick up
his duds.</p>
            <p>"Why, captain, I lent you my gun, and we always
expect our captains to make fresh provision of game
as you run up the river," said George.</p>
            <p>"Fresh provisions, the devil!" said the captain.
"I've enough to do to mind my duty, without hunting
my living as I pursue my voyage, like a hungry dog.
We don't do business on your nigger-allowance <orig>sys-</orig>
               <pb n="256"/>
tem in Maryland." And here we leave him, getting
one of the negroes to carry his things back to his
boarding-house.</p>
            <p>A few days after the occurrence we have narrated
above little Tommy, somewhat recovered from his
cold, shipped on board a little centre-board
schooner, called the Three Sisters, bound to the
Edisto River for a cargo of rice. The captain, a
little, stubby man, rather good looking, and well
dressed, was making his maiden voyage <emph>as captain</emph> of
a South Carolina craft. He was "<emph>South Carolina
born</emph>," but, like many others of his kind, had been
forced to seek his advancement in a distant State,
through the influence of those formidable opinions
which exiles the genius of the poor in South Carolina.
For ten years he had sailed out of the port of Boston,
had held the position of mate on two Indian voyages
under the well-known Captain Nott, and had sailed
with Captain Albert Brown, and received his recommendation,
yet this was not enough to qualify
him for the nautical ideas of a pompous South Carolinian.</p>
            <p>Tommy got his baggage on board, and before leaving,
made another attempt at the jail to see his friend
Manuel. He presented himself to the jailer, and
told him how much he wanted to see his old friend
before he left. The jailer's orders were imperative.
He was told if he came next week he would see him;
that he would then be released, and allowed to occupy
the cell on the second floor with the other stewards.
Recognising one of the stewards that had joined with
them when they enjoyed their social feelings around
the festive barrel, he walked into the piazza to meet
him and bid him good-by. While he stood shaking<pb n="257"/>
hands with him, the poor negro<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>The
name of this poor fellow was George Fairchild. After
being sent to the workhouse to receive twenty blows
with the paddle when he was scarcely able to stand, he was taken down
from the frame and supported to the jail, where he remained
several weeks, fed at a cost of eighteen cents a day. His crime
was "going for whiskey at night," and the third offence; but there
were a variety of pleadings in his favor. His master worked his
negroes to the very last tension of their strength, and exposed
their appetites to all sorts of temptation, especially those who
worked in the night-gang. His master flogged him once, while
he was in the jail, himself, giving him about forty stripes with a
raw hide on the bare back: not satisfying his feelings with this,
he concluded to send him to New Orleans. He had an affectionate
wife and child, who were forbidden to see him. His master
ordered that he should be sent to the workhouse and receive thirty-nine
paddles before leaving, and on the morning he was to be
shipped, his distressed wife, hearing the sad news, came to the jail;
but notwithstanding the entreaties of several debtors, the jailer
could not allow her to come in, but granted, as a favor, that she
should speak with him through the grated door. The cries and
lamentations of that poor woman, as she stood upon
the outside, holding her bond-offspring in her arms, taking a last sorrowing
farewell of him who was so dearly cherished and beloved, would
have melted a heart of stone. She could not embrace him, but
waited until he was led out to torture, when she threw her arms
around him, and was dragged away by a ruffian's hand.</p>
                  <p>Poor
George Fairchild! We heard him moaning under the
acute pain of the paddle, and saw him thrust into a cart like a
dog, to be shipped as a bale of merchandise for a distant port.</p>
               </note>
who had suffered
with him in the guard-house came up and saluted him
with a friendly recognition. Some two weeks had
passed since the occurrence, and yet his head presented
the effects of bruising, and was bandaged with
a cloth. "Good young massa, do give me a' fo'
pence, for Is'e mose starve," he said in a suppliant
tone. Tommy put his hand into his pocket, and
drawing out a quarter, passed it to the poor fellow,<pb n="258"/>
and received his thanks. Leaving a message for
Manuel that he would be sure to call and see him
when he returned, he passed from the house of misery
and proceeded to his vessel.</p>
            <p>The captain of the schooner had been engaged by
parties in Charleston, who simply acted as agents for
the owners. He had been moved to return to Charleston
by those feelings which are so inherent in our
nature, inspiring a feeling for the place of its nativity,
and recalling the early associations of childhood.
Each longing fancy pointed back again, and back he
came, to further fortune on his native soil. His crew,
with the exception of Tommy, consisted of three good,
active negroes, one of whom acted as pilot on the
Edisto River. Accustomed to the provisioning of
Boston ships, he had paid no attention to his supplies;
for, in fact, he only took charge of the little craft as
an accommodation to the agents, and with the promise
of a large vessel as soon as he returned; and sailing
with a fine stiff breeze, he was far outside the light
when the <emph>doctor</emph> announced dinner. "What have
you got that's good, old chap?" said he to the cook.</p>
            <p>"Fust stripe, Massa Cap'en. A right good chance
o' homony and bacon fry," returned the negro.</p>
            <p>"Homony and what? Nothing else but that?"</p>
            <p>"Why, massa! gracious, dat what Massa Whaley
give all he cap'en, an' he tink 'em fust-rate," said
the negro.</p>
            <p>As they were the only whites on board, the captain
took little Tommy into the cabin with him to sit at
the same table; but there was too much truth in the
negro's statement, and instead of sitting down to one
of those nice dinners which are spread in Boston
ships, both great and small, there, on a little piece<pb n="259"/>
of pine board, swung with a preventer, was a plate of
black homony covered with a few pieces of fried pork,
so rank and oily as to be really repulsive to a common
stomach. Beside it was an earthen mug, containing
about a pint of molasses, which was bedaubed on the
outside to show its quality. The captain looked at it
for a minute, and then taking up the iron spoon
which stood in it, and letting one or two spoonfuls
drop back, said, "Old daddie, where are all your
stores? Fetch them out here."</p>
            <p>"Gih, massa! here 'em is; 'e's jus' as Massa Stoney
give 'em," said the negro, drawing forth a
piece of rusty and tainted bacon, weighing about
fifteen pounds, and, in spots, perfectly alive with
motion; about a half-bushel of corn-grits; and a
small keg of molasses, with a piece of leather attached
to the bung.</p>
            <p>"Is that all?" inquired the captain peremptorily.</p>
            <p>"Yes, massa, he all w'at 'em got now, but git more
at Massa Whaley plantation win 'em git da."</p>
            <p>"Throw it overboard, such stinking stuff; it'll
breed pestilence on board," said the captain to the
negro, (who stood holding the spoiled bacon in his
hand, with the destructive macalia dropping on the
floor,) at the same time applying his foot to the table,
and making wreck of hog, homony, molasses, and plates.</p>
            <p>"Gih-e-wh-ew! Massa, I trow 'im o'board, Massa
Whaley scratch 'em back, sartin. He tink 'em fust-rate.
Plantation nigger on'y gits bacon twice week,
Massa Cap'en," said he, picking up the wreck and
carrying it upon deck, where it was devoured with
great gusto by the negroes, who fully appreciated the
happy God-send.</p>
            <pb n="260"/>
            <p>The captain had provided a little private store of crackers, cheese,
segars, and a bottle of brandy, and turning to his trunk, he opened it and
drew them out one by one, passing the crackers and cheese to
Tommy, and imbibing a little of the deacon himself, thus satisfying
the cravings of nature. Night came on; they were crossing the bar and
approaching the outlet of the Edisto, which was broad in sight; but
there was neither coffee. nor tea on board, and no prospect of
supper—nothing but a resort to the crackers and cheese remained, the stock
of which had already diminished so fast, that what was left
was treasured among the things too choice to be eaten without limitation.
They reached the entrance, and after ascending a few miles, came to anchor
under a jut of wood that formed a bend in the river. The baying of dogs
during the night intimated the vicinity of a settlement near, and in the
morning the captain sent one of the negroes on shore for a bottle of milk.
"Massa, dat man what live yonder ha'n't much no-how, alwa's makes 'em pay
seven-pence," said the negro. Sure enough it was true; notwithstanding he
was a planter of some property, he made the smallest things turn to profit,
and would charge vessels going up the river twelve and a half cents per
bottle for milk.</p>
            <p>The captain had spent a restless night, and found himself blotched with
innumerable chinch-bites; and on examining the berths and lockers, he found
them swarming in piles. Calling one of the black men, he commenced
overhauling them, and drew out a perfect storehouse of rubbish, which must
have been deposited there, without molestation, from the day the vessel was
launched up to the present time, as varied in its<pb n="261"/>
kinds as the stock of a Jew-shop, and rotten with age. About nine o'clock
they got under weigh again, and proceeding about twenty miles with a fair
wind and tide, they came to another point in the river, on which a
concourse of men had assembled, armed to the teeth with guns, rifles, and
knives. As he passed up, they were holding parley with a man and boy in a
canoe a few rods from the shore. At every few minutes they would point
their rifles at him, and with threatening gestures, swear vengeance
against him if he attempted to land. The captain, being excited by the
precarious situation of the man and his boy, and anxious to ascertain the
particulars, let go his anchor and "came to" a few lengths above.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had his anchor brought up than he was hailed from the shore by
a rough-looking man, who appeared to be chief in the manœuvre, and
who proved to be no less a personage than a Mr. S——k, a wealthy
planter.</p>
            <p>"Don't take that man on board of your vessel, at the peril of your life,
captain. He's an abolitionist," said he, accompanying his imperative
command with a very Southern rotation of oaths.</p>
            <p>The man paddled his canoe on the outside of the vessel, and begged the
captain "for God's sake to take him on board and protect him; that an
excitement had been gotten up against him very unjustly, and he
would explain the circumstances if he would allow him to come on
board."</p>
            <p>"Come on board," said the captain. "Let you be abolitionist or what you
will, humanity will not let me see you driven out to sea in that manner;
you would be swamped before you crossed the bar."</p>
            <p>He came on board, trembling and wet, the little<pb n="262"/>
boy handing up a couple of carpet-bags, and following him. No sooner had he
done so, than three or four balls whizzed past the captain's head, causing
him to retreat to the cabin. A few minutes intervened, and he returned to
the deck.</p>
            <p>"Lower your boat and come on shore immediately," they cried out.</p>
            <p>The captain, not at all daunted, lowered his boat and went on shore.
"Now, gentlemen, what do you want with me?" said he, when S—-k stepped
forward, and the following dialogue ensued:—</p>
            <p>"Who owns that vessel, and what right have you to harbor a d——d
abolitionist?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know who owns the vessel; I know that I sail her, and the laws
of God and man demand that I shall not pass a man in distress, especially
upon the water. He protests that he is not, and never was an abolitionist;
offers to prove it if you will hear him, and only asks that you allow him
to take away his property," rejoined the captain.</p>
            <p>"What! then you are an abolitionist yourself?"</p>
            <p>"No, sir. I'm a Southern-born man, raised in Charleston, where my father
was raised before me."</p>
            <p>"So much, so good; but just turn that d——d scoundrel ashore as quick
as seventy, or we'll tie your vessel up and report you to the Executive
Committee, and stop your getting on more freight on the Edisto."</p>
            <p>"That I shall not do. You should have patience to investigate these
things, and not allow your feelings to become so excited. If I turn him and
his son adrift, I'm answerable for their lives if any accident should
occur to them," rejoined the captain.</p>
            <p>"Are you a secessionist, captain, or what are your political principles?
You seem determined to protect<pb n="263"/>
abolitionists. That scoundrel has been associating with a nigger, and
eating at his house ever since he has been here."</p>
            <p>"Yes, yes, and we'll be d——d if he isn't an abolitionist," joined in a
dozen voices, "for he dined at Bill Webster's last Sunday on a wild-turkey.
Nobody but an infernal abolitionist would dine with a nigger."</p>
            <p>"As for politics, I never had much to do with them, and care as little
about secession as I do about theology; but I like to see men act
reasonably. If you want any thing more of me, you will find me at
Colonel Whaley's plantation to-morrow." Thus saying, he stepped into his
boat and returned on board of his vessel. Just as he was getting
under-weigh again, whiz! whiz! whiz! came three shots, one in quick
succession after the other, the last taking effect and piercing the crown
of his hat, at which they retired out of sight. Fearing a return, he worked
his vessel about two miles farther up and came to anchor on the other side
of the channel, where he waited the return of the tide, and had an
opportunity to put his affrighted passengers on board a schooner that was
passing down, bound to Charleston.</p>
            <p>The secret of such an outrage is told in a few words. The man was a
timber-getter from the vicinity of New Bedford, Massachusetts, who, with
his son, a lad about sixteen years of age, had spent several
winters in the vicinity of the Edisto, getting live-oak, what he considered
a laudable enterprise. He purchased the timber on the stump of the
inhabitants, at a price which left him very little profit, and had
also been charged an exorbitant price for every thing he got, whether labor
or provisions; and so far had that<pb n="264"/>
feeling of South Carolina's self-sufficiency been carried out against
him in all its cold repulsiveness, that he found much more honesty and true
hospitality under the roof of a poor colored man. This so enraged
some of the planters, that they proclaimed against him, and that
<emph>mad-dog</emph> cry of abolitionist was raised against him. His horse
and buggy, books and papers were packed up and sent to Charleston—not,
however, without some of the most important of the latter being lost. His
business was destroyed, and he and his child taken by force, put into a
little canoe with one or two carpet-bags, and sent adrift. In this manner
they had followed him two miles down the river, he begging to be allowed
the privilege of settling his business and leave respectably—they
threatening to shoot him if he attempted to near the shore, or was caught
in the vicinity. This was his position when the captain found him. He
proceeded to Charleston, and laid his case before James L. Petigru, Esq.,
United States District Attorney, and, upon his advice, returned to the
scene of "war on the banks of the Edisto," to arrange his business; but no
sooner had he made his appearance than he was thrown into prison, and there
remained when we last heard of him.</p>
            <p>This is one of the many cases which afford matter for exciting comment
for the editors of the Charleston Mercury and the Courier, and which
reflect no honor on a people who thus set law and order at
defiance.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
            <head type="sub">A SINGULAR RECEPTION.</head>
            <p>IT was about ten o'clock on the night of the fifteenth of April when the
schooner "Three Sisters" lay anchored close alongside of a dark jungle of
clustering brakes that hung their luxuriant foliage upon the
bosom of the stream. The captain sat upon a little box near the quarter,
apparently contemplating the scene, for there was a fairy-like beauty in
its dark windings, mellowed by the shadowing foliage that
skirted its borders in mournful grandeur, while stars twinkled on the
sombre surface.</p>
            <p>The tide had just turned, and little Tommy, who had rolled himself up
in a blanket and laid down close to the captain, suddenly arose. "Captain,
did you hear that?" said he.</p>
            <p>"Hark! there it is again," said the captain. "Go and call the men,—we
must get under weigh."</p>
            <p>It was a rustling noise among the brakes; and when little Tommy went
forward to call the men, two balls came whistling over the quarter, and
then a loud rustling noise indicated that persons were retreating. The
captain retired to the cabin and took Tommy with him, giving orders to
the negro pilot to stand to the deck, get her anchor up, and let her
drift up stream with the tide, determined that if they shot any person,
it should be the negroes, for whose value they would be held answerable.
Thus she drifted up<pb n="266"/>
the stream, and the next morning was at the creek at
Colonel Whaley's plantation.</p>
            <p>A number of ragged negroes came down to the
bank in high glee at the arrival, and making sundry
inquiries about corn and bacon. One old patriarchal
subject cried out to the pilot, "Ah, Cesar, I 'now'd
ye wah cumin'. Massa, an' young Massa Aleck, bin
promis' bacon mor' den week, gess he cum' now."</p>
            <p>"Got sum corn, but ven ye gets bacon out o' dis
craf' ye kotch wesel, dat a'n't got no hair on 'im,"
said Cesar.</p>
            <p>The scene around was any thing but promising—disappointing
to the captain's exalted ideas of Colonel
Whaley's magnificent plantation. The old farm-house
was a barrack-like building, dilapidated, and showing
no signs of having lately furnished a job for the
painter, and standing in an arena surrounded by an
enclosure of rough slats. Close examination disclosed
fragments of gardening in the arena, but they showed
the unmistakable evidences of carelessness. At a
short distance from this was a cluster of dirty-looking
negro-huts, raised a few feet from the ground on palmetto
piles, and strung along from them to the brink
of the river were numerous half-starved cattle and
hogs, the latter rooting up the sod.</p>
            <p>It was now nearly slack water, on a high flood, and
the schooner lay just above the bend of the creek.
Presently a large, portly-looking man, dressed like as
Yorkshire farmer, came, to the bank, and in a stentorious
voice ordered the captain to haul into the
creek at once! The manner in which the order
was given rather taxed the captain's feelings, yet he
immediately set his men to work heaving up the
anchor and carrying out "a line" to warp her in.<pb n="267"/>
But that slow motion with which negroes execute all
orders, caused some delay, and no sooner had he,
begun to heave on the line than the tide set strong
ebb and carried him upon the lower point, where a
strong eddy, made by the receding water from the
creek, and the strong undertow in the river, baffled
all his exertions. There she stuck, and all the
warps and tow-lines of a seventy-four, hove by the
combined strength of the plantation, would not have
started her. When the tide left, she careened over
toward the river, for there was no means at hand to
shore her up.</p>
            <p>One of the drivers went up and reported "Massa
captain got 'im ship ashore," and down came Colonel
Whaley, with all the pomp of seven lord mayors in
his countenance. "What sort of a feller are you to
command a ship? I'd whip the worst nigger on the
plantation, if he couldn't do better than that. Rig a
raft out and let me come o' board that vessel!" said
he, accompanying his demands with a volley of vile
imprecations that would have disgraced <hi>St. Giles'</hi>.</p>
            <p>"Do you know who you're talking to? You mus'n't
take me for a nigger, sir! I know my duty, if you
don't good manners," rejoined the captain.</p>
            <p>"Do you know who owns that ship? you impudent
feller, you! Take the sails off her, immediately—at
once! or I'll shoot you, by heavens!" he bawled out
again.</p>
            <p>"Why didn't you say mud-scow? Call such a
thing as this a ship? I don't care who owns her, I
only know it's a disgrace to sail her; but I've got the
papers, and you may help yourself. When you pay
me for my time, and give me something for myself
and these men to eat, you may take your old <orig>jebac-</orig>
               <pb n="268"/>
car-boat,—but you don't put a foot aboard her till
you do!"</p>
            <p>This made the colonel rage worse. "I'll teach
you a lesson how you disobey my orders. Go get
my rifle, Zeke," said the colonel, turning to an old
negro who stood close by. And then calling to the
men on board, he ordered them to take charge of the
vessel and take the sails off her at once.</p>
            <p>"Don't you move a hand to unbend a sail, Cesar!
I don't know that man ashore there. This vessel is
mine until further orders from the persons who shipped me,"
rejoined the captain with an imperative
demand to his men.</p>
            <p>"Why, la! massa, he own em dis ere vessel, an'
he shoot em sartin if we done do him; ye done know
dat massa, as I does," said Cesar.</p>
            <p>"Don't touch a hand to those sails, I command
one and all of you. There's two can play at shooting,
and I'll shoot you if you disobey my orders."
Then turning to those on shore, he warned them that
he would shoot the first nigger that attempted to
make a raft to come on board. The reader will observe
that the poor negroes were in a worse dilemma
than the captain; goaded on the one side by a ruthless
master, who claims ownership and demands the
execution of his orders, while on the other extreme
the hired master proclaims his right, and warns them
against the peril of varying one iota from his commands.
Here the clashing feelings of arbitrary men
come together, which have placed many a good negro
in that complex position, that he would be punished
by one master for doing that which he would have
been punished by the other if he had left undone.</p>
            <p>It may be said to the colonel's credit, he did not<pb n="269"/>
return, rifle in hand, nor did the captain see him
afterward; but a young gentleman, a son, who represented
the father, came to the bank about an hour
after the occurrence, and making a lame apology for
his father's temper, requested the captain to come on
shore. The latter had concluded to await the return
of the tide, run the vessel back to Charleston, report
his reception, and deliver the vessel up to the agents;
but on further consideration, there was nothing to
eat on board, and what could he do? He went on
shore, and held a parley with the young man, whom
he found much more inclined to respect <emph>his color</emph>.
"Your father took me for a nigger, and as such he
presumed upon the dignity of his plantation. Now
I know my duty, and have sailed in the finest ships
and with the best masters in the country. All I want
is proper respect, something to eat, what there is
coming to me, and my passage paid back to Charleston
by land. No! I will not even request so much
as that; give me something to eat, and my passage
to Charleston, and you may do what you please with
the vessel, but I shall deliver the papers to nobody
but the persons who shipped me. And I shall want
you to see this little boy attended to, for he's quite
sick now," said the captain, pointing to Tommy, and
calling him to him.</p>
            <p>"Oh yes," replied the young man, "we'll take
care of the little fellow, and see him sent safely
back," and took leave, promising to have another
interview in the afternoon. About twelve o'clock a
negro boy came to the vessel with a tin pan covered
with a towel, and presenting it to Cesar, for "massa
cap'en and buckra boy." Cesar brought it aft and
set it upon the companion. It contained some rice,<pb n="270"/>
a piece of bacon, corn-cake, and three sweet-potatoes.</p>
            <p>"Coarse fare, but I can get along with it. Come
Tommy, I guess you're hungry, as well as myself,"
said the captain, and they sat down, and soon demolished
the feast of Southern hospitality. About five
o'clock in the evening, the young man not making
his appearance, the Captain sent Tommy ashore to
inquire for him at the house, telling him (in order to
test their feelings) that he could stop and get his
supper. Tommy clambered ashore, and up the bank
wending his way to the house. The young man
made his appearance, offering an apology for his
delay and inattention, saying the presence of some
very particular friends from Beaufort was the cause.
"My father, you are aware, owns this vessel,
captain!—You got a good dinner, to-day, by-the-by,"
said he.</p>
            <p>"Yes, we got along with it, but could have eaten
more," rejoined the captain.</p>
            <p>"Ah! bless me, that was the nigger's fault. These
niggers are such uncertain creatures, you must watch
'em over the least thing. Well now, captain, my
father has sent you five dollars to pay your passage
to Charleston!"</p>
            <p>"Well, that's a small amount, but I'll try and get
along with it, rather than stop here, at any rate," said
the captain, taking the bill and twisting it into his
pocket, and giving particular charges in regard to
taking care of the boy. That night, a little after
sundown, he took passage in a downward-bound
coaster, bid a long good-by to the Edisto and
Colonel Whaley's plantation, and arrived in Charleston
the next night. On the following morning he<pb n="271"/>
presented himself to the agents, who generously paid
him, all his demands, and expressed their regrets at
the circumstance. Acting upon the smart of feeling,
the captain enclosed the five-dollar bill and returned
it to the sovereign Colonel Whaley.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>The
Savannah Republican, of the 11th September, says—"We
have been kindly furnished with the particulars of a duel which
came off at Major Stark's plantation, opposite this city, yesterday
morning, between Colonel E. M. Whaley, and E. E. Jenkins,
of South Carolina." Another paper stated that "after a single
exchange of shot, * * * * the affair terminated, but without a
reconciliation." The same Colonel Whaley! Either 'of these
journals might have give particulars more grievous, and equally
as expressive of Southern life. They might have described a
beautiful wife, a Northern lady, fleeing with her two children, to
escape the abuses of a faithless husband—taking shelter in the
Charleston Hotel, and befriended by Mr. Jenkins and another
young man, whose name we shall not mention—and that famous
establishment surrounded by the police on a Sabbath night, to
guard its entrances—and she dragged forth, and carried back to
the home of unhappiness.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE HABEAS CORPUS.</head>
            <p>THE Captain of the Janson had settled his business,
and was anxious to return home. He had done
all in his power for Manuel, and notwithstanding the
able exertions of the consul were combined with his,
he had effected nothing to relieve him. The law was
imperative, and if followed out, there was no <orig>alterna-</orig>
               <pb n="272"/>
tive for him, except upon the ground of his proving
himself entitled to a white man's privileges. To do
this would require an endless routine of law, which
would increase his anxiety and suffering twofold.
Mr. Grimshaw had been heard to say, that if an
habeas corpus were sued out, he should stand upon
the technicality of an act of the legislature, refuse to
answer the summons or give the man up. No, he
would himself stand the test upon the point of right
to the habeas corpus, and if he was committed for
refusing to deliver up the prisoner, he would take
advantage of another act of the legislature, and
after remaining a length of time in jail, demand his
release according to the statutes. So far was Mr.
Grimshaw impressed with his own important position
in the matter, and of the course which he should
pursue, that he several times told the prisoners that
he should be a prisoner among them in a few days, to
partake of the same fare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge Withers</hi>, however, saved him the necessity
of such important trouble. To those acquainted
with <hi>Judge Withers</hi> it would be needless to dwell
upon the traits of his character. To those who are
not, we can say that his were feelings founded upon
interest—moving in the foremost elements of
secession—arbitrary, self-willed, and easily swayed by
prejudice—a man known to the public and the bar
for his frigidity, bound in his own opinions, and
yielding second to the wishes and principles of
none—fearful of his popularity as a judge, yet devoid of
those sterling principles which deep jurists bring to
their aid when considering important questions, where
life or liberty is at stake—a mind that would
rather reinstate monarchy than spread the blessings of<pb n="273"/>
a free government. What ground have we here to
hope for a favorable issue?</p>
            <p>Thus when the consul applied for the writ of
habeas corpus, the right was denied him,
notwithstanding the subject was heir-inherent to all the
rights of citizenship and protection, which the laws
of his own nation could clothe him with. To show
how this matter was treated by the press—though we
are happy to say the feelings of the mercantile
community are not reflected in it—we copy the leader
from the "<title>Southern Standard</title>," a journal published
in Charleston, the editor of which professes to represent
the conservative views of a diminutive minority.

                     <p>" Our readers have not forgotten the correspondence
which some time since took place between His
Excellency Governor Means and Her British Majesty's
Consul, Mr. Mathew. We published in the <title>Standard</title>,
of the 5th December last, the very temperate, dignified,
and well-argued report of Mr. Mazyck, chairman
of the special committee of the Senate, to whom
had been referred the message of the Governor,
transmitting the correspondence. In our issue of
the 16th December, we gave to our readers the able
report of Mr. McCready, on behalf of the committee
of the other house, on the same subject.</p>
                     <p>"We have now to call the attention of the public
to the fact, that the practical issue has been made,
by which the validity of the laws in regard to colored
seamen arriving in our port is to be submitted to<pb n="274"/>
the judicial tribunals of the country. For ourselves
we have no fears for the credit of the State in such
a controversy. The right of the State to control, by
her own legislation, the whole subject-matter, can, as
we think, by a full discussion, be established upon a
basis which, in the South at least, will never hereafter
be questioned. If there be defects in the details
of the regulations enacted, the consideration of
them is now precluded, when the issue presented is
the right of the State to act at all times in the
premises.</p>
                     <p>"The writ of habeas corpus was applied for before
Judge Withers, during the term of the court which
has just closed, by the British consul, through his
counsel, Mr. Petigru, in behalf of one Manuel
Pereira, a colored sailor, who claims to be a Portuguese
subject, articled to service on board an English
brig driven into this port by stress of weather; the
said Manuel Pereira being then in jail under the provisions
of the act of the legislature of this State,
passed in 1835, emendatory of the previous acts on
the subject. Judge Withers, in compliance with the
requirements of the act of 1844, refused the writ of
habeas corpus, and notice of appeal has been given.
Thus is the issue upon us.</p>
                     <p>"We have but one regret in the matter, and that
is that the case made is one where the party asking
his liberty has been driven into our harbor involuntarily.
Great Britain, it is true, is the last power
which should complain on this account, with her
own example in the case of the <name>Enterprise</name> before
her eyes; but we do not, we confess, like this feature
of the law. We have no doubt, however, that this
fact being brought to the notice of the executive, he<pb n="275"/>
will interfere promptly to release the individual in
the present case, provided the party petitions for the
purpose, and engages at once to leave the State.
But we shall see nothing of this. Mr. Manuel Pereira,
like another John Wilkes, is to have settled in
his person great questions of constitutional liberty.
The posterity which in after times shall read of his
voluntary martyrdom and heroic self-sacrifice in the
cause of suffering humanity, must be somewhat better
informed than Mr. Pereira himself; for we observe
that his clerkly skill did not reach the point of enabling
him to subscribe his name to the petition for
habeas corpus, which is to figure so conspicuously in
future history, it being more primitively witnessed by
his '<emph>mark</emph>.'"</p>
                  </div>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>An appeal was taken from this refusal, and carried
before the appeal court, sitting at Columbia, the
capital of the State. How was this treated? Without
enlisting common respect, it sustained the opinion
of Judge Withers, who was one of its constituted
members. Under such a state of things, where all
the avenues to right and justice were clogged by a
popular will that set itself above law or justice,
where is the unprejudiced mind that will charge improper
motives in asking justice of the highest judicial
tribunal in the country.</p>
            <p>In the year 1445, a petition was presented, or
entered on the rolls of the British Parliament, from
the commons of two neighboring counties, praying
the abatement of a nuisance which promised fearful
interruptions to the peace and quiet of their hamlets,
in consequence of the number of attorneys having
increased from eight to twenty-four, setting forth
that attorneys were dangerous to the peace and <orig>hap-</orig>
               <pb n="276"/>
piness of a community, and praying that there should
be no more than six attorneys for each county. The
king granted the petition, adding a clause which left
it subject to the approval of the judges. Time
works mighty contrasts. If those peaceable old
commoners could have seen a picture of the nineteenth
century, with its judiciary dotted upon the
surface, they would certainly have put the world
down as a very unhappy place. The people of
Charleston might now inquire why they have so
much law and so little justice?</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE CAPTAIN'S DEPARTURE AND MANUEL'S RELEASE.</head>
            <p>AFTER remaining nearly three weeks in close confinement
in a cell on the third story, Manuel was
allowed to come down and resume his position among
the stewards, in the "steward's cell." There was a
sad change of faces. But one of those he left was
there; and he, poor fellow, was so changed as to be
but a wreck of what he was when Manuel was confined
in the cell.</p>
            <p>After little Tommy left, the Captain deposited a
sum of money with the jailer to supply Manuel's
wants. The jailer performed his duty faithfully, but
the fund was soon exhausted, and Manuel was forced
to appeal to his consul. With the care for its citizens
that marks the course of that government, and the characteristic
kindness of its representative in <orig>Charles-</orig>
               <pb n="277"/>
ton, the appeal was promptly responded to. The
consul attended him in person, and even provided
from his own purse things necessary to make him comfortable.
We could not but admire the nobleness of
many acts bestowed upon this humble citizen through
the consul, showing the attachment and faith of a
government to its humblest subject. The question
now was, would the Executive release him? Mr.
Grimshaw had interposed strong objections, and made
unwarrantable statements in regard to his having
been abandoned by his captain, the heavy expenses
incurred to maintain the man, and questioning the
validity of the British consul's right to protect him.
Under the effect of these representations, the prospect
began to darken, and Manuel became more discontented,
and anxiously awaited the result.</p>
            <p>In this position, a petition was despatched to the
Executive, asking that the man might be released, on
the faith of the British Government that all expenses
be paid, and he immediately sent beyond the limits
of the State.</p>
            <p>But we must return and take leave of Captain
Thompson, before we receive the answer to the petition.
The day fixed for his departure had arrived.
He had all his papers collected, and arose early to
take his accustomed walk through the market. It was
a little after seven o'clock, and as he approached the
singular piece of wood-work that we have described
in a previous chapter as the Charleston Whipping-post,
he saw a crowd collected around it, and negroes running
to the scene, crying out, "<emph>Buckra gwine to get
whip! buckra get 'e back scratch!</emph>" &amp;c. &amp;c. He
quickened his pace, and, arriving at the scene, elbowed
his way through an immense crowd until he came to<pb n="278"/>
where he had a fair view. Here, exposed to view,
were six respectably dressed white men, to be whipped
according to the laws of South Carolina, which flog
in the market for petty theft. Five of them were
chained together, and the other scientifically secured
to the machine, with his bare back exposed, and Mr.
Grimshaw (dressed with his hat and sword of office to
make the dignity of the punishment appropriate) laying
on the stripes with a big whip, and raising on
tip-toe at each blow to add force, making the flesh
follow the lash. Standing around were about a dozen
huge constables with long-pointed tipstaffs in their
hands, while two others assisted in chaining and unchaining
the prisoners. The spectacle was a barbarous
one, opening a wide field for reflection. It was
said that this barbarous mode of punishment was kept
up as an example for the negroes. It certainly is a
very singular mode of inspiring respect for the laws.</p>
            <p>He had heard much of T. Norman Gadsden, whose
fame sounded for being the greatest negro-seller in
the country, yet he had not seen him, though he
had witnessed several negro-sales at other places.
On looking over the papers after breakfast, his eye
caught a flaming advertisement with "T. Norman
Gadsden's sale of negroes" at the head. There were
plantation negroes, coachmen, house-servants, mechanics,
children of all ages, with descriptions as
various as the kinds. Below the rest, and set out
with a glowing delineation, was a description of a
remarkably fine young sempstress, very bright and
very intelligent, sold for no fault. The notice should
have added an <emph>exception</emph>, that the owner was going to
<emph>get</emph> married.</p>
            <p>He repaired to the place at the time designated,<pb n="279"/>
and found them selling an old plantation-negro, dressed
in ragged, gray clothes, who, after a few bids, was
knocked down for three hundred and fifty dollars.
"We will give tip-top titles to everything we sell
here to-day; and, gentlemen, we shall now offer you
the prettiest wench in town. She is too well-known
for me to say more," said the notorious auctioneer.</p>
            <p>A number of the first citizens were present, and
among them the Captain recognised Colonel S——,
who approached and began to descant upon the sale
of the woman. "It's a d——d shame to sell that
girl, and that fellow ought to be hung up," said he,
meaning the owner; and upon this he commenced
giving a history of the poor girl.</p>
            <p>"Where is she? Bring her along! Lord! gentlemen,
her very curls are enough to start a bid of fifteen
hundred," said the auctioneer.</p>
            <p>"Go it, Gadsden, you're a trump," rejoined a number
of voices.</p>
            <p>The poor girl moved to the stand, pale and trembling,
as if she was stepping upon the scaffold, and
saw her executioners around her. She was very fair
and beautiful—there was something even in her graceful
motions that enlisted admiration. Here she stood
almost motionless for a few moments.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, I ought to charge all of you sevenpence
a sight for looking at her," said the auctioneer.
She smiled at the remark, but it was the smile of
pain.</p>
            <p>"Why don't you sell the girl, and not be dogging
her feelings in this manner?" said Colonel S——.</p>
            <p>Bids continued in rapid succession from eleven
hundred up to thirteen hundred and forty. A well-known
trader from New Orleans stood behind one of<pb n="280"/>
the city brokers, motioning him at every bid, and she
was knocked down to him. We learned her history
and know the sequel.</p>
            <p>The Captain watched her with mingled feelings,
and would fain have said, "Good God! and why art
thou a slave?"</p>
            <p>The history of that unfortunate beauty may be
comprehended in a few words, leaving the reader to
draw the details from his imagination. Her mother
was a fine mulatto slave, with about a quarter Indian
blood. She was the mistress of a celebrated gentleman
in Charleston, who ranked among the first families,
to whom she bore three beautiful children, the
second of which is the one before us. Her father,
although he could not acknowledge her, prized her
highly, and unquestionably never intended that she
should be considered a slave. Alice, for such was
her name, felt the shame of her position. She knew
her father, and was proud to descant upon his honor
and rank, yet must either associate with negroes or
<emph>nobody</emph>, for it would be the death of <emph>caste</emph> for a white
woman, however mean, to associate with her. At the
age of sixteen she became attached to a young gentleman
of high standing but moderate means, and
lived with him as his mistress. Her father, whose
death is well known, died suddenly away from home.
On administering on his estate, it proved that instead
of being wealthy, as was supposed, he was insolvent,
and the creditors insisting upon the children being
sold. Alice was purchased by compromise with the
administrator, and retained by her lord under a mortgage,
the interest and <emph>premium</emph> on which he had
regularly paid for more than four years. Now that
he was about to get married, the excuse of the <orig>mort-</orig>
               <pb n="281"/>
gage was the best pretext in the world to get rid of
her.</p>
            <p>The Captain turned from the scene with feelings
that left deep impressions upon his mind, and that
afternoon took his departure for his Scottish home.</p>
            <p>Time passed heavily at the jail, and day after day
Manuel awaited his fate with anxiety. At every tap
of the prison-bell he would spring to the door and
listen, asserting that he heard the consul's voice in
every passing sound. Day after day the consul would
call upon him and quiet his fears, reassuring him that
he was safe and should not be sold as a slave. At
length, on the seventeenth day of May, after nearly
two months' imprisonment, the glad news was received
that Manuel Pereira was not to be sold, according
to the statutes, but to be released upon payment of
all costs, &amp;c. &amp;c., and immediately sent beyond the
limits of the State. We leave it to the reader's fancy,
to picture the scene of joy on the reception of the
news in the "stewards' cell."</p>
            <p>The consul lost no time in arranging his affairs for
him, and at five o'clock on the afternoon of the 17th
of May, 1852, Manuel Pereira, a poor, shipwrecked
mariner, who, by the dispensation of an all-wise Providence,
was cast upon the shores of South Carolina,
and imprisoned because hospitality to him was "<emph>contrary
to law</emph>," was led forth, pale and emaciated, by
two constables, thrust into a closely covered vehicle,
and driven at full speed to the steamboat then awaiting
to depart for New York. This is but a faint
glimpse, of the suffering to which colored stewards
are subjected in the Charleston jail.<note n="*" place="foot" anchored="true">
                  <p>There
were no less than sixty-three cases of colored seamen
imprisoned on this charge of "contrary to law," during the calendar
year ending on the twelfth of September, 1852. And now that
abuses had become so glaring, a few gentlemen made a representation
of the wretched prison regimen to his Excellency, Governor
Means, who, as if just awoke from a dream that had lasted a generation,
addressed a letter to the Attorney-General, dated on the
seventh of September, 1852, requesting a statement in regard to
the jail—how many prisoners there were confined on the twelfth
day of September, under sentence and awaiting trial, the nature
of offences, who committed by, and how long they had awaited
trial; what the cost of the jail was, how much was paid by prisoners,
and how much by the State, &amp;c. &amp;c. In that statement,
the number of colored seamen was, for reasons best known to Mr.
Grimshaw, kept out of the statement; so also was the difference
between thirty cents and eight cents a day, paid for the ration
for each man. The real statement showed a bounty to the sheriff
of fourteen hundred and sixty-three dollars on' the provisions
alone—a sad premium upon misery. Now add to this a medium
amount for each of these sixty-three sailors, and we have between
eight and nine hundred dollars more, which, with sundry jail-fees
and other cribbage-money, makes the Charleston jail a nice little
appendage to the sheriff's office, and will fully account for the
tenacity with which those functionaries cling to the "old system."</p>

            <p>Now, notwithstanding that high-sounding clamor
about the laws of South Carolina, which every South
Carolinian, in the redundance of his feelings, strives
to impress you with the sovereignty of its justice, its
sacred rights, and its pre-eminent reputation, we
never were in a country or community where the privileges
of a certain class were so much abused. Every
thing is made to conserve popular favor, giving to
those in influence power to do what they please with
a destitute class, whether they be white or black.
Official departments are turned into depots for miserable
espionage, where the most unjust schemes are
practised upon those whose voices cannot be heard in
their own defence. A magistrate is clothed with, or
assumes a power that is almost absolute, committing
them without a hearing, and leaving them to waste
in jail; then releasing them before the court sits,
and charging the fees to the State; or releasing the
poor prisoner on receiving "black mail" for the
kindness; giving one man a peace-warrant to oppress
another whom he knows cannot get bail; and where
a man has served out the penalty of the crime for
which he was committed, give a peace-warrant to his
adversary that he may continue to vent his spleen
upon him. In this manner, we have known a man
who had served seven months' imprisonment for <orig>as-</orig>
               <pb n="284"/>
sault and battery, by an understanding between the
magistrate and the plaintiff, continued in jail for
several years upon a peace-warrant, issued by the
magistrate from time to time, until at length he shot
himself in jail. The man was a peaceable man, and
of a social temperament. He had been offered the
alternative of leaving the State, but he scorned to
accept it. To show that we are correct in what we
say respecting some of the Charleston officials, we
insert an article which appeared in the Charleston
Courier of Sept. 1, 1852:—</p>
            <floatingText type="part">
               <body>
                  <div type="part" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <head>[For the Courier.]</head>
                     <p>"Many of the quiet and moral portion of our community
can form no adequate conception of the extent
to which those who sell liquor, and otherwise trade
with our slaves, are now plying their illegal and demoralizing
traffic. At no period within our recollection
has it prevailed to such an alarming extent; at
no period has its influence upon our slave population
been more palpable or more dangerous; at no period
has the municipal administration been so wilfully
blind to these corrupt practices, or so lenient and forgiving
when such practices are exposed. *  *  *  *</p>
                     <p>"We have heard it intimated that when General
Schnierle is a candidate for the mayoralty, they are
regularly assessed for means to defray the expenses
of the canvass. Instances are not wanting where
amounts of money are paid monthly to General
Schnierle's police as a reward for shutting their eyes
and closing their lips when unlawful proceedings are
in progress. We have at this moment in our possession
a certificate from a citizen, sworn to before Mr.
Giles, the magistrate, declaring that he, the deponent,<pb n="285"/>
heard one of the city police-officers (Sharlock) make
a demand for money upon one of these shop-keepers,
and promised that if he would pay him five dollars
at stated intervals, 'none of the police-officers would
trouble him.' This affidavit can be seen, if inquired
for, at this office. Thus bribery is added to guilt,
and those who should enforce the laws are made
auxiliaries in their violation. Said one of these
slave-destroyers to us, 'General Schnierle suits us
very well. I have no trouble with General Schnierle'—-remarks
at once repugnant and suggestive. *  *  *
We are told by one, that Mr. Hutchinson, when in
power, fined him heavily (and, as he thought, unjustly)
for selling liquor to a slave; hence he would not vote
for him. An additional reason for this animosity
toward Mr. Hutchinson arises from the fact that the
names of offenders were always published during
that gentleman's administration, while under that of
General Schnierle they are screened from public view.
On any Sunday evening, light may be seen in the
shops of these dealers. If the passer-by will for a
few moments stay his course, he will witness the
ingress and egress of negroes; if he approach the
door, he will hear noise as of card-playing and revelry
within. And this is carried on unblushingly; is not
confined to a shop here and a shop there, but may be observed
throughout the city. The writer of this article,
some Sundays since, witnessed from his upper window
a scene of revelry and gambling in one of these
drinking-shops, which will scarcely be credited. A
party of negroes were seen around a card-table, with
money beside them, engaged in betting; glasses of
liquor were on the table, from which they ever and
anon regaled themselves with all the nonchalance<pb n="286"/>
and affected mannerism of the most fashionable
blades of the beau monde.</p>
                     <p>"This may not be a 'desecration of the Sabbath'
by the municipal authorities themselves, but they are
assuredly responsible for its profanation. Appointed
to guard the public morals, they are assuredly censurable
if licentiousness is suffered to run its wild
career unnoticed and unchecked. We do not ask to
be believed. We would prefer to have skeptical
rather than credulous readers. We should prefer
that all would arise from the perusal of this article
in doubt, and determine to examine for themselves.
We believe in the strength and sufficiency of ocular
proof, and court investigation. *  *  *</p>
                     <p>"We are abundantly repaid if we succeed in arousing
public attention to the alarming and dangerous
condition of our city. *  *  *  Let inquiry be
entered into. We boldly challenge it. It will lead
to other and more astonishing developments than
those we have revealed.</p>

            <head type="sub">MANUEL'S ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK.</head>
            <p>WHEN we left Manuel, he was being hurried on
board the steamship, as if he was a bale of infected
goods. Through the kindness of the clerk in the
consul's office, he was provided with a little box of
stores to supply his wants on the passage, as it was
known that he would have to "go forward." He
soon found himself gliding over Charleston bar, and
took a last look of what to him had been the city of
injustice. On the afternoon of the second day, he
was sitting upon the forward deck eating an orange
that had been given to him by the steward of the
ship, probably as a token of sympathy for his sickly
appearance, when a number of passengers, acting
upon the information of the clerk of the ship, gathered
around him. One gentleman from Philadelphia,
who seemed to take more interest in the man
than any other of the passengers, expressed his indignation
in no measured terms, that such a man
should be imprisoned as a slave. "Take care," said
a bystander, "there's a good many Southerners on
board."</p>
            <p>"I don't care if every slaveholder in the South
was on board, holding a knife at my throat; I'm on
the broad ocean, where God spreads the breezes of
freedom that man cannot enslave," said he, sitting
down beside Manuel, and getting him to recount the<pb n="288"/>
details of his shipwreck and imprisonment. The
number increased around him, and all listened with
attention until he had concluded. One of the spectators
asked him if he would have something good to
eat? but he declined, pulling out the little box that
the consul had sent him, and, opening it before them,
showed it to be well-stored with little delicacies.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphian motioned that they take up a
subscription for him, and almost simultaneously took
his hat off and began to pass it around; but Manuel,
mistaking the motive, told them that he never yet
sought charity—that the consul had paid him his
wages, and he had money enough to get home. But
if he did not accept their contributions, he had their
sympathies and their good wishes, which were more
prized by him, because they were contrasted with the
cold hospitality he had suffered in Charleston.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the twentieth he arrived in
New York. Here things wore a different aspect.
There were no constables fettering him with irons,
aggravating his feelings, and dragging him to a
miseerable cell overrun with vermin. He had no
scientific ordeal of the statutes to pass through, requiring
the measure of his form and features; and he was a
man again, with life and liberty, and the dark dread
of the oppressor's power far from him. He went
to his comfortable boarding-house, and laid his weary
limbs down to rest, thanking God that he could now
sleep in peace, and awake to liberty. His system
was so reduced that he was unable to do duty,
although he was anxious to proceed on his way to
join the old owners, but wanted to work his way in
the capacity of steward. Thus he remained in New
York more than four weeks, gaining vigor and<pb n="289"/>
strength, and with a lingering hope that he should
meet his little companion.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-first of June, being well recruited,
he sailed for Liverpool, and after a remarkably calm
passage of thirty-four days, arrived in the Mersey,
and in forty-eight hours more the ship was safely
within the Princess' Dock, and all hands ready to go
on shore. In the same dock was a ship taking in
cargo and passengers for Charleston, South Carolina.
Manuel went on board, and found, in conversation
with the steward, that she had sailed from that port
on the 23d of May. A short conversation disclosed
that they had been old shipmates from the Thames,
on board of the Indiaman, Lord William Bentick,
and were on board of that ship when an unfortunate
circumstance occurred to her on entering a British
North American port, many years ago. Here they
sat recounting the many adventures through which
they had passed since that period, the ships they had
sailed in, the sufferings they had gone through, and
the narrow escapes they had had for their lives, until
past midnight. Manuel wound up by giving a detailed
account of his sufferings in Charleston.</p>
            <p>"What!" said the steward of the Charleston
ship, "then you must have known our cabin-boy, he
belonged to the same vessel!"</p>
            <p>"What was his name?" inquired Manuel.</p>
            <p>"Tommy Ward! and as nice a little fellow as ever
served the cabin; poor little fellow, we could hardly
get him across."</p>
            <p>"Gracious! that's my Tommy," said Manuel.
"Where is he? He loves me as he does his life, and
would run to me as a child would to its father. Little<pb n="290"/>
as he is, he has been a friend through my severest
trials, and a companion in my pleasures."</p>
            <p>"Ah, poor child! I'm afraid you wouldn't know
him now. He has suffered much since you saw
him."</p>
            <p>"Is he not aboard? Where can I find him?" inquired
Manuel, hastily.</p>
            <p>"No, he is not aboard; he is at the hospital in
Dennison street. Go there to-morrow, and you will
find him."</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
            <head type="sub">THE SCENE OF ANGUISH.</head>
            <p>WE are sorry, that having traced the details of
our narrative as they occurred, without adding for
dramatic effect, we are constrained to conclude with
a picture at once painful and harrowing to the feelings.
We do this that we may be sustained by records,
in what we have stated, rather than give one
of those more popular conclusions which restore
happiness and relieve the reader's feelings.</p>
            <p>Manuel retired to his berth, full of meditation.
His little companion was before him, pictured in his
child-like innocence and playfulness. He saw him in
the youthful zeal and freshness of the night when he
brought the well-laden haversack into his dreary cell,
and which kind act was repaid by a night of suffering
in the guard-house. There was too much of life
and buoyancy in the picture his imagination called
up, to reconcile the belief that any thing serious had<pb n="291"/>
befallen him; and yet the man spoke in a manner
that aroused the intensity of his feelings. It was a
whisper full of fearful forebodings, and filled his
mind with anxious expectation. He could not sleep—the
anxiety of his feelings had awakened a nervvous
restlessness that awaited the return of morning
with impatience.</p>
            <p>Morning came. He proceeded to the hospital and
rang the bell. An aged gentleman came to the door,
and to his questions about Tommy being there, answered
in the affirmative, and called an attendant to
show him the ward in which the little sufferer lay.
He followed the attendant, and after ascending several
flights of stairs and following a dark, narrow passage
nearly to its end, was shown into a small, single-room
on the right. The result was suggestive in the
very atmosphere, which had a singular effect upon the
senses. The room, newly-whitewashed, was darkened
by a green curtain tacked over the frame of the window.
Standing near the window were two wooden-stools
and a little table, upon which burned the faint
light of a small taper, arranged in a cup of oil, and
shedding its feeble flickers on the evidences of a sick-chamber.
There, on a little, narrow cot, lay the
death-like form of his once joyous companion, with
the old nurse sitting beside him, watching his last
pulsation. Her arm encircled his head, while his
raven locks curled over his forehead, and shadowed
the beauty of innocence even in death.</p>
            <p>"Is he there? is he there?" inquired Manuel in a
low tone. At the same time a low, gurgling noise
sounded in his ears. The nurse started to her feet
as if to inquire for what he came. "He is my
companion—my companion," said Manuel.</p>
            <pb n="292"/>
            <p>It was enough. The woman recognised the object
of the little sufferer's anxiety. "Ah! it is Manuel.
How often he has called that name for the last week!"
said she.</p>
            <p>He ran to the bedside and grasped his little fleshless
hand as it lay upon the white sheet, bathing his
cold brow with kisses of grief. Life was gone—the
spirit had winged its way to the God who gave it.
Thus closed the life of poor Tommy Ward. He died
as one resting in a calm sleep, far from the boisterous
sound of the ocean's tempest, with God's love to
shield his spirit in another and brighter world.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>IN a preceding chapter, we left the poor boy on
the plantation of Colonel Whaley, affected by a pulmonary
disease, the seeds of which were planted on
the night he was confined in the guard-house, and the
signs of gradual decay evinced their symptoms. After
Captain Williams—for such was the name of the captain
of the Three Sisters—left the plantation, no
person appeared to care for him, and on the second
day he was attacked with a fever, and sent to
one of the negro cabins, where an old mulatto woman
took care of him and nursed him as well as her scanty
means would admit. The fever continued for seven
days, when he became convalescent and able to walk
out; but feeling that he was an incumbrance to those
around him, he packed his clothes into a little bundle
and started for Charleston on foot. He reached that
city after four days' travelling over a heavy, sandy
road, subsisting upon the charity of poor negroes,<pb n="293"/>
whom he found much more ready to supply his wants
than the opulent planters. One night he, was compelled
to make a pillow of his little bundle, and lay
down in a corn-shed, where the planter, aroused by
the noise of his dogs, which were confined in a kennel,
came with a lantern and two negroes and discovered
him. At first he ordered him off, and threatened to
set the dogs upon him if he did not instantly comply
with the order; but his miserable appearance affected
the planter, and before he had gone twenty rods one
of the negroes overtook him, and said his master had
sent him to bring him back. He returned, and the
negro made him a coarse bed in his cabin, and gave
him some homony and milk.</p>
            <p>His hopes to see Manuel had buoyed him up through
every fatigue, but when he arrived, and was informed
at the jail that Manuel had left three days before,
his disappointment was extreme. A few days after
he shipped as cabin-boy on board a ship ready for
sea and bound to Liverpool. Scarcely half-way
across, he was compelled to resign himself to the
sick-list. The disease had struck deep into his system,
and was rapidly wasting him away. The sailors,
one by one in turns, watched over him with tenderness
and care. As soon as the ship arrived, he was
sent to the hospital, and there he breathed his last
as Manuel entered the sick-chamber. We leave
Manuel and a few of his shipmates following his
remains to the last resting-place of man.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SINCE the foregoing was written, Governor Means, in his
message to the Legislature of South Carolina, refers to the
laws under which "colored seamen" are imprisoned. We
make the subjoined extract, showing that he insists upon
its being continued in force, on the ground of
"self-preservation"—a right which ship-owners will please regard
for the protection of their own interests:—</p>
            <p>"I feel it my duty to call your attention to certain proceedings
which have grown out of the enforcement of that
law of our State which requires the Sheriff of Charleston to
seize and imprison colored seamen who are brought to that
port. You will remember that the British Consul addressed
a communication to the legislature in December, 1850, on
the subject of a modification of this law. A committee was
appointed by the House and Senate to report upon it at the
next session of the legislature. These committees reported
adverse to any modification. On the 24th March, 1852,
Manuel Pereira was imprisoned in accordance with the law
alluded to. The vessel in which he sailed was driven into
the port of Charleston in distress. This was looked upon
as a favorable case upon which to make an issue, as so strong
an element of sympathy was connected with it. Accordingly,
a motion was made before Judge Withers for a writ
of 'habeas corpus,' which was refused by him. These
proceedings were instituted by the British Consul, it is said,
under instructions from his government, to test the constitutionality
of the Act. I think it here proper to state, that<pb n="296"/>
Pereira was at perfect liberty to depart at any moment that
he could get a vessel to transport him beyond the limits of
the State. In truth, in consideration of the fact that his
coming into the State was involuntary, the Sheriff of Charleston,
with his characteristic kindness, procured for him a
place in a ship about to sail for Liverpool. Early in April,
Pereira was actually released, and on his way to the ship,
having himself signed the shipping articles, when, by interposition
of the British Consul, he was again consigned to
the custody of the sheriff. A few days after this, the
British Consul insisted no longer on his detention, but voluntarily
paid his passage to New York. This was looked
upon as an abandonment of that case. The statement of
Mr. Yates, together with the letter of the British Consul,
are herewith transmitted.</p>
            <p>"While these proceedings were pending, the Sheriff of
Charleston had my instructions not to give up the prisoners
even if a writ of habeas corpus had been granted. I
considered that the 'Act of 1844,' entitled, 'An Act more
effectually to prevent negroes and other persons of color
from entering into this State, and for other purposes,' made
it my duty to do so.</p>
            <p>"On the 19th May, Reuben Roberts, a colored seaman,
a native of Nassau, arrived in the steamer Clyde, from
Baracoa. The Sheriff of Charleston, in conformity with
the law of the State, which has been in force since 1823,
arrested and lodged him in the district jail, where he was
detained until the 26th of May, when, the Clyde being
ready to sail, Roberts was put on board, and sailed the same
day.</p>
            <p>"On the 9th of June, a writ in trespass, for assault and
false imprisonment, from the Federal Court, was served upon
Sheriff Yates, laying the damage at $4000.</p>
            <p>"The Act of 1844, I take it, was intended to prevent all
interference on the part of any power on the face of the
earth, with the execution of this police regulation, which is
so essential to the peace and safety of our community. Had
the legislature which passed it ever dreamed that the sheriff
was to be subjected to the annoyance of being dragged before
the Federal Court for doing his duty under a law of
the State, I am sure it would have provided for his protection.
As no such provision has been made for so unexpected<pb n="297"/>
a contingency, I recommend that you so amend this Act of
1844, that it may meet any case that may arise.</p>
            <p>"It is certainly wrong to tolerate this interference with
the laws enacted for the protection of our institution. In
the general distribution of power between the Federal and
State Governments, the right to make their own police
regulations was clearly reserved to the States. In fact, it
is nothing more nor less than the <emph>right of self-preservation</emph>—a
right which is above all constitutions, and above all
laws, and one which never was, nor never will be, abandoned
by a people who are worthy to be free. It is a right
which has never yet been attempted to be denied to any
people, except to us.</p>
            <p>"The complaint against this law is very strange, and the
attempt to bring us in conflict with the General Government
on account of it, is still more remarkable; when, so far
from its being at variance with the laws of the United States,
it is only requiring the State authorities to enforce an Act
of Congress, approved February 28th, 1803, entitled, An
Act to prevent the importation of certain persons into certain
States, where, by the laws thereof, their importation is
prohibited. By referring to this Act, you will see that the
plaintiff in the action alluded to was prohibited by it from
entering into this State. I deem it unnecessary, however,
to enter fully into the argument. If any doubt should be
entertained by you, as to its constitutionality, I beg leave
to refer to the able opinion of the Hon. J. McPherson Berrien,
delivered at the time he was Attorney-General of the
United States, which I herewith send you.</p>
            <p>"On the subject of the modification of this law, I am free
to say, that when Her B. M.'s Government, through its
consul, made a respectful request to our legislature to that
effect, I was anxious that it should be made. It was with
pleasure that I transmitted his first communication to the
last legislature. I would have made a recommendation of
its modification a special point in my first message, but that
I thought it indelicate to do so, as the matter was already
before the legislature, and committees had been appointed
to report upon it. Another reason for the neglect of this
recommendation, was the then excited state of party politics,
which might have precluded the possibility of a calm consideration
of the subject. But for the proceedings instituted<pb n="298"/>
in the premises, I would even now recommend a modification
of the law, so as to require captains to confine their colored
seamen to their vessels, and to prevent their landing under
heavy penalties. For while I think the State has a perfect
right to pass whatever laws on this subject it may deem
necessary for its safety, yet the spirit of the age requires
that while they should be so formed as to be adequate to
our protection, they should be at the same time as little
offensive as possible to other nations with whom we have
friendly relations. But since an attempt has been made to
defy our laws, and bring us in conflict with the Federal
Government, on a subject upon which we are so justly sensitive,
our own self-respect demands that we should not
abate one jot or tittle of that law, which was enacted to protect
us from the influence of ignorant incendiaries."</p>
            <p>We are under many obligations to <hi>Governor Means</hi> for
his remarks upon this subject. We esteem his character
too highly to entertain an idea that he would knowingly
make an incorrect statement; but, with a knowledge of the
facts, we can assure him that he was misled by those whom
he depended upon for information. And also, though his
name deserves to stand pre-eminent among the good men
of Carolina, for recurring to that frightful state of things
which exists in the Charleston prison, that he did not receive
a correct statement in regard to it. In this want, his
remarks lose much of their value. Subjects and grievances
exist there which he should know most of, and yet he knows
least, because he intrusts them to the <emph>caretakers</emph>, who make
abuses their medium of profit.</p>
            <p>Under the influence of that exceedingly suspicious, and
yet exceedingly credulous characteristic of a people, few
know the power that is working beneath the sunshine of
South Carolina, and those who do, stand upon that slaveworn
ostentation which considers it beneath notice.</p>
            <p>We have no interest nor feeling beyond that of humanity,
and a right to expose the mendacity of those who have<pb n="299"/>
power to exercise it over the prisoners in Charleston. That
mendacity has existed too long for the honor of that community,
and for the feelings of those who have suffered
under it.</p>
            <p>It may be true that this case was considered a favorable
one to try the issue upon, but no elements of sympathy
were sought by the consul. That functionary to whom the
Governor has attributed "characteristic kindness," said, in
our presence, and we have the testimony of others to confirm
what we say, that if Judge Withers had granted the habeas
corpus, he would not have given up the prisoner, but
rather gone to jail and suffered the same regimen with
the prisoners. Had he tried the accommodations, he would
have found the "profits" more than necessary to appease
common hunger.</p>
            <p>The Governor says, "Pereira was at liberty to depart at
any moment that he could get a vessel to transport him
beyond the limits of the State." How are we to reconcile
this with the following sentence, which appears in the next
paragraph:—"While these proceedings were pending,"
(<emph>meaning the action instituted by the consul to release the
prisoner</emph>,) "the sheriff of Charleston had my instructions
not to give up the prisoner, even if a writ of habeas corpus
had been granted?" According to this, the sheriff assumed
a power independent of and above the Governor's prerogative.
We have attempted to picture the force of this in
our work, and to show that there are official abuses cloaked
by an <emph>honorable dishonesty</emph>, which dignifies the business of
the local <emph>factor</emph> and <emph>vendor</emph> of human property, and which
should be stayed by the power of the Executive.</p>
            <p>The singular fact presents itself, that while Judge Withers
was deliberating upon the question of granting the "habeas
corpus," the proceedings pending, and the Governor's instructions
to the contrary before him, the sheriff takes it
upon himself to smuggle the prisoner out of port. Now<pb n="300"/>
what was the object of this Secret and concerted movement?
Was it "kindness" on the part of that functionary, who has
grasped every pretence to enforce this law? We think not.
The reader will not require any extended comments from
us to explain the motive; yet we witnessed it, and cannot
leave it without a few remarks.</p>
            <p>It is well known that it has been the aim of that functionary,
whose "<emph>characteristic kindness</emph>" has not failed to
escape the Governor's notice, to thwart the consul in all his
proceedings. In this instance, he engaged the services of
a "shipping master" as a pretext, and with him was about
to send the man away when his presence was essential to
test his right to the habeas corpus, and at this very time,
more than two months wages, due him from the owners,
lay in the hands of the consul, ready to be paid on his
release.</p>
            <p>The nefarious design speaks for itself.</p>
            <p>The consul was informed of the proceeding, and very
properly refused to submit to such a violation of authority,
intended to annul his proceedings. He preferred to await
the "<emph>test</emph>," demanding the prisoner's release through the
proper authorities. That release, instead of being "a few
days after this," as the message sets forth, was-not effected
until the fifteenth of May.</p>
            <p>Let the Governor institute an inquiry into the treatment
of these men by the officials, and the prison regimen, and he
will find the truth of what we have said. Public opinion
will not credit his award of "characteristic kindness" to
those who set up a paltry pretext as an apology for their
wrong-doing.</p>
            <p>If men are to be imprisoned upon this singular construction
of law, (which is no less than arming the fears of South
Carolina,) is it any more than just to ask that she should
pay for it, instead of imposing it upon innocent persons?
Or, to say the least, to make such comfortable provision for<pb n="301"/>
them as is made in the port of Savannah, and give them
what they pay for, instead of charging thirty cents a day
for their board, and making twenty-two of that profit?</p>
            <p>Had the Governor referred to the "<emph>characteristic kindness</emph>"
of the jailer, his remarks would have been bestowed
upon a worthy man, who has been a father to those unfortunates
who chanced within the turn of his key.</p>
            <p>In another part of his message, commenting upon the
existence of disgraceful criminal laws, the management
and wretched state of prisons, he says, "The attorney-general,
at my request, has drawn up a report on the subject
of prisons and prison discipline." Now, if such were
the facts, the reports would be very imperfect to be drawn
up by one who never visits the prisons.</p>
            <p>We are well aware that he called for this report, and
further, that the attorney-general, in a letter to the sheriff,
(of which we have a copy,) propounded numerous questions
in regard to the jail, calling for a statement in full, particularly
the amount of fees paid to certain functionaries;
those charged to the State, and the average number of prisoners
per month, from Sept. 1851, to Sept. 1852, &amp;c. &amp;c.
That letter was transmitted to the jailer—a man whose
character and integrity is well known, and above reproach
in Charleston—with a request that he would make out his
report. He drew up his report in accordance with the
calendar and the facts, but that report was not submitted.
Why was it not submitted? Simply because it showed the
profit of starving men in South Carolina prisons.</p>
            <p>We have the evidence in our possession, and can show
the Executive that he has been misled. We only ask him
to call for the <emph>original</emph> statement, made out in the jailer's
handwriting, and compare it with the calendar; and when
he has done that, let us ask, Why the average of prisoners
per month does not correspond? and why the enormous
amount of fees accruing from upward of <emph>fifty</emph> "colored<pb n="302"/>
seamen," imprisoned during the year, and entered upon
the calendar "<emph>contrary to law</emph>," was not included?</p>
            <p>It is a very unhealthy state of things, to say the least;
but as the sheriff considers it his own, perhaps we have no
right to meddle with it.</p>
            <p>All this clamor about the bad influence of "colored seamen"
is kept up by a set of mendicant officials who harvest
upon the fees, and falls to naught, when, at certain hours
of the day during their imprisonment, they are allowed to
associate with "bad niggers," committed for criminal
offences and sale. If their presence is "dangerous," it certainly
would be more dangerous in its connection with
criminals of the <emph>feared</emph> class.</p>
            <p>Take away the fees—the mercantile community will
not murmur, and the official <emph>gentry</emph> will neither abuse
nor trouble themselves about enforcing the law to imprison
<emph>freemen</emph>.</p>

            <head>THE WATER-CURE JOURNAL.</head>
            <head type="sub">VOL. XV. FOR 1853.</head>
            <p>HEALTH REFORM is emphatically the GREAT DEMAND OF THE AGE. Disease and
infirmity hang like deadly incubuses on the cause of human progress, marring the
happiness of mankind, and paralyzing the best energies of the human race.</p>
            <p>THE WATER-CURE JOURNAL has undertaken to educate the people in a knowledge
of the LAWS of HEALTH: and in fulfilling this great mission, it has attained a circulation
and influence unprecedented in the annals of medical literature. Wherever
its doctrines are thoroughly examined, they are approved in principle; wherever
they are intelligently tested, they are adopted in practice.</p>
            <p>THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE will be unfolded in all its PHYSIOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, MENTAL,
and MORAL RELATIONS. Believing that "sound minds in sound bodies" must be the
general rule in the community, instead of the exception, as at present, before humanity
can work out the glorious destiny of which it is capable, the natural and
perfect integrity of the WHOLE HUMAN BEING will continue to be the leading theme
of the Journal.</p>
            <p>THE PRESERVATION OF HEALTH will involve a consideration of the relations of AIR,
LIGHT, FOOD, DRINK, BATHING, TEMPERATURE, EXERCISE, CLOTHING, OCCUPATION, the
FASHIONS, &amp;c., as well as of every other hygienic influence which concerns the
growth and development of the human organism.</p>
            <p>THE RISING GENERATION are most deeply interested in acquiring a knowledge of
the SCIENCE of HUMAN LIFE. The young, the gifted, the accomplished, are daily and
hourly cut down in their promise, whilst manhood is blasted in its prime. Here,
again, ignorance is the evil—knowledge the remedy.</p>
            <p>A POPULAR WORK.—<emph>Let it be borne in mind</emph> that the WATER-CURE JOURNAL is a
thoroughly POPULAR WORK, a work for the people, and not the organ of a profession
or sect. Its aim is to make every reader acquainted with the structure, functions,
and relations of his own body; and to be to every one an unerring guide in the
preservation of health, or its restoration.</p>
            <p>Published monthly, at One Dollar a year. Please address all letters, post-paid, to
FOWLERS AND WELLS, Clinton Hall, 131 Nassau Street, New York.</p>
            <p>"Judging from their past character, we have not the shadow of a doubt of their
continued and extensive popularity. They are utterly free from 'old fogyism'
They are always fresh—without pedantry—talking 'right straight out' to the
people—explaining the laws of life in a common-sense style. *  *  *  *  We are
bound to say, that the present journals devoted to their exposition are models of
popular instruction, and well suited to do good to the 'world in general.'"—<title>New
