            <p>The musical capacity of the negro race has been recognized
for so many years that it is hard to explain why
no systematic effort has hitherto been made to collect
and preserve their melodies. More than thirty years
ago those plantation songs made their appearance which
were so extraordinarily popular for a while; and if
“Coal-black Rose,” “Zip Coon” and “Ole Virginny
nebber tire” have been succeeded by spurious imitations,
manufactured to suit the somewhat sentimental
taste of our community, the fact that these were called
“negro melodies” was itself a tribute to the musical
genius of the race.<ref n="1" rend="sc" target="note1"> ∗</ref>
               <note n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref1">
                  <p>∗ It is not generally known that the beautiful air “Long time ago,” or
“Near the lake where drooped the willow,” was borrowed from the negroes, by whom it was sung to words beginning, “Way down in Raccoon Hollow.”</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The public had well-nigh forgotten these genuine slave
songs, and with them the creative power from which
they sprung, when a fresh interest was excited through
the educational mission to the Port Royal islands, in
1861. The agents of this mission were not long in discovering
<pb n="ii"/>
the rich vein of music that existed in these half-barbarous
people, and when visitors from the North
were on the islands, there was nothing that seemed better
worth their while than to see a “shout” or hear the
“people” sing their “sperichils.” A few of these last,
of special merit,<ref n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">∗</ref>
               <note n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref2">
                  <p>∗ The first seven spirituals in this collection, which were regularly sung at the church. </p>
               </note>
soon became established favorites
among the whites, and hardly a Sunday passed at the
church on St. Helena without “Gabriel's Trumpet,” “I
hear from Heaven to-day,” or “Jehovah Hallelujah.”
The last time I myself heard these was at the Fourth of
July celebration, at the church, in 1864. All of them
were sung, and then the glorious shout, “I can't stay
behind, my Lord,” was struck up, and sung by the entire
multitude with a zest and spirit, a swaying of the
bodies and nodding of the heads and lighting of the
countenances and rhythmical movement of the hands,
which I think no one present will ever forget.</p>
            <p>Attention was, I believe, first publicly directed to
these songs in a letter from Miss McKim, of Philadelphia,
to <hi rend="italics">Dwight's Journal of Music</hi>, Nov. 8, 1862, from which
some extracts will presently be given. At about the
same time, Miss McKim arranged and published two of
them, “Roll, Jordan” (No. 1) and “Poor Rosy” (No. 8)—probably on all accounts the two best specimens that
could be selected. Mr. H. G. Spaulding not long after
gave some well-chosen specimens of the music in an article
entitled “Under the Palmetto,” in the <hi rend="italics">Continental</hi>
               <pb n="iii"/>
               <hi rend="italics">Monthly</hi> for August, 1863, among them, “O Lord, remember
me” (No. 15), and “The Lonesome Valley”
(No. 7). Many other persons interested themselves in
the collection of words and tunes, and it seems time at
last that the partial collections in the possession of the
editors, and known by them to be in the possession of
others, should not be forgotten and lost, but that these
relics of a state of society which has passed away should
be preserved while it is still possible. <ref n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">∗</ref>
               <note n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref3">
                  <p>∗ Only this last spring a valuable collection of songs made at Richmond, Va., was lost in the <hi rend="italics">Wagner</hi>. No copy had been made from the original manuscript, so that the labor of their collection was lost. We had hoped to have the use of them in preparing the present work.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The greater part of the music here presented has been
taken down by the editors from the lips of the colored
people themselves; when we have obtained it from other
sources, we have given credit in the table of contents.
The largest and most accurate single collection in existence
is probably that made by Mr. Charles P. Ware,
chiefly at Coffin's Point, St. Helena Island. We have
thought it best to give this collection in its entirety, as
the basis of the present work; it includes all the hymns
as far as No. 43. Those which follow, as far as No. 55,
were collected by myself on the Capt. John Fripp and
neighboring plantations, on the same island. In all
cases we have added words from other sources and other
localities, when they could be obtained, as well as variations
of the tunes wherever they were of sufficient importance
to warrant it. Of the other hymns and songs
<pb n="iv"/>
we have given the locality whenever it could be ascertained.</p>
            <p>The difficulty experienced in attaining absolute correctness
is greater than might be supposed by those who
have never tried the experiment, and we are far from
claiming that we have made no mistakes. I have never
felt quite sure of my notation without a fresh comparison
with the singing, and have then often found that I
had made some errors. I feel confident, however, that
there are no mistakes of importance. What may appear
to some to be an incorrect rendering is very likely to
be a variation; for these variations are endless, and
very entertaining and instructive.</p>
            <p>Neither should any one be repelled by any difficulty
in adapting the words to the tunes. The negroes keep
exquisite time in singing, and do not suffer themselves
to be daunted by any obstacle in the words. The most
obstinate Scripture phrases or snatches from hymns they
will force to do duty with any tune they please, and
will dash heroically through a trochaic tune at the head
of a column of iambs with wonderful skill. We have in
all cases arranged one set of words carefully to each
melody; for the rest, one must make them fit the best
he can, as the negroes themselves do.</p>
            <p>The best that we can do, however, with paper and
types, or even with voices, will convey but a faint shadow
of the original. The voices of the colored people
have a peculiar quality that nothing can imitate; and
the intonations and delicate variations of even one
<pb n="v"/>
singer cannot be reproduced on paper. And I despair
of conveying any notion of the effect of a number singing
together, especially in a complicated shout, like “I can't
stay behind, my Lord” (No. 8), or “Turn, sinner, turn
O!” (No. 48). There is no singing in <hi rend="italics">parts</hi>,<ref n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">∗</ref>
               <note n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref4">
                  <p>∗ “The high voices, all in unison, and the admirable time and true accent
with which their responses are made, always make me wish that some great musical composer could hear these semi-savage performances. With a very little skilful adaptation and instrumentation, I think one or two barbaric chants and choruses might be evoked from them that would make the fortune of an opera.”—<hi rend="italics">Mrs. Kemble's “Life on a Georgian Plantation</hi>,” p. 218.</p>
               </note>
as we understand it,
and yet no two appear to be singing the
same thing—the leading singer starts the words of each
verse, often improvising, and the others, who “base”
him, as it is called, strike in with the refrain, or even
join in the solo, when the words are familiar. When
the “base” begins, the leader often stops, leaving the
rest of his words to be guessed at, or it may be they are
taken up by one of the other singers. And the “basers”
themselves seem to follow their own whims, beginning
when they please and leaving off when they please,
striking an octave above or below (in case they have
pitched the tune too low or too high), or hitting some
other note that chords, so as to produce the effect of a
marvellous complication and variety, and yet with the
most perfect time, and rarely with any discord. And
what makes it all the harder to unravel a thread of melody
out of this strange network is that, like birds, they
seem not infrequently to strike sounds that cannot be
precisely represented by the gamut, and abound in
<pb n="vi"/>
“slides from one note to another, and turns and cadences
not in articulated notes.” “It is difficult,” writes Miss
McKim, “to express the entire character of these negro
ballads by mere musical notes and signs. The odd turns
made in the throat, and the curious rhythmic effect produced
by single voices chiming in at different irregular
intervals, seem almost as impossible to place on the
score as the singing of birds or the tones of an Aeolian
Harp.” There are also apparent irregularities in the
time, which it is no less difficult to express accurately,
and of which Nos. 10, 130,131, and (eminently) 128, are
examples.</p>
            <p>Still, the chief part of the negro music is <hi rend="italics">civilized</hi> in
its character—partly composed under the influence of
association with the whites, partly actually imitated
from their music. In the main it appears to be original
in the best sense of the word, and the more we examine
the subject, the more genuine it appears to us to be. In
a very few songs, as Nos. 19, 23, and 25, strains of familiar
tunes are readily traced; and it may easily be that others
contain strains of less familiar music, which the slaves
heard their masters sing or play.<ref n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">∗</ref>
               <note n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref5">
                  <p>∗ We have rejected as spurious “Give me Jesus,” “Climb Jacob's Ladder,”
(both sung at Port Royal), and “I'll take the wings of the morning,” which
we find in Methodist hymn-books. A few others, the character of which
seemed somewhat suspicious, we have not felt at liberty to reject without direct evidence<corr>.</corr>
                  </p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand there are very few which are of an
intrinsically barbaric character, and where this character
does appear, it is chiefly in short passages, intermingled
<pb n="vii"/>
with others of a different character. Such passages may
be found perhaps in Nos. 10, 12, and 18; and “Becky
Lawton,” for instance (No. 29), “Shall I die?” (No. 52)
“Round the corn, Sally” (No. 87), and “O'er the
crossing” (No. 93) may very well be purely African in
origin. Indeed, it is very likely that if we had found it
possible to get at more of their secular music, we should
have come to another conclusion as to the proportion of
the barbaric element. A gentleman in Delaware writes:</p>
            <p>“We must look among their non-religious songs for
the purest specimens of negro minstrelsy, It is remarkable
that they have themselves transferred the best of
these to the uses of their churches—I suppose on Mr.
Wesley's principle that ‘it is not right the Devil should
have all the good tunes.’ Their leaders and preachers
have not found this change difficult to effect; or at least
they have taken so little pains about it that one often
detects the profane <hi rend="italics">cropping out</hi>, and revealing the origin
of their most solemn ‘hymns,’ in spite of the best intentions
of the poet and artist. Some of the best <hi rend="italics">pure
negro</hi> songs I have ever heard were those that used to
be sung by the black stevedores, or perhaps the crews
themselves, of the West India vessels, loading and unloading
at the wharves in Philadelphia and Baltimore.
I have stood for more than an hour, often, listening to
them, as they hoisted and lowered the hogsheads and
boxes of their cargoes; one man taking the burden of
the song (and the slack of the rope) and the others
striking in with the chorus. They would sing in this
<pb n="viii"/>
way more than a dozen different songs in an hour; most
of which might indeed be warranted to contain ‘nothing
religious’—a few of them, ‘on the contrary, quite the
reverse’—but generally rather innocent and proper in
their language, and strangely attractive in their music;
and with a volume of voice that reached a square or two
away. That plan of labor has now passed away, in Philadelphia
at least, and the songs, I suppose, with it. So
that these performances are to be heard only among
black sailors on their vessels, or ‘long-shore men in out-of-the-way
places, where opportunities for respectable
persons to hear them are rather few.”</p>
            <p>These are the songs that are still heard upon the Mississippi
steamboats—wild and strangely fascinating—one of which we have been so fortunate as to secure for
this collection. This, too, is no doubt the music of the
colored firemen of Savannah, graphically described by
Mr. Kane O'Donnel, in a letter to the Philadelphia
<hi rend="italics">Press</hi>, and one of which he was able to contribute for our
use. Mr. E. S. Philbrick was struck with the resemblance
of some of the rowing tunes at Port-Royal to the
boatmen's songs he had heard upon the Nile.</p>
            <p>The greater number of the songs which have come into
our possession seem to be the natural and original production
of a race of remarkable musical capacity and
very teachable, which has been long enough associated
with the more cultivated race to have become imbued
with the mode and spirit of European music—often,
nevertheless, retaining a distinct tinge of their native
Africa.</p>
            <pb n="ix"/>
            <p>The words are, of course, in a large measure taken
from Scripture, and from the hymns heard at church;
and for this reason these religious songs do not by any
means illustrate the full extent of the debasement of the
dialect. Such expressions as “Cross Jordan,” “O Lord,
remember me,” “I'm going home,” “There's room
enough in Heaven for you,” we find abundantly in Methodist
hymn-books; but with much searching I have
been able to find hardly a trace of the tunes. The
words of the fine hymn, “Praise, member” (No. 5), are
found, with very little variation, in “Choral Hymns”
(No. 138). The editor of this collection informs us,
however, that many of his songs were learned from negroes
in Philadelphia, and Lt.-Col. Trowbridge tells us
that he heard this hymn, before the war, among the colored
people of Brooklyn.<ref n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">∗</ref>
               <note n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref6">
                  <p>∗ We have generally preserved the words as sung, even where clearly nonsensical, as in No. 89; so “Why don't you move so slow?” (No. 22). We will add that “Paul and Silas, bound in jail” (No. 4) is often sung “Bounden Cyrus born in jail,” and the words of No. 11 would appear as “I take my tex in Matchew and by de Revolutions—I know you by your gammon,”&amp;c.; so “Ringy Rosy Land” for “Ring Jerusalem.”</p>
               </note>
For some very comical specimens
of the way in which half-understood words and
phrases are distorted by them, see Nos. 22, 23. Another
illustration is given by Col. Higginson: <ref n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">†</ref>

            <p>“The popular camp-song of ‘Marching Along’ was
entirely new to them until our quartermaster taught it
to them at my request. The words ‘Gird on the armor’
were to them a stumbling-block, and no wonder, until
<pb n="x"/>
some ingenious ear substituted ‘Guide on de army,’
which was at once accepted and became universal.
‘We'll guide on de army, and be marching along,’ is
now the established version on the Sea Islands.”</p>
            <p>I never fairly heard a secular song among the Port
Royal freedmen, and never saw a musical instrument
among them. The last violin, owned by a “worldly
man,” disappeared from Coffin's Point “de year gun
shoot at Bay Pint.”<ref n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">∗</ref>

 In other parts of the South,
“fiddle-sings,” “devil-songs,” “corn-songs,” “jig-tunes,”
and what not, are common; all the world knows the
banjo, and the “Jim Crow” songs of thirty years
ago. We have succeeded in obtaining only a very few
songs of this character. Our intercourse with the
colored people has been chiefly through the work of
the Freedmen's Commission, which deals with the
serious and earnest side of the negro character. It is
often, indeed, no easy matter to persuade them to sing
their old songs, even as a curiosity, such is the sense of
dignity that has come with freedom. It is earnestly to
be desired that some person, who has the opportunity,
should make a collection of these now, before it is too late.</p>
            <p>In making the present collection, we have only gleaned
upon the surface, and in a very narrow field. The wealth
of material still awaiting the collector can be guessed
from a glance at the localities of those we have, and from
<pb n="xi"/>
the fact, mentioned above, that of the first forty-three of
the collection most were sung upon a single plantation,
and that it is very certain that the stores of this plantation
were by no means exhausted. Of course there was
constant intercourse between neighboring plantations;
also between different States, by the sale of slaves from
one to another. But it is surprising how little this seems
to have affected local songs, which are different even upon
adjoining plantations. The favorite of them all, “Roll,
Jordan” (No. 1), is sung in Florida, but not, I believe,
in North Carolina. “Gabriel's Trumpet” (No. 4) and
“Wrestle on, Jacob” (No 6) probably came from Virginia,
where they are sung without much variation from
the form usual at Port Royal; No. 6 is also sung in
Maryland.<ref n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">∗</ref>

                  <p>∗ It is worthy of notice that a song much resembling “Poor Rosy” was
heard last Spring from the boat hands of an Ohio River steamboat—the only words caught being “Poor Molly, poor gal.”</p>
               </note>
“John, John of the Holy Order” (No. 22)
is traced in Georgia and North Carolina, and “O'er the
Crossing” (No. 93) appears to be the Virginia original,
variations of which are found in South Carolina, Georgia,
and Tennessee. As illustrations of the slowness with
which these songs travel, it may be mentioned that the
“Graveyard” (No. 21), which was frequently sung on
Capt. John Fripp's plantation in the winter of 1863-4,
did not reach Coffin's Point (five miles distant) until
the following Spring. I heard it myself at Pine Grove,
two miles from the latter place, in March. Somewhere
<pb n="xii"/>
upon this journey this tune was strikingly altered, as
will be seen from the variation given, which is the form
in which I was accustomed to hear it. Nos. 38, 41, 42, 43,
118, 119, 122, 123, were brought to Coffin's Point after
Mr. Ware left, by refugees returning to the plantation
from “town” and the Main. No. 74, likewise, “Nobody
knows the trouble I see,” which was common in Charleston
in 1865, has since been carried to Coffin's Point, very
little altered.</p>
            <p>These hymns will be found peculiarly interesting in
illustrating the feelings, opinions and habits of the slaves.
Of the dialect I shall presently speak at some length.
One of their customs, often alluded to in the songs (as
in No. 19), is that of wandering through the woods
and swamps, when under religious excitement, like the
ancient bacchantes. To get religion is with them to
“fin' dat ting.” Molsy described thus her sister's experience
in searching for religion: “Couldn't fin' dat leetle
ting—hunt for 'em—huntin' for 'em all de time—las'
foun' 'em.” And one day, on our way to see a “shout,”
we asked Bristol whether he was going:—“No, ma'am,
wouldn't let me in—hain't foun' dat ting yet—hain't
been on my knees in de swamp.” Of technical religious
expressions, “seeker,” “believer,” “member,” &amp;c., the
songs are full.</p>
            <p>The most peculiar and interesting of their customs is
the “shout,” an excellent description of which we are permitted
to copy from the N. Y. <hi rend="italics">Nation</hi> of May 30, 1867:</p>
            <p>“This is a ceremony which the white clergymen are
inclined to discountenance, and even of the colored elders
<pb n="xiii"/>
some of the more discreet try sometimes to put on a face
of discouragement; and although, if pressed for Biblical
warrant for the shout, they generally seem to think
‘he in de Book,’ or ‘he dere-da in Matchew,’ still it is
not considered blasphemous or improper if ‘de chillen’
and ‘dem young gal’ carry it on in the evening for amusement's
sake, and with no well-defined intention of ‘praise.’
But the true ‘shout’ takes place on Sundays or on
‘praise’-nights through the week, and either in the
praise-house or in some cabin in which a regular religious
meeting has been held. Very likely more than half the
population of the plantation is gathered together. Let it
be the evening, and a light-wood fire burns red before
the door of the house and on the hearth. For some
time one can hear, though at a good distance, the vociferous
exhortation or prayer of the presiding elder or of
the brother who has a gift that way, and who is not ‘on
the back seat,’—a phrase, the interpretation of which is,
‘under the censure of the church authorities for bad
behavior;’—and at regular intervals one bears the elder
‘deaconing’ a hymn-book hymn, which is sung two lines
at a time, and whose wailing cadences, borne on the
night air, are indescribably melancholy. But the
benches are pushed back to the wall when the formal
meeting is over, and old and young, men and women,
sprucely-dressed young men, grotesquely half-clad field-hands
—the women generally with gay handkerchiefs
twisted about their heads and with short skirts—boys
with tattered shirts and men's trousers, young girls barefooted,
<pb n="xiv"/>
all stand up in the middle of the floor, and
when the ‘sperichil’ is struck up, begin first walking
and by-and-by shuffling round, one after the other, in a
ring. The foot is hardly taken from the floor, and the
progression is mainly due to a jerking, hitching motion,
which agitates the entire shouter, and soon brings out
streams of perspiration. Sometimes they dance silently,
sometimes as they shuffle they sing the chorus of the spiritual,
and sometimes the song itself is also sung by the
dancers. But more frequently a band, composed of
some of the best singers and of tired shouters, stand at
the side of the room to ‘base’ the others, singing the
body of the song and clapping their hands together or
on the knees. Song and dance are alike extremely energetic,
and often, when the shout lasts into the middle of
the night, the monotonous thud, thud of the feet prevents
sleep within half a mile of the praise-house.”</p>
            <p>In the form here described, the “shout” is probably
confined to South Carolina and the States south of it. It
appears to be found in Florida, but not in North Carolina
or Virginia. It is, however, an interesting fact that
the term “shouting” is used in Virginia in reference to
a peculiar motion of the body not wholly unlike the
Carolina shouting. It is not unlikely that this remarkable
religious ceremony is a relic of some native African
dance, as the Romaika is of the classical Pyrrhic.
Dancing in the usual way is regarded with great horror
by the people of Port Royal, but they enter with infinite
zest into the movements of the “shout.” It has its
<pb n="xv"/>
connoisseurs, too. “Jimmy great shouter,” I was told;
and Jimmy himself remarked to me, as he looked patronizingly
on a ring of young people, “Dese yere
worry deyseff—we don't worry weseff.” And indeed,
although the perspiration streamed copiously down his
shiny face, he shuffled round the circle with great ease
and grace.</p>
            <p>The shouting may be to any tune, and perhaps all the
Port Royal hymns here given are occasionally used for
this purpose; so that our cook's classification into
“sperichils” and “runnin' sperichils” (shouts), or the
designation of certain ones as sung “just sittin' round,
you know,” will hardly hold in strictness. In practice,
however, a distinction is generally observed. The first
seven, for instance, favorite hymns in the St. Helena
church, would rarely, if ever, be used for shouting;
while probably on each plantation there is a special set
in common use. On my plantation I oftenest heard
“Pray all de member” (No. 47), “Bell da ring” (No. 46),
“Shall I die?” (No. 52), and “I can't stay behind, my
Lord” (No. 8). The shouting step varied with the
tune; one could hardly dance with the same spirit to
“Turn, sinner,” or “My body rock 'long fever,” as to
“Rock o' Jubilee,” or “O Jerusalem, early in de morning.”
So far as I can learn, the shouting is confined to
the Baptists; and it is, no doubt, to the overwhelming
preponderance of this denomination on the Sea Islands
that we owe the peculiar richness and originality of the
music there<corr>.</corr>
            </p>
            <pb n="xvi"/>
            <p>The same songs are used for rowing as for shouting.
I know only one pure boat-song, the fine lyric, “Michael
row the boat ashore” (No. 31); and this I have
no doubt is a real spiritual—it being the archangel
Michael that is addressed. Among the most common
rowing tunes were Nos. 5, 14, 17, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
32, 33, 36, 46. “As I have written these tunes,” says
Mr. Ware, “two measures are to be sung to each stroke,
the first measure being accented by the beginning of the
stroke, the second by the rattle of the oars in the row-locks.
On the passenger boat at the [Beaufort] ferry,
they rowed from sixteen to thirty strokes a minute;
twenty-four was the average. Of the tunes I have heard,
I should say that the most lively were ‘Heaven bell a-ring’
(No. 27), ‘Jine 'em’ (No. 28), ‘Rain fall’ (No. 29),
‘No man’ (No. 14), ‘Bell da ring’ (No. 46), and ‘Can't
stay behind;’ and that ‘Lay this body down’ (No. 26),
‘Religion so sweet’ (No.17), and ‘Michael row’ (No. 31),
were used when the load was heavy or the tide was
against us. I think that the long hold on ‘Oh,’ in ‘Rain
fall,’ was only used in rowing. When used as a ‘shout’
I am quite sure that it occupied only one measure, as in
the last part of the verse. One noticeable thing about
their boat-songs was that they seemed often to be sung
just a trifle behind time; in ‘Rain fall,’ for instance,
‘Believer cry holy’ would seem to occupy more than its
share of the stroke, the ‘holy’ being prolonged till the
very beginning of the next stroke; indeed, I think Jerry
<pb n="xvii"/>
often hung on his oar a little just there before dipping
it again.”<ref n="10" rend="sc" target="note10">∗</ref>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>As to the composition of these songs, “I always wondered,”
says Col. Higginson, “whether they had always
a conscious and definite origin in some leading mind, or
whether they grew by gradual accretion, in an almost
unconscious way. On this point I could get no information,
though I asked many questions, until at last, one
day when I was being rowed across from Beaufort to
Ladies' Island, I found myself, with delight, on the actual
trail of a song. One of the oarsmen, a brisk young
fellow, not a soldier, on being asked for his theory of the
matter, dropped out a coy confession. ‘Some good
sperituals,’ he said, ‘are start jess out o' curiosity. I
been a-raise a sing, myself, once.’</p>
            <p>“My dream was fulfilled, and I had traced out, not
the poem alone, but the poet. I implored him to proceed.</p>
            <p>“‘Once we boys,’ he said, ‘went for tote some rice,
and de nigger-driver, he keep a-callin' on us; and I say,
‘O, de ole nigger-driver!’ Den anudder said, ‘Fust
ting my mammy told me was, notin' so bad as nigger-drivers.’
Den I made a sing, just puttin' a word, and
den anudder word.‘</p>
            <p>“Then he began singing and the men, after listening
a moment, joined in the chorus as if it were an old acquaintance,
<pb n="xviii"/>
though they evidently had never heard it
before. I saw how easily a new ‘sing’ took root among
them.”</p>
            <p>A not inconsistent explanation is that given on page
12 of an “Address delivered by J. Miller McKim, in
Sansom Hall, Philadelphia, July 9, 1862.”</p>
            <p>“I asked one of these blacks—one of the most intelligent
of them [Prince Rivers, Sergeant 1st Reg. S. C. V.]
—where they got these songs. ‘Dey make 'em, sah.’
‘How do they make them?’ After a pause, evidently
casting about for an explanation, he said: ‘I'll tell you,
it's dis way. My master call me up, and order me a
short peck of corn and a hundred lash. My friends see
it, and is sorry for me. When dey come to de praise-meeting
dat night dey sing about it. Some's very good
singers and know how; and dey work it in—work it in,
you know, till they get it right; and dat's de way.’ A
very satisfactory explanation; at least so it seemed to me.”</p>
            <p>We were not so fortunate as Col. Higginson in our
search for a poet. Cuffee at Pine Grove did, to be sure,
confess himself the author of “Climb Jacob's Ladder;”—
unfortunately, we afterwards found it in a Northern
hymn book. And if you try to trace out a new song,
and ask, “Where did you hear that?” the answer will
be, “One strange man come from Eding's las' praise-night
and sing 'em in praise-house, and de people catch
'em;” or “Titty 'Mitta [sister Amaritta] fetch 'em from
Polawana, where she tuk her walk gone spend Sunday.
Some of her fahmly sing' em yonder.” “But what does
<pb n="xix"/>
‘Ringy rosy land’ [Ring Jerusalem, No. 21] mean?”
“Me dunno.”</p>
            <p>Our title, “Slave Songs,” was selected because it
best described the contents of the book. A few of
those here given (Nos. 64, 59) were, to be sure, composed
since the proclamation of emancipation, but even these
were inspired by slavery. “All, indeed, are valuable as
an expression of the character and life of the race
which is playing such a conspicuous part in our history.
The wild, sad strains tell, as the sufferers themselves
could, of crushed hopes, keen sorrow, and a dull, daily
misery, which covered them as hopelessly as the fog from
the rice swamps. On the other hand, the words breathe
a trusting faith in rest for the future—in ‘Canaan's air
and happy land,’ to which their eyes seem constantly
turned.”</p>
            <p>Our original plan hardly contemplated more than the
publication of the Port Royal spirituals, some sixty in
all, which we had supposed we could obtain, with perhaps
a few others in an appendix. As new materials
came into our hands, we enlarged our plan to the present
dimensions. Next to South Carolina, we have the
largest number from Virginia; from the other States
comparatively few. Few as they are, however, they appear
to indicate a very distinct character in different
States. Contrary to what might be expected, the songs
from Virginia are the most wild and strange. “O'er the
Crossing,” (No. 93) is peculiarly so; but “Sabbath has
no end” (No. 89), “Hypocrite and Concubine” (No. 91),
<pb n="xx"/>
“O shout away” (No. 92), and “Let Gods saints come
in” (No. 99), are all distinguished by odd intervals and
frequent use of chromatics. The songs from North
Carolina are also very peculiar, although in a different
way, and make one wish for more specimens from that
region. Those from Tennessee and Florida are most
like the music of the whites.</p>
            <p>We had hoped to obtain enough secular songs to
make a division by themselves; there are, however, so
few of these that it has been decided to intersperse them
with the spirituals under their respective States. They
are highly characteristic, and will be found not the
least interesting of the contents of this work.</p>
            <p>It is, we repeat, already becoming difficult to obtain
these songs. Even the “spirituals” are going out of use
on the plantations, superseded by the new style of religious
music, “closely imitated from the white people, which is
solemn, dull and nasal, consisting in repeating two lines
of a hymn and then singing it, and then two more, <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad
infinitum</foreign>
               </hi>. They use for this sort of worship that one
everlasting melody, which may be remembered by all
persons familiar with Western and Southern camp-meetings,
as applying equally well to long, short or common
metre. This style of proceeding they evidently consider
the more dignified style of the two, as being a closer
imitation of white, genteel worship—having in it about
as little soul as most stereotyped religious forms of well
instructed congregations.”<ref n="11" rend="sc" target="note11"> ∗</ref>

            <pb n="xxi"/>
            <p>It remains to speak of points connected with the typography
of the songs.</p>
            <p>We have aimed to give all the characteristic variations
which have come into our hands, whether as single notes
or whole lines, or even longer passages; and of words
as well as tunes. Many of these will be found very interesting
and instructive. The variations in words are
given as foot-notes—the word or group of words in the
note, to be generally substituted for that which precedes
the mark: and it may be observed, although it seems
hardly necessary, that these variations are endless; such
words as “member,” “ believer,” “seeker,” and all
names, male and female, may be brought in wherever
appropriate. We have not always given all the sets of
words that we have received often they are improvised
to such an extent that this would be almost impracticable.
In Nos. 16, 17, 19, etc., we have given them
very copiously, for illustration; in others we have omitted
the least interesting ones. In spelling, we proposed
to ourselves the rule well stated by Col. Higginson at
the commencement of his collection: “The words will
be here given, as nearly as possible, in the original dialect;
and if the spelling seems sometimes inconsistent,
or the misspelling insufficient, it is because I could get
no nearer.”</p>
            <p>As the negroes have no part-singing, we have thought
it best to print only the melody; what appears in some
places as harmony is really variations in single notes.
And, in general, a succession of such notes turned in the
<pb n="xxii"/>
same direction indicates a single longer variation.
Words in a parenthesis, with small notes, (as “Brudder
Sammy” in No. 21), are interjaculatory; it has not, however,
been possible to maintain entire consistency in
this matter. Sometimes, as “no man” and “O no
man,” in No. 14, interchangeable forms are put, for convenience
sake, in different parts of the tune.</p>
            <p>It may sometimes be a little difficult, for instance in
Nos. 9, 10, 20 and 27, to determine precisely which part
of the tune each verse belongs to; in these cases we have
endeavored to indicate it as clearly as is in our power.
However much latitude the reader may take in all
such matters, he will hardly take more than the negroes
themselves do. In repeating, it may be observed that
the custom at Port Royal is to repeat the first part of
the tune over and over, it may be a dozen times, before
passing to the “turn,” and then to do the same with
that. In the Virginia songs, on the other hand, the
chorus is usually sung twice after each verse—often the
second time with some such interjaculatory expression
as “I say now,” “God say you must,” as given in
No. 99.</p>
            <p>We had some thought of indicating with each the
<hi rend="italics">tempo</hi> of the different songs, but have concluded to print
special directions for singing by themselves. It should
be remarked, however, that the same tune varied in
quickness on different occasions. “As the same songs,”
writes Miss McKim, “are sung at every sort of work, of
course the <hi rend="italics">tempo</hi> is not always alike. On the water, the
<pb n="xxiii"/>
oars dip ‘Poor Rosy’ to an even <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="ita">andante</foreign>
               </hi>; a stout boy
and girl at the hominy mill will make the same ‘Poor
Rosy’ fly, to keep up with the whirling stone; and in
the evening, after the day's work is done, ‘Heab'n
shall-a be my home’ peals up slowly and mournfully
from the distant quarters. One woman, a respectable
house-servant, who had lost all but one of her twenty-two
children, said to me: ‘Pshaw! don't har to dese
yer chil'en, missee. Dey just rattles it off—dey don't
know how for sing it. I likes ‘Poor Rosy’ better dan
all de songs, but it can't be sung widout <hi rend="italics">a full heart and
a troubled sperrit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rests, by the way, do not indicate a cessation in
the music, but only in part of the singers. They overlap
in singing, as already described, in such a degree that
at no time is there any complete pause. In “A House
in Paradise” (No. 40) this overlapping is most marked.</p>
            <p>IT will be noticed that we have spoken chiefly of the
negroes of the Port Royal islands, where most of our
observations were made, and most of our materials collected.
The remarks upon the dialect which follow have
reference solely to these islands, and indeed almost exclusively
to a few plantations at the northern end of St. Helena
Island. They will, no doubt, apply in a greater or
less degree to the entire region of the southeasterly slave
States, but not to other portions of the South. It should
also be understood that the corruptions and peculiarities
here described are not universal, even here. There are
<pb n="xxiv"/>
all grades, from the rudest field-hands to mechanics and
house-servants, who speak with a considerable degree of
correctness, and perhaps few would be found so illiterate
as to be guilty of them all.</p>
            <p>Ordinary negro talk, such as we find in books, has
very little resemblance to that of the negroes of Port
Royal, who have been so isolated heretofore that they
have almost formed a dialect of their own. Indeed, the
different plantations have their own peculiarities, and
adepts profess to be able to determine by the speech of
a negro what part of an island he belongs to, or even, in
some cases, his plantation. I can myself vouch for the
marked peculiarities of speech of one plantation from
which I had scholars, and which was hardly more than
a mile distant from another which lacked these peculiarities.
Songs, too, and, I suppose, customs, vary in the
same way.</p>
            <p>A stranger, upon first hearing these people talk, especially
if there is a group of them in animated conversation,
can hardly understand them better than if they
spoke a foreign language, and might, indeed, easily,
suppose this to be the case. The strange words and
pronunciations, and frequent abbreviations, disguise the
familiar features of one's native tongue, while the rhythmical
modulations, so characteristic of certain European
languages, give it an utterly un-English sound.
After six months' residence among them, there were
scholars in my school, among the most constant in attendance,
whom I could not understand at all, unless
they happened to speak very slowly.</p>
            <pb n="xxv"/>
            <p>With these people the process of “phonetic decay”
appears to have gone as far, perhaps, as is possible, and
with it an extreme simplification of etymology and syntax.
There is, of course, the usual softening of <hi rend="italics">th</hi> and <hi rend="italics">v</hi>, or
<hi rend="italics">f</hi>, into <hi rend="italics">d</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b</hi>; likewise a frequent interchange of <hi rend="italics">v</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">w</hi>, as <hi rend="italics">veeds</hi> and <hi rend="italics">vell</hi> for <hi rend="italics">weeds</hi> and <hi rend="italics">well</hi>; <hi rend="italics">woices</hi> and <hi rend="italics">punkin
wine</hi>, for <hi rend="italics">voices</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pumpkin vine</hi>. “De wile'
(<hi rend="italics">vilest</hi>) sinner may return” (No. 48). This last example
illustrates also their constant habit of clipping words and
syllables, as <hi rend="italics">lee' bro,' </hi>for <hi rend="italics">little brother</hi>; <hi rend="italics">plänt'shun</hi>, for
<hi rend="italics">plantation</hi>. The lengthening of short vowels is illustrated
in both these (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>, for instance, rarely has its short
English sound). “Een (in) dat mornin' all day” (No. 56).</p>
            <p>Strange words are less numerous in their <hi rend="italics">patois</hi> than
one would suppose, and, few as they are, most of them
maybe readily derived from English words. Besides the
familiar <hi rend="italics">buckra</hi>, and a few proper names, as Cuffy, Quash,
and perhaps Cudjo, I only know of <hi rend="italics">churray</hi> (spill), which
may be “throw 'way;” <hi rend="italics">oona</hi> or <hi rend="italics">ona</hi>, “you” (both singular
and plural, and used only for friends), as “Ona build a
house in Paradise” ( No. 40); and <hi rend="italics">aw</hi>, a kind of expletive,
equivalent to “to be sure,” as, “Dat clot' cheap.” “Cheap
aw.” “Dat Monday one lazy boy.” “Lazy aw—I 'bleege
to lick 'em.”</p>
            <p>Corruptions are more abundant. The most common
of them are these: <hi rend="italics">Yearde</hi> (hear), as in Nos. 3, etc.
“Flora, did you see that cat?” “No ma'am, but I
yearde him holler.” “<hi rend="italics">Sh'um</hi>,” a corruption of <hi rend="italics">see 'em</hi>,
applied (as <hi rend="italics">'em</hi> is) to all genders and both numbers.
<pb n="xxvi"/>
“Wan' to see how Beefut (Beaufort) stan'—nebber
sh'um since my name Adam.” <hi rend="italics">Huddy</hi> (how-do?), pronounced
<hi rend="italics">how-dy</hi> by purists, is the common term of greeting,
as in the song No. 20, “Tell my Jesus huddy O.”
“Bro' (brother) Quash sen' heap o' howdy.” <hi rend="italics">Studdy</hi>,
(steady) is used to denote any continued or customary
action. “He studdy 'buse an' cuss we,” was
the complaint entered by some little children against a
large girl. “I studdy talk hard, but you no yearde me,”
was Rina's defence when I reproved her for not speaking
loud enough. When we left, we were told that we must
“studdy come back.” Here, however, it seems to mean
<hi rend="italics">steady.</hi>
               <hi rend="italics">Titty</hi> is used for mother or oldest sister; thus,
Titty Ann was the name by which the children of our
man-of-all work knew their mother, Ann. <hi rend="italics">Sic-a</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">sake-a</hi>, possibly a condensation of <hi rend="italics">same</hi> and <hi rend="italics">like.</hi> “Him
an' me grow up sic-a brudder an' sister.” <hi rend="italics">Enty</hi> is a
curious corruption, I suppose of <hi rend="italics">ain't he</hi>, used like our
“Is that so?” in reply to a statement that surprises one.
“Robert, you have n't written that very well.” “Enty,
sir?” “John, it's going to rain to-day.” “Enty, sir?”
<hi rend="italics">Day-clean</hi> is used for <hi rend="italics">day-break</hi>. “Do, day-clean, for let
me go see Miss Ha'yet; and de day wouldn't clean.” <hi rend="italics">Sun-up</hi>
is also common. <hi rend="italics">Chu'</hi> for “this” or “that there;” as
“Wha' chu?” “See one knife chu?” <hi rend="italics">Say</hi> is used very
often, especially in singing, as a kind of expletive;
“(Say) when you get to heaven (say) you 'member me.”
(No. 27.) “Ain't you know say cotton de-de?” In the
last sentence “de-de” (accent on first syllable) means
<pb n="xxvii"/>
“is there;”—the first <hi rend="italics">de</hi>, a corruption of <hi rend="italics">does</hi> for <hi rend="italics">is</hi>, will
be explained presently; the other is a very common form
for <hi rend="italics">dere</hi>, there.</p>
            <p>I do not remember any other peculiar words, but
several words used peculiarly. <hi rend="italics">Cuss</hi> is used with great
latitude, to denote any offensive language. “Him cuss
me 'git out.” “Ahvy (Abby) do cuss me,” was the
serious-sounding, but trifling accusation made by a little
girl against her seat-mate. <hi rend="italics">Stan'</hi> is a very common
word, in the sense of <hi rend="italics">look.</hi> “My back stan' like white
man,” was a boast which meant that it was not scarred
with the lash. “Him stan' splendid, ma'am,” of the
sitting of a dress. I asked a group of boys one day
the color of the sky. Nobody could tell me. Presently
the father of one of them came by, and I told him their
ignorance, repeating my question with the same result
as before. He grinned: “Tom, how sky stan'?”
“Blue,” promptly shouted Tom. <hi rend="italics">Both</hi> they seldom use;
generally “all-two,” or emphatically, “all-two boff togedder.”
<hi rend="italics">One</hi> for <hi rend="italics">alone.</hi> “Me one, and God,” answered
an old man in Charleston to the question whether he escaped
alone from his plantation. “Gone home one in
de dark,” for alone. “Heab'n 'nuff for me one” (<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>, I
suppose, “for my part”), says one of their songs (No. 46.)
<hi rend="italics">Talk</hi> is one of their most common words, where we
should use <hi rend="italics">speak</hi> or <hi rend="italics">mean.</hi> “Talk me, sir?” asks a boy
who is not sure whether you mean him or his comrade.
“Talk lick, sir? nuffin but lick,” was the answer
when I asked whether a particular master used to
<pb n="xxviii"/>
whip his slaves. <hi rend="italics">Call</hi> is used to express relationship
as, “he call him aunt.” <hi rend="italics">Draw</hi>, for receiving in any
way—derived from the usage of drawing a specific
amount of supplies at stated times. “Dey draw
letter,“ was the remark when a mail arrived and
was distributed among us whites. <hi rend="italics">Meet</hi> is used in the
sense of <hi rend="italics">find.</hi> “I meet him here an' he remain wid me,”
was the cook's explanation when a missing chair was
found in the kitchen. When I remarked upon the
absurdity of some agricultural process—“I meet 'em so
an' my fader meet 'em so,” was the sufficient answer. A
grown man, laboring over the mysteries of simple addition,
explained the gigantic answer he had got by “I
meet two row, and I set down two.” “I meet you dere,
sir,” said Miller frankly, when convinced in an argument.
Too <hi rend="italics">much</hi> is the common adverb for a high degree of a
quality; “he bad <hi rend="italics">too</hi> much” was the description of a hard
master. <hi rend="italics">Gang</hi>, for any large number; “a whole gang of
slate-pencils.” <hi rend="italics">Mash</hi> in the sense of crush; “mammy
mash 'em,” when the goat had killed one of her kids by
lying on it. <hi rend="italics">Sensibble</hi> and <hi rend="italics">hab sense</hi> are favorite expressions.
A scholar would ask me to make him “sensibble”
of a thing. “Nebber sh'um since I hab sense” (<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>, since
I was old enough to know). <hi rend="italics">Stantion</hi> (substantial) was
a favorite adjective at Coffin's Point. <hi rend="italics">Strain</hi> is also a
favorite word. “Dem boy strain me,” explained Billy,
when some younger boys were attempting to <hi rend="italics">base</hi> him.
“I don't want to give more nor fifty-five dollar for a
horse,” said Quash, “but if dey strain you, you may
give fifty-six.” “Dat tune <hi rend="italics">so</hi> strainful,” said Rose.</p>
            <pb n="xxix"/>
            <p>The letters <hi rend="italics">n</hi>, <hi rend="italics">r</hi> and <hi rend="italics">y</hi> are used euphonically. “He
de baddes' little gal from y'ere to n'Europe,” said Bristol
of his troublesome niece Venus; “ought to put him
on a bar'l, an' den he fall 'sleep an' fall down an' hut
heself, an' dat make him more sensibble.” “He n'a
comin', sir,” was often said of a missing scholar. At first,
I took the <hi rend="italics">n</hi> for a negative. I set Gib one day to picking
out <hi rend="italics">E's</hi> from a box of letters. He could not distinguish
<hi rend="italics">E</hi> from <hi rend="italics">F</hi>, and at last, discouraged with his repeated
failures, explained, holding out an <hi rend="italics">F</hi>, “dis y'ere
stan' sic-a-r-<hi rend="italics">um</hi>.” (This looks like that.) It is suggested
also that <hi rend="italics">d</hi> is used in the same way, in “He d'a
comin';” and <hi rend="italics">s</hi>, in singing for instance, “'Tis wells and
good” (No. 25). So the vowel <hi rend="italics">a</hi>; “De foxes have-a
hole” (No. 2), “Heaven bell a-ring” (No. 27).</p>
            <p>The most curious of all their linguistic peculiarities
is perhaps the following. It is well known that the
negroes in all parts of the South speak of their elders as
“uncle” and “aunt,—”<ref n="12" rend="sc" target="note12">∗</ref>
               <note n="12" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref12">
                  <p>∗ In South Carolina “daddy” and “maum” are more common.</p>
               </note>
from a feeling of politeness,
I do not doubt; it seemed disrespectful to use the bare
name, and from <hi rend="italics">Mr.</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Mrs.</hi> they were debarred. On
the Sea Islands a similar feeling has led to the use of
<hi rend="italics">cousin</hi> towards their equals. Abbreviating this, after
their fashion, they get <hi rend="italics">co'n</hi> or <hi rend="italics">co'</hi> (the vowel sound <hi rend="italics">u</hi> as
in <hi rend="italics">cousin</hi>) as the common title when they speak of one
another; as, C'Abram, Co' Robin, Co'n Emma, C'Isaac,
Co'Bob. <hi rend="italics">Bro'</hi> (brother) and <hi rend="italics">Si'</hi> (sister) and even <hi rend="italics">T'</hi> (Titty)
<pb n="xxx"/>
are also often used in the same way; as, Bro' Paris,
Si' Rachel, T' Jane. A friend insists that <hi rend="italics">Cudjo</hi> is
nothing but Co' Joe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Where</hi> and <hi rend="italics">when</hi> are hardly used, at least by the
common class of negroes. The question “Where did
you spill the milk?” was answered only with a stare;
but “which way milk churray?” brought a ready response.
“What side you stayin', sir?” was one of the
first questions put to me. Luckily I had been initiated,
and was able to answer it correctly.</p>
            <p>There is probably no speech that has less inflection,
or indeed less power of expressing grammatical relation
in any way. It is perhaps not too strong to say that the
field-hands make no distinction of gender, case, number,
tense, or voice. The pronouns are to be sure distinguished
more or less by the more intelligent among
them, and all of these, unless perhaps <hi rend="italics">us</hi>, are occasionally
heard. <hi rend="italics">She</hi> is rare; <hi rend="italics">her</hi> still more so; <hi rend="italics">him</hi> being
commonly used for the third person singular of all cases
and genders; <hi rend="italics">'em</hi>, if my memory serves me rightly, only
for the objective case, but for all genders and both numbers.
<hi rend="italics">He</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">'e</hi>, is, I should think, most common as
possessive. “Him lick we” might mean a girl as well
as a boy. Thus <hi rend="italics">we</hi> is distinguished from <hi rend="italics">I</hi> or <hi rend="italics">me</hi>, and
<hi rend="italics">dey</hi> or <hi rend="italics">dem</hi> from <hi rend="italics">him</hi> or <hi rend="italics">dat</hi>; and these are, I think, the
only distinctions made in number. “Dat cow,” is singular,
“dem cow” plural; “Sandy hat” would mean indifferently
Sandy's hat or hats; “nigger-house” means
the collection of negro-houses, and is, I suppose, really a
plural.</p>
            <pb n="xxxi"/>
            <p>I do not know that I ever heard a real possessive case,
but they have begun to develop one of their own, which
is a very curious illustration of the way inflectional forms
grow up. If they wish to make the fact of possession
at all emphatic or distinct, they use the word “own.”
Thus, they will say “Mosey house,” but if asked whose
house that is, the answer is “Mosey own.” “Co' Molsy
y'own ” was the odd reply made by Mylie to the question
whose child she was carrying. Literally translated,
this is “Molsy's;” <hi rend="italics">Co'</hi> is title, <hi rend="italics">y</hi> euphonic. An officer
of a colored regiment standing by me when the answer
was made—himself born a slave—confessed that it was
mere gibberish to him. No doubt this custom would in
time develop a regular inflectional possessive; but the
establishment of schools will soon root up all these original
growths.</p>
            <p>Very commonly, in verbs which have strong conjugations,
the forms of the past tense are used for the present;
“What make you leff we?” “I tuk dem brudder”
(No. 30). Past time is expressed by <hi rend="italics">been</hi>, and less
commonly <hi rend="italics">done</hi>. “I been kep him home two day,” was
the explanation given for a daughter's absence from
school. “I done pit my crap in de groun'.” Present
time is made definite by the auxiliary <hi rend="italics">do</hi> or <hi rend="italics">da</hi>, as in the
refrains “Bell da ring,” “Jericho da worry me.” (Nos.
46, 47). “Bubber (brother) da hoe he tater.” So <hi rend="italics">did</hi>
occasionally: “Nat did cuss me,” complained one boy of
another. It is too much to say that the verbs have no
inflections, but it is true that these have nearly disappeared.
<pb n="xxxii"/>
Ask a boy where he is going, and the answer
is “gwine crick for ketch crab” (going into the creek
to catch crabs); ask another where the missing boy is,
and the answer is the same, with <hi rend="italics">gone</hi> instead of <hi rend="italics">gwine.</hi>
The hopeless confusion between auxiliaries is sometimes
very entertaining: as “de-de,” “ain't you know?” “I
didn't been.” “De Lord is perwide” (No. 2). “You'd
better pray, de worl' da [is] gwine” (No. 14). “My
stomach been-a da hut me.”</p>
            <p>Some of these sentences illustrate two other peculiarities—the omission of auxiliaries and other small words,
and the use of <hi rend="italics">for</hi> as the sign of the infinitive. “Unky
Taff call Co' Flora for drop tater.” “Good for hold comb”
was the wisest answer found to the teacher's question
what their ears were good for. “Co' Benah wan' Mr.—
for tuk 'em down,” was Gib's whispered comment when
the stubborn Venus refused to step down from a bench.
After school the two were discovered at fisticuffs, and on
being called to account—“dat same Benah dah knock me,”
said Gib, while Venus retorted with “Gib cuss me in
school.”</p>
            <p>It is owing to this habit of dropping auxiliaries that
the passive is rarely if ever indicated. You ask a man's
name, and are answered, “Ole man call John.” “Him
mix wid him own fät,” was the description given of a
paste made of bruised ground-nuts, the oil of the nut
furnishing moisture. “I can't certain,” “The door didn't
fasten,” “The bag won't full,” “Dey frighten in de dark,”
are illustrations of every-day usage.</p>
            <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            <p>Proper names furnish many curious illustrations of
the corruption in pronunciation. Many of them are impossible
to explain, and it is still only a surmise that
<hi rend="italics">Finnick</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italics">Phoenix</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">Wyna</hi> from <hi rend="italics">Malvina</hi>
(the first syllable being dropped, as in <hi rend="italics">'Nelius</hi> for
<hi rend="italics">Cornelius</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">'Rullus</hi> for <hi rend="italics">Marullus</hi>.) <hi rend="italics">Hacless</hi> is unquestionably
<hi rend="italics">Hercules</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">Sack</hi> no doubt <hi rend="italics">Psyche</hi>; <hi rend="italics">Strappan</hi>
is supposed to be <hi rend="italics">Strephon</hi>. All these are common
names on the Sea Islands. Names of trades, as <hi rend="italics">Miller</hi>,
<hi rend="italics">Butcher</hi>, are not uncommon. One name that I heard of,
but did not myself meet with, was <hi rend="italics">After-dark</hi>, so called
because he was so black that “you can't sh'um 'fo' day-clean.”</p>
            <p>In conclusion, some actual specimens of talk, illustrating
the various points spoken of, may not be without
interest. A scene at the opening of school:<ref n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">∗</ref>
               <note n="13" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref13">
                  <p>∗ It is proper to state that most of the materials for this scene were furnished by Mr. Arthur Sumner, which accounts for the similarity of certain of the expressions to those in the dialogue given in the September number of the Boston <hi rend="italics">Freedman's Record.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>“Charles, why did n't you come to school earlier?”
“A-could n't come <hi rend="italics">soon</hi> to-day, sir; de boss he sheer out
clo' dis mornin'.” “What did he give you?” “Me,sir?
I ain't <hi rend="italics">git</hi>; de boss he de baddest buckra ebber a-see.
De morest part ob de mens dey git heaps o' clo'—more'n
'nuff; 'n I ain't git nuffin.” “Were any other children
there?” “Plenty chil'n, sir. All de chil'n dah fo' sun-up.”
“January, you have n't brought your book.” “ I
<hi rend="italics">is</hi>, sir; sh'um here, sir?” “Where is Juno?” “I ain't
<pb n="xxxiv"/>
know where he gone, sir.” “Where is Sam?” “He
didn't been here.” “Where is the little boy, John?”
“He pick up he foot and run.” A new scholar is
brought: “Good mornin', maussa; I bring dis same chile
to school, sir: <hi rend="italics">do</hi> don't let 'em stay arter school done.
Here you, gal, stan' up an' say howdy to de genlmn. Do
maussa lash 'em well ef he don't larn he lesson.” “Where's
your book, Tom?” “Dunno, sir. Some<hi rend="italics">body</hi> mus' a tief
'em.” “Where's your brother?” “Sh'um dar? wid
bof he han' in he pocket?” “Billy, have you done your
sum?” “Yes, sir, I out 'em.” “Where's Polly?”
“Polly de-de.” Taffy comes up. “Please, sir, make me
sensibble of dat word—I want to ketch 'em werry bad,
sir, werry bad.” Hacless begins to read. He spells,
in a loud whisper,“g-o; g-o; g-o—can't fetch dat word,
sir, nohow.”</p>
            <p>The first day Gib appeared in school I asked him
whether he could read, and received a prompt answer in
the affirmative. So, turning to the first page of Willson's
Primer, I told him to read. The sentence was “I am
on,” or something of that sort, opposite a picture of a
boy on a rocking-horse. Gib attacked it with great
volubility, “h-r-s-e, horse. De boy is on top ob de
horse”—adding some remarks about a chair in the
background. His eye then fell on a picture of an eagle,
and without pausing he went on, “De raben is big bird.”
Next be passed to a lion on the opposite page, “D-o-g,
dog;” but just then a cut above, representing a man
and an ox, proved too strong for him, and he proceeded
<pb n="xxxv"/>
to give a detailed history of the man and the cow.
When this was completed, he took up a picture of a boy
with a paper soldiers' cap and a sword. “Dis man hab
sword; he tuk 'e sword an' cut 'e troat.” Here I checked
him, and found, as may be expected, that he did not
know a single letter.</p>
            <p>A scene at a government auction: Henry and Titus
are rivals, bidding for a piece of “secesh” furniture.
Titus begins with six dollars. “Well, Titus, I won't
strain you—eight.” “Seven,” says Titus. “Ten,” says
Henry. “Twelve,” says Titus. “And den,” said our
informant, “Henry bid fourteen an' tuk 'em for fifteen.”</p>
            <p>One Day when we returned from a row on the creek,
to make a call, Dick met us with his face on a grin:
“You seen him? you seen Miss T? <hi rend="italics">I</hi> seen him. I tole
him you gone wid intention call on she, but de boat
didn't ready in time. He cotch you at Mr. H., on'y de
horse bodder him at de gate.” One of the boys came
to me one day with the complaint, “Dem Ma' B. Fripp
chil'n fin' one we book,” <hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi>, those children from Mr. T.
B. Fripp's have found one of our books. “'E nebber
crack 'e bret,” <hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi>, say a word. “What make you
don't?” “Mr. P. didn't must.” “I don't know what
make I didn't answer.” “How do you do to-day?”
“Stirrin;” “spared,” “standin';” “out o' bed,”
(never “very well.”) Or, of a friend, “He feel a lee better'n
he been, ma'am.”</p>
            <p>“Arter we done chaw all de hard bones and swallow
all de bitter pills,” was part of a benediction; and the
<pb n="xxxvi"/>
prayer at a “praise-meeting” asked “dat all de white
bredren an' sister what jine praise wid we to-night might
be bound up in de belly-band ob faith.” At a funeral
in a colored regiment: “One box o' dead meat gone to
de grave to-day—who gwine to-morrow? Young man,
who walk so stiff—ebery step he take seem like he say,
‘Look out dah, groun’, I da comin'.” The following is
Strappan's view of Love. “Arter you lub, you lub, you
know, boss. You can't broke lub. Man can't broke lub.
Lub stan'—'e ain't gwine broke. Man hab to be berry
smart for broke lub. Lub is a ting stan' jus' like tar;
arter he stick, he stick, he ain't gwine move. He can't
move less dan you burn him. Hab to kill all two arter
he lub 'fo' you broke lub.”</p>
            <p>It would be an interesting, and perhaps not very difficult
inquiry, to determine how far the peculiarities of
speech of the South Carolina negroes result from the
large Huguenot element in the settlement of that State.
It would require, however, a more exact acquaintance
than I possess with the dialects of other portions of the
South, to form a judgment of any value upon this point.
Meanwhile, I will say only that two usages have struck me
as possibly arising from this source, the habitual lengthening
of vowel sounds, and the pronunciation of <hi rend="italics">Maussa</hi>,
which may easily have been derived from <hi rend="italics">Monsieur</hi>.
After all, traces of Huguenot influence should by right
be found among the whites, even more than the blacks.</p>

friendly encouragement and for direct and indirect contributions
to their original stock of songs. From first
to last he has manifested the kindest interest in their
undertaking, constantly suggesting the names of persons
likely to afford them information, and improving every
opportunity to procure them material. As soon as his
own valuable collection had appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Atlantic

which was promptly confirmed by his publishers, Messrs.

            <head>DIRECTIONS FOR SINGING.</head>
            <p>IN addition to those already given in the Introduction, the following explanations may be of assistance:</p>
            <p>Where all the words are printed with the music, there will probably be little difficulty in reading the songs; but where there are other words printed below the music it will often be a question to which part of the tune these words belong, and how the refrain and the chorus are to be brought in.</p>
            <p>It will be noticed that the words of most of the songs arrange themselves into stanzas of four lines each. Of these some are <hi rend="italics">refrain</hi>, and some are <hi rend="italics">verse</hi> proper. The most common arrangement gives the second and fourth lines, to the refrain, and the first and third to the verse; and in this case the third line may be a repetition of the first, or may have different words. Often, however, the refrain occupies only one line, the verse occupying the other three; while in one or two songs the verse is only one line, while the refrain is three lines in length. The refrain is repeated with each stanza: the words of the verse are changed at the pleasure of the leader, or fugleman, who sings either well-known words, or, if he is gifted that way, invents verses as the song goes on.</p>
            <p>In addition to the stanza, some of the songs have a chorus, which usually consists of a fixed set of words, though in some of the songs the chorus is a good deal varied. The refrain of the main stanza often appears in the chorus. The stanza can always be distinguished from the chorus, in those songs which have more than one stanza, by the figure “1” placed before the stanza which is printed with the music; the verses below being numbered on “2,” “3,” “4,” &amp;c. In a few cases the first verse below the music is numbered “3;” this occurs when two verses have been printed above in the music, instead of the first verse being repeated. When the chorus has a variety of words, the additional verses are printed below without numbers. </p>
            <p>In the following list the first fifty tunes in the collection are classified according
<pb n="xliv"/>
to the peculiarity of their division into verse and refrain. It is hoped that this will help to remove all obscurities with which the reader may be embarrassed.</p>
            <p>No explanation is needed for Nos. 2, 12, 13, 18, 22-26, 34, 36, 38-43.</p>
            <p>Single line and refrain, 27, 35.</p>
            <p>Single line and refrain with chorus, 6, 29.</p>
            <p>Stanza of 4 lines:</p>
            <p>No refrain; chorus, 11.</p>
            <p>4th line refrain; introduction, 7</p>
            <p>4th line refrain; chorus, 8, 9, 10, 15, 37, 45.</p>
            <p>1st and 2d lines verse, 3d and 4th refrain; chorus, 1, 4.</p>
            <p>1st and 3d lines verse, 2d and 4th refrain, 14, 17, 20, 28, 31, 32, 33, 47, 48, 49, 50.</p>
            <p>1st and 3d lines verse, 2d and 4th refrain; double, 21.</p>
            <p>1st and 3d lines verse, 2d and 4th refrain; chorus, 3, 30, 44.</p>
            <p>1st and 3d lines verse, 2d and 4th refrain; introduction, 46.</p>
            <p>1st line verse; chorus, 5.</p>
            <p>1st line verse; (double); chorus, 19.</p>
            <p>3d line verse, 16.</p>
            <p>As regards the <hi rend="italics">tempo</hi>, most of the tunes are in 2-4 time, and in most of these [quarter note] = 100—(say)100-120. The spirit of the music will determine the <hi rend="italics">tempo</hi> within these limits. The slower tunes are 1, 3, 9, 17, 21, etc. No. 2 is about [quarter note] = 160-180, and perhaps had better have been written in 3-8. So No. 13 would be better in 2-4; as it is, the [quarter note] = 160-170. No. 24 should be read as if divided in 2-4, with [quarter note] = 100. The <hi rend="italics">tempo</hi> of the rowing tunes has been already indicated.</p>
            <p>The pitch has generally been accommodated to voices of medium range.</p>

                  <p>[The last verse is varied in several different ways; Col. Higginson gives, “There's a hill on my leff, an' he catch on my right,” and says, “I could get no explanation of this last riddle, except, ‘Dat mean, if you go on de leff, you go to 'struction, and if you go on de right, go to God, for sure.’ ” Miss Forten gives, “I hop on my right an' I catch on my leff,” and supposes “that some peculiar motion of the body formed the original accompaniment of the song, but has now fallen into disuse.” Lt. Col. Trowbridge heard this hymn sung among the colored people of Brooklyn, N. Y., several years ago.]</p>

                  <p>[“‘De valley,’ and ‘de lonesome valley’ were familiar words in their religious experience. To descend into that region implied the same process with the ‘anxious-seat’ of the camp-meeting. When a young girl was supposed to enter it, she bound a handkerchief by a peculiar knot over her head, and made it a point of honor not to change a single garment till the day of her baptism, so that she was sure of being in physical readiness for the cleansing rite, whatever her spiritual mood might be. More than once, in noticing a damsel thus mystically kerchiefed, I have asked some dusky attendant its meaning, and have received the unfailing answer,—framed with their usual indifference to the genders of pronouns,—“He in de lonesome valley, sa.' ”—<hi rend="italics">Col.

                  <p>Lt. Col. Trowbridge is of opinion that it was brought from Florida, as he first heard it in Dec, 1862, from a boat-load of Florida soldiers brought up by Lt. Col. Billings. It was not heard by Mr. Ware at Coffin's Point until that winter. It seems hardly likely, however, that it could have made its way to Charleston and Edgefield since that time. The air became “immensely popular” in the regiment, and was soon adopted for military purposes, so that the class leaders indignantly complained of “the drum corps using de Lord's chune.”]</p>

                  <p>The regularity and elaborateness of this hymn lead one at first to suspect its genuineness. The question seems, however, to be settled by two very interesting and undoubted variations from North Carolina and Georgia. The following words were sung at Augusta, but we have not been able to obtain the tune, which is entirely unlike that given above. For the North Carolina variation, see No. 100. Both, as will be seen, omit the second part, and a comparison of the two shows that the enigmatical word “order” should undoubtedly be “altar” The North Carolina tune has the first part quite different from the Port Royal tune, the last very similar to it.</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>[This is probably the song heard by W. H. Russell, of the London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi>, as described in chapter xviii. of “My Diary North and South.” The writer was on his way from Pocotaligo to Mr. Trescot's estate on Barnwell Island, and of the midnight row thither he says:</p>
                  <p>“The oarsmen, as they bent to their task, beguiled the way by singing in unison a real negro melody, which was unlike the works of the Ethiopian Serenaders as anything in song could be unlike another. It was a barbaric sort of madrigal, in which one singer beginning was followed by the others in unison, repeating the refrain in chorus, and full of quaint expression and melancholy:—</p>
                  <lg type="stanza" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">‘O your soul! oh my soul! I'm going to the churchyard</l>

                     <l part="N">Oh my soul! oh your soul! we're going to the churchyard</l>
                     <l part="N">To lay this nigger down.’</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>And then some appeal to the difficulty of passing the ‘Jawdam’ constituted the whole of the song, which continued with unabated energy during the whole of the little voyage. To me it was a strange scene. The stream, dark as Lethe, flowing between the silent, houseless, rugged banks, lighted up near the landing by the fire in the woods, which reddened the sky—the wild strain, and the unearthly adjurations to the singers' souls, as though they were palpable, put me in mind of the fancied voyage across the Styx.”</p>
                  <p>We append with some hesitation the following as a variation; the words of which we borrow from Col. Higginson. Lt. Col Trowbridge says of it that it was sung at funerals in the night time—one of the most solemn and characteristic of the customs of the negroes. He attributes its origin to St. Simon's Island, Georgia:]</p>

Higginson, “<hi rend="italics">Becky Martin</hi> was, and why she should or should not be wet, and whether the dryness was a reward or a penalty, none could say. I got the impression that, in either case, the event was posthumous, and that there was some tradition of grass not growing over the grave of a sinner; but even this was vague, and all else vaguer.”</p>
                  <p>Lt. Col. Trowbridge heard a story that “<hi rend="italics">Peggy Norton</hi> was an old prophetess, who said that it would not do to be baptized except when it rained; if the Lord

was pleased with those who had been ‘in the wilderness,’ he would send rain.” Mr. Tomlinson says that the song always ends with a laugh, and appears therefore to be regarded by the negroes as mere nonsense. He adds that when it is used as a rowing tune, at the words “Rack back holy!” one rower reaches over back and slaps the man behind him, who in turn does the same, and so on.]</p>

                  <p>Col. Higginson suggests that this refrain may have originated in Virginia, and gone South with our army, because “‘done’ is a Virginia shibboleth, quite distinct from the ‘been’ which replaces it in South Carolina. In the proper South Carolina dialect, would have been substituted ‘De bell been-a ring.’” We have, however, shown in the preface, that “done” is used on St. Helena; and at any rate the very general use of this refrain there in the present tense, “Bell da ring,” would indicate that it was of local origin, while we have never met with anything at all like it in any other part of the country. As given above, it is one of the most characteristic “shouting” tunes.</p>
                  <p>In singing “Heaven-bell a heaven-bell,” the <hi rend="italics">v</hi> and <hi rend="italics">n</hi> were so run together that the words sounded like “hum-bell a hum-bell,” with strong emphasis and dwelling upon the <hi rend="italics">m</hi>.]</p>

Sometimes the leading singer would simply repeat the words, mornfully: “Die, die, die,”—sometimes he would interpolate such an inappropriate line as “Jump along, jump along dere.”]</p>

                  <p>[This song was a favorite in the colored schools of Charleston in 1865; it has since that time spread to the Sea Islands, where it is now sung with the variation noted above. An independent transcription of this melody, sent from Florida by Lt. Col. Apthorp, differed only in the ictus of certain measures, as has also been noted above. The third verse was furnished by Lt. Col. Apthorp. Once when there had been a good deal of ill feeling excited, and trouble was apprehended, owing to the uncertain action of Government in regard to the confiscated lands on the Sea Islands, Gen. Howard was called upon to address the colored people earnestly and even severely. Sympathizing with them, however, he could not speak to his own satisfaction; and to relieve their minds of the ever-present sense of injustice, and prepare them to listen, he asked them to sing.

                  <p>[This “infinitely quaint description of the length of the heavenly road,” as Col. Higginson styles it, is one of the most peculiar and wide-spread of the spirituals.  It was sung as given above in Caroline Co., Virginia, and probably spread southward from this State, variously modified in different localities. “My body rock 'long fever,” (No. 45,) would hardly be recognized as the same, either by words or tune, and yet it is almost certainly the same, as is shown by the following, sung in Augustua, Georgia, which has some of the words of the present song, adapted to a tune which is unmistakably identical with No. 45.] </p>

The irregularity probably arises from omission of rests, but it seemed a hopeless undertaking to attempt to restore the correct time, and it was thought best to give it in this shape as at any rate a characteristic specimen of negro singing.

                  <p>[This is a favorite and apparently genuine song which “flourishes” in a colored church at Auburn, N. Y. having been introduced there from the South. “It is sung on <hi rend="italics">all</hi> occasions, and without any regard to <hi rend="italics">order</hi> in the verses; you may not be able to see any connection between any of them. The chorus is always sung once or twice before the verses are used at all. You will see that occasionally there is inserted an extra syllable (ah) and always in the 2nd and 4th lines of the verses; why this is done I am unable to discover, but it appears to assist them wonderfully in singing. The first note in the chorus is sung very <hi rend="italics">loud</hi>, and is prolonged to an indefinite time, at the pleasure of the leader. You will notice that the air is in the minor mode, but the chorus, with the exception of the last line, in the major.”—W. A. B.]</p>

                  <p>[The seven foregoing songs were obtained from a lady who heard them sung, before the war, on the “Good Hope” plantation, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. The language, evidently a rude corruption of French, is that spoken by the negroes in that part of the State; and it is said that it is more difficult for persons who speak French to interpret this dialect, than for those who speak English to understand the most corrupt of the ordinary negro-talk. The pronunciation of this negro-French is indicated, as accurately as possible, in the versions given here, which furnish, also, many interesting examples of the peculiar phrases and idioms employed by this people. The frequent omission of prepositions, articles, and auxiliary verbs, as well as of single letters, and the contractions constantly occurring, are among the most noticeable peculiarities. Some of the most difficult words are: <hi rend="italics">

                  <p>Four of these songs. Nos. 130, 131, 132 and 133, were sung to a simple dance, a sort of minuet called the <hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">Coonjai</foreign>
                     </hi>; the name and the dance are probably both of African origin. When the <hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">Coonjai</foreign>
                     </hi> is danced, the music is furnished by an orchestra of singers, the leader of whom—a man selected both for the quality of his voice and for his skill in improvising—sustains the solo part, while the others afford him an opportunity, as they shout in chorus, for inventing some neat verse to compliment some lovely <hi rend="italics">
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">danseuse</foreign>
                     </hi>, or celebrate the deeds of some plantation hero. The dancers themselves never sing, as in the case of the religious “shout” of the Port Royal negroes; and the usual musical accompaniment, besides that of the singers, is that furnished by a skilful performer on the barrel-head-drum, the jaw-bone and key, or some other rude instrument.</p>
                  <p>No. 134. The “<foreign xml:lang="fre">calinda</foreign>” was a sort of contra-dance, which has now passed entirely out of use. Bescherelle describes the two lines as <foreign xml:lang="fre">“avançant et reculant en cadence, et faisant des contorsions for singulières et des gestes fort lascifs.”</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first movement of No. 135, “<foreign xml:lang="fre">Lolotte,</foreign>” has furnished M. Gottschalk with the theme of his “<hi rend="italics">Ballade Créole,</hi>” “<hi rend="italics">La Savane,</hi>” op. 3 <foreign xml:lang="fre">de la Louisiane.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>In 136, we have the attempt of some enterprising negro to write a French song; he is certainly to be congratulated on his success.</p>
                  <p>It will be noticed that all these songs are “seculars”; and that while the words of most of them are of very little account, the music is as peculiar, as interesting, and, in the case of two or three of them, as difficult to write down, or to sing correctly, as any that have preceded them.]</p>

            <head>EDITORS' NOTE.</head>
            <p>The original arrangement of the foregoing collection has not been adhered to. Why the secular songs do not appear by themselves has been already explained. That the division into parts is not strictly geographical was caused by the tardy arrival of most of the songs contained in Part IV. Should a second edition ever be justified by the favor with which the present is received, these irregularities will be corrected.</p>
            <p>It was proposed to print music without words, and words without music, each by themselves. But the first can hardly be said to have been obtained, unless “Shock along, John,” No. 86, is an instance. The words without music which in one or two cases were kindly, and we fear laboriously, communicated to us, presented no fresh or striking peculiarities, and we therefore decided against their admission.</p>
            <p>As was remarked in the Introduction, we are fully aware of the incompleteness of this collection, though we may fairly enough assume it to be <hi rend="italics">
                  <foreign xml:lang="fre">la crême de la crême.</foreign>
               </hi> Col Higginson writes:</p>
            <p>“I wish you would look up one ‘spiritual,’ of which I only remember the chorus—‘<hi rend="italics">It doth appear</hi>’—as being often sung in camp. Also, ‘<hi rend="italics">Ring dat charming bell</hi>,’ which they used to sing to please Mrs. Saxton, who liked it”</p>
            <p>Gen. James H. Wilson, who, in the earlier part of the war, was at Port Royal, and, during explorations and night surveys of the coast between there and Ossabaw Sound, had frequent opportunities of hearing every grade of “spirituals,” writes, of Col. Higginson's collection in the <hi rend="italics">Atlantic Monthly</hi>:</p>
            <p>“He has omitted two which I heard more generally sung than any others. I refer to the one beginning:
<quote>
                  <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“ ‘They took ole Master Lord,</l>
                     <l part="N">And fed him on pepper and gall,’</l>
                  </lg>
               </quote>
and the other:
<quote>
                  <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“ ‘My brudder Johnny's new-born baby,</l>
                     <l part="N">Hi oh, de new-born!’</l>
                  </lg>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>“The airs to which these were sung are very peculiar, while the burthen of the songs is pretty clearly indicated by the lines given above. The first seems to allude to the persecutions of Christ, while the latter simply refers to the birth and early death of a new-born baby, and is varied by making a new verse for all the brothers and sisters that the singer happens to be able to call to mind.</p>
            <pb n="115"/>
            <p>“I also recollect the refrain of a boat-song which a crew of ten stalwart negroes used to sing for me in our excursions, but I am inclined to the belief that it was by no means a ‘spiritual,’ as I could never get any of them to explain it to my satisfaction. The only words I could make out clearly were:
<quote>
                  <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“ ‘Jah de window, jah!</l>
                     <l part="N">Oh jah de window,’ etc.</l>
                  </lg>
               </quote>
and the meaning of which I took to be ‘'jar the window.’ If they had any such thing among them, this was probably a fragment of a simple ballad, describing an incident in a negro courtship. I got this impression at the time, partly from the peculiar tone of the song, and partly from their hesitancy to explain it. But whatever may have been its real character, it was quite musical, and had such an inspiring effect upon my boatmen that I have known them to row eighteen or twenty miles, exerting their utmost strength, keeping perfect time to its notes, and never pausing for breath.”</p>
            <p>These, certainly, are songs to be desired and regretted. But we do not despair of recovering them and others perhaps equally characteristic for a second edition; and we herewith solicit the kind offices of collectors into whose hands this volume may have fallen, in extending and perfecting our researches. For fully a third of the songs recorded by Col. Higginson we have failed to obtain the music, and they may very well serve as a guide for future investigators. We shall also gratefully acknowledge any errors of fact or of typography that may be brought to our attention, and in general anything that would enhance the value or the interest of this collection.
