            <head>TO THE Right HONOURABLE, <lb/>
               <hi rend="italics">ROBERT HARLEY</hi>, Esq; <lb/> Speaker of the <hi rend="italics">H. of Commons</hi>, <lb/> AND <lb/> One of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State.</head>
            <p>I Flatter my self, that I am not without Reason, for imploring Your Protection of the following Discourse. It is an honest Account of the ancientest, as well as most profitable Colony, depending on the Crown of <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> and therefore ought naturally to address it self to the Patron of the <hi rend="italics">Plantations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Body is better instructed in the true Interest of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> than Your Self; No Body is more convinced,
<pb n="iii"/>
how much the <hi rend="italics">Plantations</hi> advance that Interest; and consequently, no Body knows how to set a juster Value upon them. While some People, upon very mistaken Principles of Policy, are for loading those Countries with heavy Impositions, and oppressing them with Rapacious, and Arbitrary Governours; You, <hi rend="italics">Sir,</hi> who are a better Judge of their Importance, are for milder Methods, and for extending the Blessings of Justice, and Property, to all the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>How happy therefore ought we of the <hi rend="italics">Plantations</hi> to think our selves, in the Favour of a Gentleman, whose Thoughts are directed by unbiass'd Reason, and the real Advantages of <hi rend="italics">England?</hi> Those are the Measures we wish to be govern'd by; and ask no other Treatment, than what is due to a loyal People, whose Lives are devoted to the Benefit of their Mother-Country. And sure we can never despair of this Common Justice, in the
<pb n="iv"/>
Reign of a Gracious Queen, who wishes the Happiness of all Her Subjects. <hi rend="italics">England</hi> is infinitely to be envy'd, for lying under the immediate Influences of Her Goodness: While the <hi rend="italics">Plantations,</hi> which are farther remov'd from Her Royal Presence, have those kindly Beams more weakly reflected on them. Their Distance makes 'em liable to be ill used by Men, that over-act Her Sacred Authority, and under-act Her Vertues. But we please our selves with the Hopes, that these Misfortunes will be made lighter to us, by the Justice of the present Administration.</p>
            <p>I must not presume to celebrate Your bright Qualities, because, next to having a great deal of Merit, the hardest Thing in the World, is to give it a just Commendation. You have by Your Publick Services, taken Care to convince Mankind of Your Worth. You alone have Abilities not only to fill, but to adorn, at the same
<pb n="v"/>
time, Two of the most important Posts of the Nation. You, <hi rend="italics">Sir,</hi> have reconcil'd the long Difference there has been betwixt the Patriot and the Publick Minister. And 'tis a plain Demonstration, that the QUEEN has no other View, than the Happiness of Her People, when Her Majesty is pleased to employ such Persons in Her Service, as have all along signaliz'd a constant Love to their Country.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">'TIS agreed, that Travellers are of all Men, the most suspected of Insincerity. This does not only hold, in their private Conversations; but likewise in the</hi> Grand Tours, <hi rend="italics">and Travels, with which they pester the Publick, and break the Bookseller. There are no Books, (the Legends of Saints always excepted,) so stuff'd with Poetical Stories, as Voyages; and the more distant the Countries lie, which they pretend to describe, the greater License those priviledg'd Authors take, in imposing upon the World. The</hi> French <hi rend="italics">Travels are commonly more infamous on this Account, than any other, which must be imputed to the strong Genius of that Nation to</hi> Hyperbole, <hi rend="italics">and</hi> Romance. <hi rend="italics">They are fond of dressing up every thing in their gay Fashion, from a happy Opinion, that their own</hi> Fopperies <hi rend="italics">make any Subject more entertaining. The</hi> English, <hi rend="italics">it must be granted, invent more within the Compass of Probability, and are contented to be less Ornamental, while they are more Sincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">I make no Question, but the following Account will come in for its Share of this Imputation. I</hi>
               <pb n="vii"/>
               <hi rend="italics">shall be reputed as arrant a Traveller as the rest, and my Credit, (like that of Women,) will be condemn'd for the Sins of my Company. However, I intreat the gentle Reader to be so just, as not to convict me upon bare Suspicion; let the Evidence be plain, or at least amount to a violent Presumption, and then I don't fear being acquitted. If an honest Author might be believ'd in his own Case, I wou'd solemnly declare, that I have not knowingly asserted any untrue Thing in the whole Book. On the contrary, I fear, I shall rather be accused of saying too much Truth, than too little. If I have had the Misfortune to have err'd in any Particular this Way, which yet I have used all imaginable Care to avoid, I hope the World, with all its Uncharitableness, will vouchsafe to forgive my Understanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">If I might be so happy, as to settle my Credit with the Reader, the next Favour I wou'd ask of him, shou'd be, not to Criticize too unmercifully upon my Stile. I am an</hi> Indian, <hi rend="italics">and don't pretend to be exact in my Language: But I hope the Plainness of my Dress, will give him the kinder Impressions of my Honesty, which is what I pretend to. Truth desires only to be understood, and never affects the Reputation of being finely equipp'd. It depends upon its own intrinsick Value, and, like Beauty, is rather conceal'd, than set off, by Ornament.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="viii"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">I wonder no Body has ever presented the World, with a tolerable Account of our</hi> Plantations. <hi rend="italics">Nothing of that kind has yet appear'd, except some few General Descriptions, that have been calculated more for the Benefit of the Bookseller, than for the Information of Mankind. If I may judge of the rest, by what has been publish'd concerning</hi> Virginia, <hi rend="italics">I will take the Liberty to say, that there's none of 'em either true, or so much as well invented. Such Accounts are as impertinent as ill Pictures, that resemble any Body, as much as the Persons they are drawn for. For my part, I have endeavour'd to hit the</hi> Likeness; <hi rend="italics">though, perhaps, my</hi> Colouring <hi rend="italics">may not have all the Life and Beauty I cou'd wish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">The Method I have taken in this Performance, is as follows. I have divided the Whole into Four distinct Parts. The first contains, a Chronological History, of the most remarkable Things that have happen'd in</hi> Virginia, <hi rend="italics">ever since it was first seated by the</hi> English. <hi rend="italics">It shows all the Wars with the</hi> Indians, <hi rend="italics">and their Causes, all the Massacres, and other Disasters, occasion'd by the Resentment of the Natives. It likewise gives a faithful Account, of all the successive Governours of that Country, and their Administration, together with the principal Laws, that have been enacted in the Time of Each. In the doing of which, I have been careful to mention nothing, but what I can make good by very Authentique</hi>
               <pb n="ix"/>
               <hi rend="italics">Testimony. So that if I have taken the Freedom, to represent the Mismanagements of several Gentlemen, it is their Fault, that acted such Irregularities, and not mine, that report them to the World. If Men will please to be unjust, run counter to the</hi> Royal Instructions, <hi rend="italics">oppress the People, and offer Violence to all the</hi> Laws <hi rend="italics">of a Country, they ought to be known, and abhorr'd by Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">The Second Part treats of the Spontaneous Productions of that Country, and the Original State, wherein the</hi> English <hi rend="italics">found it at their first Arrival. This is a very copious Subject, but I have handled it with more Brevity than it deserves, because I am conscious of my want of Skill in the</hi> Works of Nature. <hi rend="italics">However I flatter my self, that what I have said, will be sufficient, to give a Handle to a more compleat Undertaking. The World had some Years ago an unhappy Loss, by the Death of Mr.</hi> Banister, <hi rend="italics">who was making curious Collections for</hi> a Natural History of <hi rend="italics">Virginia: But the sudden Death of that Gentleman, put an End to that excellent Design. He had great Talents that Way, and if he had liv'd a few Years longer, he wou'd have done Justice to so fine a Country, by describing it in all its Native Perfections.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="x"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">The Third Part gives a true Account of the</hi> Indians, <hi rend="italics">together with their Religion, Customs, and Government. There I have added Fourteen Copper Plates, to illustrate the Dress, and Way of Living of the Natives, the Draughts of which were taken exactly from the Life. Herein, as well as throughout the whole Book, I have been very scrupulous, not to insert any thing, but what I can justifie, either by my own Knowledge, or by credible Information.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">In the Fourth Part, I have represented the</hi> English <hi rend="italics">Form of Government in that Country, with all the Publick Officers, their Business, and Salary. There I have mention'd many of their most material Laws, and Methods of proceeding. I have likewise shown the small Improvements, that the</hi> English <hi rend="italics">have made, since they have been in Possession, and pointed at several great Advantages, which they might secure to themselves, by a due Spirit of Industry, and Management. I have every-where made it my chief Business, to avoid</hi> Partiality; <hi rend="italics">and therefore have fairly expos'd the Inconveniencies, as well as proclaim'd the Excellencies of my Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="xi"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">This is the</hi> Bill of Fare, <hi rend="italics">of what the Reader may expect to meet with in the following Discourse; and I shou'd be very happy, if he wou'd have the Goodness, to think it a tolerable Entertainment.</hi>

                     <p>§.1. THE Learned and Valiant Sir <hi rend="italics">Walter Raleigh</hi> having entertain'd some deeper and more serious Considerations upon the State of the Earth, than most other Men of his Time, as may sufficiently
<pb n="2"/>
appear by his incomparable Book, <hi rend="italics">The History of the World:</hi> And having laid together the many Stories then in <hi rend="italics">Europe</hi> concerning <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> the Native Beauty, Riches, and Value of this Part of the World; and the immense Profits the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> drew from a small Settlement or two thereon made; resolv'd upon an Adventure for further Discoveries.</p>
                     <p>According to this Purpose, in the Year of our Lord, 1583, He got several Men of great Value and Estate to join with him in an Expedition of this Nature: And for their Incouragement obtain'd Letters Patents from Queen <hi rend="italics">Elizabeth,</hi> bearing date the 25th of <hi rend="italics">March,</hi> 1584, for turning their Discoveries to their own Advantage.</p>

                     <p>§. 2. In <hi rend="italics">April</hi> following they set out Two small Vessels under the Command of Capt. <hi rend="italics">Philip Amidas,</hi> and Capt. <hi rend="italics">Arthur Barlow;</hi> who, after a prosperous Voyage, anchor'd at the Inlet by <hi rend="italics">Roenoke,</hi> at present under the Government of North <hi rend="italics">Carolina.</hi> They made good Profit of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Truck, which they bought for Things of much inferior Value, and return'd. Being over-pleased with their Profits, and finding all Things there entirely new, and surprizing; they gave a very advantageous Account of Matters; by representing the Country so delightful, and desirable; so pleasant, and plentiful; the Climate, and Air, so temperate, sweet, and wholsome; the Woods, and Soil, so charming, and fruitful; and all other Things so agreeable, that Paradice it self seem'd to be there, in its first Native Lustre.</p>
                     <p>They gave particular Accounts of the Variety of good Fruits, and some whereof they had never seen the Like before; but above all, that there were Grapes in such abundance, as was never known in the World: Stately tall large Oaks, and other
<pb n="3"/>
Timber; Red Cedar, Cypress, Pines, and other Evergreens, and Sweetwoods; for tallness and largeness exceeding all they had ever heard of: Wild Fowl, Fish, Deer, and other Game in such Plenty, and Variety; that no Epicure could desire more than this New World did seem naturally to afford.</p>
                     <p>And, to make it yet more desirable, they reported the Native <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> (which were then the only Inhabitants) so affable, kind, and good-natur'd; so uncultivated in Learning, Trades, and Fashions; so innocent, and ignorant of all manner of Politicks, Tricks, and Cunning; and so desirous of the Company of the <hi rend="italics">English:</hi> That they seem'd rather to be like soft Wax, ready to take any Impression, than any ways likely to oppose the Settling of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> near them: They represented it as a Scene laid open for the good and gracious Q. <hi rend="italics">Elizabeth,</hi> to propagate the Gospel in, and extend her Dominions over: As if purposely reserv'd for her Majesty, by a peculiar Direction of Providence, that had brought all former Adventures in this Affair to nothing: And to give a further Taste of their Discovery, they took with them, in their Return for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> Two Men of the Native <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> named <hi rend="italics">Wanchese</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Manteo.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>§. 3. Her Majesty accordingly took the Hint, and espoused the Project, as far as her present Engagements in War with <hi rend="italics">Spain</hi> would let her; being so well pleased with the Account given, that as the greatest Mark of Honour she could do the Discovery, she call'd the Country by the Name of <hi rend="italics">Virginia;</hi> as well, for that it was first discover'd in her Reign, a Virgin Queen; as that it did still seem to retain the Virgin Purity and Plenty of the first Creation, and the People their Primitive Innocence: For they seem'd not debauch'd nor corrupted with
<pb n="4"/>
those Pomps and Vanities, which had depraved and inslaved the Rest of Mankind; neither were their Hands harden'd by Labour, nor their Minds corrupted by the Desire of hoarding up Treasure: They were without Boundaries to their Land; and without Property in Cattle; and seem'd to have escaped, or rather not to have been concern'd in the first Curse, <hi rend="italics">Of getting their Bread by the Sweat of their Brows:</hi> For, by their Pleasure alone, they supplied all their Necessities; namely, by Fishing, Fowling and Hunting; Skins being their only Cloathing; and these too, Five Sixths of the Year thrown by: Living without Labour, and only gathering the Fruits of the Earth when ripe, or fit for use: Neither fearing present Want, nor solicitous for the Future, but daily finding sufficient afresh for their Subsistance.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 4. This Report was back'd, nay much advanc'd, by the vast Riches and Treasure mention'd in several Merchants Letters from <hi rend="italics">Mexico</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Peru,</hi> to their Correspondents in <hi rend="italics">Spain;</hi> which Letters were taken with their Ships and Treasure, by some of ours in her Majesty's Service, in Prosecution of the <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi> Wars: This was Incouragement enough for a new Adventure, and set Peoples Invention at work, till they had satisfied themselves, and made sufficient Essays for the further Discovery of the Country. Pursuant whereunto Sir <hi rend="italics">Richard Greenvile,</hi> the Chief of Sir <hi rend="italics">Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Associates, having obtain'd Seven Sail of Ships, well laden with Provision, Arms, Ammunition, and spare Men to make a Settlement, set out in Person with them early in the Spring of the succeeding Year, to make further Discoveries, taking back the Two <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> with him; and according to his Wish, in the latter End of <hi rend="italics">May,</hi> arriv'd at the same Place, where the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> had been the Year before; there he made a
<pb n="5"/>
Settlement, sow'd Beans and Peas, which he saw come up and grow to Admiration while he staid, which was about Two Months; and having made some little Discoveries more in the <hi rend="italics">Sound</hi> to the Southward, and got some Treasure in Skins, Furs, Pearl, and other Rarities of the Country, for Things of inconsiderable Value, he return'd for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> leaving One Hundred and Eight Men upon <hi rend="italics">Roenoke</hi> Island, under the Command of Mr. <hi rend="italics">Ralph Lane,</hi> to keep Possession.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 5. As soon as Sir <hi rend="italics">Richard Greenvile</hi> was gone, they, according to Order and their own Inclination, set themselves earnestly about discovering the Country, and ranged about a little too indiscreetly up the Rivers, and into the Land backward from the Rivers, which gave the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> a Jealousie of their Meaning: For they cut off several Straglers of them, and had laid Designs to destroy the rest, but were happily prevented. This put the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> upon the Precaution of keeping more within Bounds, and not venturing themselves too defenceless Abroad, who till then had depended too much upon the Natives Simplicity and Innocence.</p>
                     <p>After the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had done this Mischief, they never observ'd any real Faith towards those <hi rend="italics">English:</hi> For being naturally suspicious and revengeful themselves, they never thought the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> could forgive them; and so by this Jealousie, caus'd by the Cowardize of their Nature, they were continually doing Mischief.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> notwithstanding all this, continued their Discoveries, but more carefully than they had done before, and kept the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> in some Awe, by threatning them with the Return of their Companions again with a greater Supply of Men and Goods: And, before the Cold of the Winter became
<pb n="6"/>
uneasie, they had extended their Discoveries near an Hundred Miles along the Sea-Coast to the Northward; but not reaching the Southern Cape of <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak</hi> Bay in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> they had as yet found no good Harbour.</p>

In this Condition they maintain'd their Settlement all the Winter, and till <hi rend="italics">August</hi> following; but were much distress'd for Want of Provisions, not having learn'd to gather Food, as the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> did, nor having Conveniencies like them of taking Fish and Fowl: Besides, being now fallen out with the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> they fear'd to expose themselves to their Contempt and Cruelty; because they had not received the Supply they talk'd of, and which had been expected in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>All they could do under these Distresses, and the Despair of the Recruits promised them this Year, was only to keep a good looking out to Seaward, if, perchance, they might find any Means of Escape, or Recruit. And, to their great Joy and Satisfaction, in <hi rend="italics">August</hi> aforesaid, they happen'd to espy, and make themselves be seen to Sir <hi rend="italics">Francis Drake</hi>'s Fleet, consisting of Twenty Three Sail, who being sent by her Majesty upon the Coast of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> in Search of the <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi> Treasures, had Orders from her Majesty to take a View of this Plantation, and see what Assistance or Encouragement it wanted: Their first Petition to him was to grant them a fresh Supply of Men and Provisions, with a small Vessel, and Boats to attend them; that so if they should be put to Distress for want of Relief, they might imbark for <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> This was as readily granted by Sir <hi rend="italics">Francis Drake</hi> as ask'd by them; and a Ship was appointed them, which Ship they began immediately to fit up, and supply plentifully with all manner of Stores for a long Stay; but while they were a doing this, a great Storm
<pb n="7"/>
arose, and drove that very Ship (with some others) from her Anchor to Sea, and so she was lost for that Occasion.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi rend="italics">Francis</hi> would have given them another Ship, but this Accident coming on the Back of so many Hardships which they had undergone, daunted them, and put them upon imagining that Providence was averse to their Designs: And now having given over, for that Year, the Expectation of their promised Supply from <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> they consulted together, and agreed to desire Sir <hi rend="italics">Francis Drake</hi> to take them along with him, which he did.</p>
                     <p>Thus their first Intention of Settlement fell, after discovering many Things of the natural Growth of the Country, useful for the Life of Man, and beneficial to Trade, they having observ'd a vast Variety of Fish, Fowl and Beasts; Fruits, Seeds, Plants, Roots, Timber-Trees, Sweet-Woods and Gums: They had likewise attain'd some little Knowledge in the Language of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> their Religion, Manners, and Ways of Correspondence one with another; and been made sensible of their Cunning and Treachery towards themselves.</p>

While these Things were thus acting in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> the Adventures in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> were providing, tho' too tediously, to send them Recruits. And tho' it was late before they could dispatch them (for they met with several Disappointments, and had many Squabbles among themselves.) However, at last they provided Four good Ships, with all manner of Recruits suitable for the Colony, and Sir <hi rend="italics">Walter Raleigh</hi> designed to go in Person with them.</p>
                     <pb n="8"/>
                     <p>Sir <hi rend="italics">Walter</hi> got his Ship ready first, and fearing the ill Consequence of a Delay, and the Discouragement it might be to those that were left to make a Settlement, he set Sail by himself. And a Fortnight after him Sir <hi rend="italics">Richard Greenvile</hi> sail'd with the Three other Ships.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi rend="italics">Walter</hi> fell in with the Land at Cape <hi rend="italics">Hattoras,</hi> a little to the Southward of the Place, where the 108 Men had been settled, and after Search not finding them, he return'd: However, Sir <hi rend="italics">Richard,</hi> with his Ships, found the Place where he had left the Men, but entirely deserted, which was at first a great Disheartening to him, thinking them all destroy'd, because he knew not that Sir <hi rend="italics">Francis Drake</hi> had been there, and taken them off; but he was a little better satisfied by <hi rend="italics">Manteo</hi>'s Report, that they were not cut off by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> tho' he could give no good Account what was become of them. However, notwithstanding this seeming Discouragement, he again left Fifty Men in the same Island of <hi rend="italics">Roenoke,</hi> built them Houses necessary, gave them Two Years Provision, and return'd.</p>

Three Ships more were sent, under the Command of Mr. <hi rend="italics">John White,</hi> who himself was to settle there as Governour with more Men, and some Women, carrying also plentiful Recruits of Provisions.</p>
                     <p>In the latter End of <hi rend="italics">July</hi> they arrived at <hi rend="italics">Roenoke</hi> aforesaid, where they again encounter'd the uncomfortable News of the Loss of these Men also; who (as they were inform'd by <hi rend="italics">Manteo</hi>) were secretly set upon by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> some cut off, and the others fled, and not to be heard of, and their Place of Habitation now all grown up with Weeds. However, they repair'd the Houses on <hi rend="italics">Roenoke,</hi> and sate down there again.</p>

                     <p>The 13th of <hi rend="italics">August</hi> they christen'd <hi rend="italics">Manteo,</hi> and stiled him Lord of <hi rend="italics">Dassamonpeak,</hi> an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Nation so call'd, in Reward of the Fidelity he had shown to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> from the Beginning; who being the first <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that was made a Christian in that Part of the World, I thought it not amiss to remember him.</p>
                     <p>On the same Occasion also may be mention'd the first Child there born of Christian Parentage, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> a Daughter of Mr. <hi rend="italics">Ananias Dare.</hi> She was born the 18th of the same <hi rend="italics">August</hi> upon <hi rend="italics">Roenoke,</hi> and, after the Name of the Country, was christen'd <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This seem'd to be a Settlement prosperously made, being carry'd on with much Zeal and Unanimity among themselves. The Form of Government consisted of a Governour and Twelve Councellors, incorporated by the Name of the Governour and Assistants of the City of <hi rend="italics">Raleigh</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi>

                     <p>Many Nations of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> renew'd their Peace, and made firm Leagues with the Corporation: The chief Men of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> also were so far from being dishearten'd at the former Disappointments, that they disputed for the Liberty of remaining on the Spot; and by meer Constraint compell'd Mr. <hi rend="italics">White,</hi> their Governour, to return for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> to negociate the Business of their Recruits and Supply, as a Man the most capable to manage that Affair, leaving at his Departure One Hundred and Fifteen in the Corporation.</p>

It was above Two Years before Mr. <hi rend="italics">White</hi> could obtain any Grant of Supplies; and then, in the latter End of the Year 1589. he set out from <hi rend="italics">Plimouth</hi> with Three Ships, and sail'd round by the <hi rend="italics">Western</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Carribbee</hi> Islands, they having hither to not found any nearer Way: For tho' they
<pb n="10"/>
were skill'd in Navigation, and understood the Use of the Globes, yet did Example so much prevail upon them, that they chose to sail a Thousand Leagues about, rather than attempt a more direct Passage.</p>
                     <p>Towards the Middle of <hi rend="italics">August,</hi> 1590. they arriv'd upon the Coast, at Cape <hi rend="italics">Hattoras,</hi> and went to search upon <hi rend="italics">Roenoke</hi> for the People; but found, by Letters on the Trees, that they were remov'd to <hi rend="italics">Croatan,</hi> one of the Islands forming the <hi rend="italics">Sound,</hi> and Southward of <hi rend="italics">Roenoke</hi> about Twenty Leagues, but no Sign of Distress. Thither they design'd to sail to them in their Ships; but a Storm arising in the mean while, lay so hard upon them, that their Cables broke; they lost Three of their Anchors, were forced to Sea; and so return'd Home, without ever going near those poor People again for Sixteen Years following: And it is supposed, that the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> seeing them forsaken by their Country, and unfurnish'd of their expected Supplies, cut them off: For to this Day they were never more heard of.</p>
                     <p>Thus, after all this vast Expence and Trouble, and the Hazard and Loss of so many Lives, Sir <hi rend="italics">Walter Raleigh,</hi> the great Projector and Furtherer of these Discoveries and Settlements, being under Trouble, all Thoughts of further prosecuting these Designs, lay dead for about Twelve Years following.</p>

And then, in the Year 1602 Capt. <hi rend="italics">Gosnell</hi> who had made one in the former Adventures, furnish'd out a small Bark from <hi rend="italics">Dartmouth,</hi> and set Sail in her himself, with Thirty odd Men; designing a more direct Course, and not to stand so far to the Southward, nor pass by the <hi rend="italics">Carribbee</hi> Islands, as all former Adventurers had done. He attain'd his Ends in that; but touch'd upon the Coast of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> much to the Northward of any
<pb n="11"/>
of the Places where the former Adventurers had landed: For he fell first among the Islands, forming the Northern Side of <hi rend="italics">Massachusett</hi>'s Bay in <hi rend="italics">New-England;</hi> but not finding the Conveniencies that Harbour affords, set Sail again Southward, and, as he thought, clear of Land into the Sea; but fell upon the Byte of Cape <hi rend="italics">Codd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this Coast, and a little to the Southward, he spent some time in Trade with the <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> and gave Names to the Islands of <hi rend="italics">Martha</hi>'s <hi rend="italics">Vineyard,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi rend="italics">Isle,</hi> which retain the same to this Day. Upon <hi rend="italics">Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi rend="italics">Isle</hi> he made an Experiment of <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Grain, and found it spring up and grow to Admiration, as it had done at <hi rend="italics">Roenoke:</hi> Here also his Men built Huts to shelter them in the Nights, and bad Weather; and made good Profit by their <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Traffick of Furs, Skins, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> And, as their Pleasure invited them, would visit the Main; set Receivers, and save the Gums, and Juices distilling from Sweet-Woods; and try and examine the lesser Vegetables.</p>
                     <p>After a Month's Stay here, they return'd for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> as well pleased with the natural Beauty and Richness of the Place they had view'd, as they were with the Treasure they had gather'd in it: Neither had they a Head, nor a Finger that ach'd among them all the time.</p>

The Noise of this short, and most profitable of all the former Voyages, set the <hi rend="italics">Bristol</hi> Merchants to Work also; who early in the Year 1603. sent Two Vessels in Search of the same Place and Trade; which Vessels fell luckily in with the same Land.

                     <p>§. 12. In the Year 1605, a Voyage was made from <hi rend="italics">London</hi> in a single Ship, with which they design'd to fall in with the Land about the Latitude 39°; but the Winds put her a little further Northward, and the fell upon the Eastern Parts of <hi rend="italics">Long-Island</hi> (as it is now call'd, but all went then under the Name of <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi>) Here they traffick'd with the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as the others had done before them; made short Trials of the Soil by <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Grain, and found the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as in all other Places, very fair and courteous at first, till they got more Knowledge of the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and perhaps thought themselves over-reach'd, because one bought better Pennyworths than another; upon which afterwards they never fail'd to take Revenge as they found their Opportunity or Advantage. So this Company also return'd with the Ship, having ranged Forty Miles up <hi rend="italics">Connecticut</hi> River, and call'd the Harbour where they rid <hi rend="italics">Penticost</hi> Harbour because of their Arrival there on <hi rend="italics">Whitsunday.</hi>

So strong was the Desire of Riches, and so eager the Pursuit of a rich Trade, that all Concern for the Lives of their fellow Christians, Kindred, Neighbours and Country-men, weigh'd nothing in the Comparison; tho' an Enquiry might have been easily made, when they were so near them.</p>

THE Merchants of <hi rend="italics">London, Bristol, Exeter</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Plimouth,</hi> soon perceived what great Gains might be made of a Trade this Way, if it were well managed, and Colonies could be rightly settled; which was sufficiently evinced by the great Profits some Ships had made, which had not met with ill Accidents. Encouraged by this Prospect, they join'd together in a Petition to King <hi rend="italics">James</hi> the First; shewing forth, That it would be too much for any single Person to attempt the Settling of Colonies, and to carry on so considerable a Trade: They therefore pray'd his Majesty to incorporate them, and enable them to raise a joint Stock for that Purpose, and to countenance their Undertaking.</p>
                     <p>His Majesty did accordingly grant their Petition, and by Letters Patents bearing Date the 10th of <hi rend="italics">April, 1606,</hi> did in one Patent incorporate them into Two distinct Companies to make Two separate Colonies, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> “Sir <hi rend="italics">Tho.

And now all Things seem'd to promise a Plantation in good Earnest. Providence seem'd likewise very favourable to them: For tho' they designed only for that Part of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi>

where the Hundred and Fifteen were left, and where there is no Security of Harbour: Yet, after a tedious Voyage of passing the old Way again, between the <hi rend="italics">Carribbee</hi> Islands and the Main, he, with Two of his Vessels, luckily fell in with <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> it self, that Part of the Continent now so call'd, anchoring in the Mouth of the Bay of <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak.</hi> And the first Place they landed upon, was the Southern Cape of that Bay, which they named Cape <hi rend="italics">Henry,</hi> and the Northern Cape <hi rend="italics">Charles,</hi> in Honour of the King's Two eldest Sons; and the first great River they search'd, whose <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Name was <hi rend="italics">Powhatan,</hi> they call'd <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, after the King's own Name.</p>

                     <p>§. 15. Before they would make any Settlement here, they made a full Search of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River; and then by an unanimous Consent pitched upon a <hi rend="italics">Peninsula</hi> about Fifty Miles up the River; which, besides the Goodness of the Soil, was esteem'd as most fit, and capable to be made a Place both of Trade and Security, Two Thirds thereof being environ'd by the main River, which affords good. Anchorage all along; and the other Third by a small narrow River, capable of receiving many Vessels of an Hundred Tun, quite up as high as till it meets within Thirty Yards of the main River again, and where generally in Spring-Tides it overflows into the main River: By which Means the Land they chose to pitch their Town upon, has obtain'd the Name of an Island. In this back River Ships and small Vessels may ride lashed to one another, and moor'd a Shore secure from all Wind and Weather whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>The Town, as well as the River, had the Honour to be called by King <hi rend="italics">James</hi>'s Name. The whole Island thus enclosed contains about Two Thousand Acres of high Land, and several Thousands
<pb n="16"/>
of very good and firm Marsh, and is an extraordinary good Pasture as any in that Country.</p>
                     <p>By Means of the narrow Passage, this Place was of great Security to them from the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Enemy: And if they had then known of the Biting of the Worm in the Salts, they would have valued this Place upon that Account also, as being free from that Mischief.</p>

                     <p>After Five Weeks Stay before this Town, the Ships return'd Home again, leaving One Hundred and Eight Men settled in the Form of Government before spoken of.</p>
                     <p>After the Ships were gone, the same sort of Feuds and Disorders happen'd continually among them, to the unspeakable Damage of the Plantation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> were the same there as in all other Places; at first very fair and friendly, tho afterwards they gave great Proofs of their Deceitfulness. However, by the Help of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Provisions, the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> chiefly subsisted till the Return of the Ships the next Year; when Two Vessels were sent thither full freighted with Men and Provisions for Supply of the Plantation, one of which only arriv'd directly, and the other being beat off to the <hi rend="italics">Carribbee</hi> Islands, did not arrive till the former was sail'd hence again.</p>

<pb n="17"/>
the greater Satisfaction of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and the greater Ease and Security of themselves; if they had been under any Rule, or subject to any Method in Trade, and not left at Liberty to outvie or outbid one another; by which they not only cut short their own Profit, but created Jealousies and Disturbances among the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> by letting one have a better Bargain than another: For they being unaccustom'd to barter, such of them as had been hardest dealt by in their Commodities, thought themselves cheated and abused; and so conceiv'd a Grudge against the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> in general, making it a National Quarrel: And this seems to be the original Cause of most of their subsequent Misfortunes by the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What also gave a greater Interruption to this Trade, was an Object that drew all their Eyes and Thoughts aside, even from taking the necessary Care for their Preservation, and for the Support of their Lives; which was this; They found in a Neck of Land, on the Back of <hi rend="italics">James-Town-Island,</hi> a fresh Stream of Water springing out of a small Bank, which wash'd down with it a yellow sort of Dust-Isinglass, which being cleansed by the fresh streaming of the Water, lay shining in the Bottom of that limpid Element, and stirr'd up in them an unseasonable and inordinate Desire after Riches: For they, taking all to be Gold that glister'd, run into the utmost Distraction, neglecting both the necessary Defence of their Lives from the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and the Support of their Bodies by securing of Provisions; absolutely relying, like <hi rend="italics">Midas,</hi> upon the Almighty Power of Gold, thinking, that where this was in plenty nothing could be wanting: But they soon grew sensible of their Error; and found that if this gilded Dirt bad been real Gold, it could have been of no Advantage to them.

Scarcity of Provisions, and that little they had, was lost by the Burning of their Town, while all Hands were employ'd upon this imaginary Golden Treasure; so that they were forced to live for sometime upon the wild Fruits of the Earth, and upon Crabs, Muscles, and such like, not having a Day's Provision before-hand; as some of the laziest <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who have no Pleasure in Exercise, and won't be at the Pains to fish and hunt: And, indeed, not so well as they neither; For by this careless neglecting of their Defence against the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> many of 'em were destroy'd by that cruel People; and the Rest durst not venture abroad, but were forced to be content with what fell just into their Mouths.</p>

In this Condition they were, when the first Ship of the Two before-mention'd came to their Assistance, but their Golden Dreams overcame all Difficulties: They spoke not, nor thought of any thing but Gold, and that was all the Lading that most of them were willing to take Care for; accordingly they put into this Ship all the yellow Dirt they had gathered, and what Skins and Furs they had trucked for; and filling her up with Cedar, sent her away.</p>
                     <p>After she was gone, the other Ship arrived, which they stow'd likewise with this supposed Gold-Dust, designing never to be poor again; filling her up with Cedar and Clap-board.</p>
                     <p>Those Two Ships being thus dispatched, they made several Discoveries in <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, and up <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak</hi> Bay, by the Undertaking and Management of Capt. <hi rend="italics">John Smith:</hi> And the Year 1608 was the first Year in which they gather'd <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn of their own planting.</p>

Thus the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> continued to give themselves as much Perplexity by their own Distraction, as the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> did by their Watchfulness and Resentments.</p>

IN the mean while the Treasurer, Council, and Company of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> Adventurers in <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> not finding that Return and Profit from the Adventures they expected; and rightly judging that this Disappointment, as well as the idle Quarrels in the Colony, proceeded from a Mismanage of the Government; petition'd his Majesty, and got a new Patent with Leave to appoint a Governour.</p>
                     <p>Upon this new Grant they sent out Nine Ships, and plentiful Supplies of Men and Provisions; and made Three Joint Commissioners or Governours in equal Power, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> Sir <hi rend="italics">Thomas Gates,</hi> Sir <hi rend="italics">George Summers,</hi> and Capt. <hi rend="italics">Newport.</hi> They agreed to go all together in one Ship.</p>
                     <p>This Ship, on Board of which the Three Governours had embarqued, being separated from the Rest, was put to great Distress in a severe Storm; and after Three Days and Nights constant Baling and Pumping, was at last cast Ashore at <hi rend="italics">Bermudas,</hi> and there staved, but by good Providence the Company was preserved.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this Shipwreck, and Extremity they were put to, yet could not this common Misfortune make them agree. The Best of it was, they found Plenty of Provisions in that Island, and no <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> to annoy them: But still they quarrell'd
<pb n="21"/>
amongst themselves, and none more than the Two Knights; who made their Parties, built each of them a Cedar Vessel, one call'd the <hi rend="italics">Patience,</hi> the other the <hi rend="italics">Deliverance,</hi> and used what they gather'd of the Furniture of the old Ship for Rigging, and Fish-Oil, and Hogs-Grease mix'd with Lime and Ashes instead of Pitch and Tar: For they found great Plenty of <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi> Hogs in this Island, which are supposed to have swam ashore from some Wrecks, and there afterwards increased.</p>

                     <p>§. 21. While these Things were acting in <hi rend="italics">Bermudas,</hi> Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> being very much burnt by the accidental Firing of some Gun-Powder, as he was upon a Discovery in his Boat, was forced for his Cure sake, and the Benefit of a Surgeon, to take his Passage for <hi rend="italics">England</hi> in a Ship that was then upon the Point of Sailing.</p>
                     <p>Several of the Nine Ships that came out with the Three Governours arrived, with many of the Passengers; some of which in their Humours wou'd not submit to the Government there, pretending the New Commission destroy'd the Old one; that Governours were appointed instead of a President, and that they themselves were to be of the Council; and so wou'd assume an independent Power, inspiring the People with Disobedience; by which Means they became frequently exposed in great Parties to the Cruelty of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>; all sorts of Discipline was laid aside, and their necessary Defence neglected; so that the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> taking Advantage of those Divisions, form'd a Stratagem to destroy them Root and Branch, and indeed they did cut many of 'em off, by massacring whole Companies at a time; so that all the Out-Settlements were deserted, and the People that were not destroy'd took Refuge in <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> except the
<pb n="22"/>
small Settlement at <hi rend="italics">Kiquotan,</hi> where they had built themselves a little Fort, and call'd it <hi rend="italics">Algernoon</hi> Fort: And yet, for all this, they continued their Disorders, wasting their old Provisions, and neglecting to gather others; so that they who remain'd alive were all near famish'd, having brought themselves to that Pass, that they durst not stir from their own Doors to gather the Fruits of the Earth, or the Crabs and Mussels from the Water-side: Much less to hunt or catch wild Beasts, Fish or Fowl, which were found in great Abundance there. They continued in these scanty Circumstances till they were at last reduced to such Extremity, as to eat the very Hides of their Horses, and the Bodies of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> they had killed; and sometimes also upon a Pinch they wou'd not disdain to dig them up again to make a homely Meal of after they had been buried. And that Time is to this Day remember'd by the Name of the <hi rend="italics">Starving Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus a few Months indiscreet Management brought such an Infamy upon the Country, that to this Day it cannot be wiped away: And the Sicknesses occasion'd by this bad Diet, or rather want of Diet are unjustly remember'd to the Disadvantage of the Country, as a Fault in the Climate; which was only the Foolishness and Indiscretion of those who assumed the Power of Governing. I call it assumed because the New Commission mention'd, by which they pretended to be of the Council, was not in all this time arrived, but remain'd in <hi rend="italics">Bermudas</hi> with the new Governours.</p>
                     <p>Here I can't but admire the Care, Labour, Courage and Understanding that Capt. <hi rend="italics">John Smith</hi> show'd in the Time of his Administration; who not only founded, but also preserved all these Settlements in good Order, while he was amongst them. And without him, they had certainly all been destroy'd,
<pb n="23"/>
either by Famine, or the Enemy long before; tho' the Country naturally afforded Subsistance enough, even without any other Labour than that of Gathering and Preserving its Spontaneous Provisions.</p>
                     <p>For the first Three Years that Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> was with them, they never had in that whole Time above Six Months <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Provisions. But as soon as he had left 'em to themselves, all went to Ruine; for the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had no longer any Fear for themselves, or Friendship for the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi> And Six Months after this Gentleman's Departure, the 500 Men that he left were reduced to Threescore; and they too must of Necessity have starved, if their Relief had been with-held a Week longer.</p>

Sir <hi rend="italics">Thomas Gates,</hi> Sir <hi rend="italics">George Summers,</hi> and Capt. <hi rend="italics">Newport,</hi> the Governours, were very compassionate of their Condition; and call'd a Council, wherein they inform'd them, that they had but Sixteen Days Provision Aboard; and therefore desired to know their Opinion, whether they would venture to Sea under such a Scarcity: Or if they resolved to continue in the Settlement, and take their Fortunes; they would stay likewise, and share the Provisions among them; but desired that their Determination might be speedy. They soon came
<pb n="24"/>
to the Conclusion of returning for <hi rend="italics">England:</hi> But because their Provisions were short, they resolved to go by the Banks of <hi rend="italics">Newfoundland,</hi> in Hopes of meeting with some of the Fishermen, (this being now the Season) and dividing themselves among their Ships for the greater Certainty of Provision, and for their better Accommodation.</p>
                     <p>According to this Resolution, they all went aboard, and fell down to <hi rend="italics">Hog-Island</hi> the 9th of <hi rend="italics">June</hi> at Night, and the next Morning to <hi rend="italics">Mulberry-Island</hi> Point, which is Eighteen Miles below <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> and Thirty above the Mouth of the River; and there they spied a Long-Boat, which the Lord <hi rend="italics">Delawar</hi> (who was just arrived with Three Ships) had sent before him up the River sounding the Channel. His Lordship was made sole Governour, and was accompanied by several Gentlemen of Condition. He caused all the Men to return again to <hi rend="italics">James-Town;</hi> resettled them with Satisfaction, and staid with them till <hi rend="italics">March</hi> following; and then being very sick, he return'd for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> leaving about Two Hundred in the Colony.</p>

This Account was presented to her Majesty, and graciously received: But before Captain <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> sail'd for <hi rend="italics">New-England,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Princess arrived at <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> and her Husband took Lodgings for her at <hi rend="italics">Branford,</hi> to be a little out of the Smoak of the City, whither Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith,</hi> with some of her Friends, went to see her, and congratulate her Arrival, letting her know the Address he had made to the Queen in her Favour.</p>
                     <p>Till this Lady arrived in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> she had all along been inform'd that Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> was dead, because he had been diverted from that Colony by making Settlements in the Second Plantation, now call'd <hi rend="italics">New-England:</hi> For which Reason, when she see him, she seem'd to think herself much affronted, for that they had dared to impose so gross an Untruth upon her, and at first Sight of him turn'd away. It cost him a great deal of Intreaty, and some Hours Attendance, before she would do him the Honour to speak to him: But at last she was reconcil'd, and talk'd freely to him. She put him in mind of her former Kindnesses, and then upbraided him for his Forgetfulness of her, shewing by her Reproaches, that even a State of Nature teaches to abhor Ingratitude.</p>
                     <pb n="32"/>
                     <p>She had in her Retinue a Great Man of her own Nation, whose Name was <hi rend="italics">Uttamaccomack:</hi> This Man had Orders from <hi rend="italics">Powhatan,</hi> to count the People in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and give him an Account of their Number. Now the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> having no Letters among them, he at his going ashore provided a Stick, in which he was to make a Notch for every Man he see; but this Accomptant soon grew weary of that tedious Exercise, and threw his Stick away: And at his return, being asked by his King, <hi rend="italics">How many People there were; He desired him to count the Stars in the Sky, the Leaves upon the Trees, and the Sand on the Sea-shore, for so many People</hi> (he said) <hi rend="italics">were in</hi> England.</p>

Upon all which Occasions she behaved her self with so much Decency, and show'd so much Grandure in her Deportment, that she made good the brightest Part of the Character Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> had given of her. In the mean while she gain'd the good Opinion of every Body, so much that the poor Gentleman her Husband had like to have been call'd to an Account for presuming to marry a Princess Royal without the King's Consent; because it had been suggested that he had taken Advantage of her being a Prisoner, and forc'd her to marry him. But upon a more perfect Representation of the Matter, his Majesty was pleased at last to declare himself satisfied.</p>

In this Condition they were when Capt. <hi rend="italics">Samuel Argall</hi> was sent thither Governour, <hi rend="italics">Anno</hi> 1617. who found the Number of People reduc'd to something more than Four Hundred, of which not above Half were fit for Labour.

This <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough</hi> was a cunning and a brave Prince, who soon grasp'd all the Empire to himself: But at first they jointly renew'd the Peace with the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> upon the Accession of <hi rend="italics">Itopatin</hi> to the Crown.</p>

Governour <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> flourishing thus under the Blessings of Peace and Plenty, and having no Occasion of Fear or Disturbance from the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> sought new Occasions of incouraging the Plantation. To that End he intended a Coasting Voyage to the Northward, to view the Places where the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Ships had so often laded; and if he miss'd them, to reach the Fisheries on the Banks of <hi rend="italics">Newfoundland,</hi> and so settle a Trade and Correspondence either with the One or the Other. In Accomplishing whereof, as he touch'd at Cape <hi rend="italics">Codd,</hi> he was inform'd by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> That some White People like him were come to inhabit to the Northward of them, upon the Coast of their Neighbouring Nations. Capt. <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> not having heard of any <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Plantation that Way, was jealous that it might be (as it proved) the People of some other Nation. And being very zealous for the Honour and Benefit of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> he resolved to make Search according to the Information he had
<pb n="35"/>
receiv'd, and see who they were. Accordingly he found the , and a Ship riding before it. This belong'd to some <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Men, who had fortified themselves upon a small Mount on the North of <hi rend="italics">New-England.</hi>

His unexpected Arrival so confounded the <hi rend="italics">French,</hi> that they cou'd make no Preparation for Resistance on Board their Ship; which Captain <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> drew so close to, that with his small Arms he beat all the Men from the Deck, so that they cou'd not use their Guns, their Ship having only a single Deck. Among others, there were Two Jesuits on Board, one of which being more bold than wise, with all that Disadvantage, endeavour'd to fire one of their Cannon, and was shot dead for his Pains.</p>
                     <p>Capt. <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> having taken the Ship, landed and went before the Fort, summoning it to surrender. The Garrison ask'd Time to advise: But that being denied them, they stole privately away, and fled into the Woods. Upon this Capt. <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> enter'd the Fort, and lodged there that Night; and the next Day the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> came to him, and surrender'd themselves. It seems the King of <hi rend="italics">France</hi> had granted them a Patent for this Settlement, but they gave it up to Capt. <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> to be cancell'd. He used them very well, and suffer'd such as had a Mind to return to <hi rend="italics">France,</hi> to seek their Passage among the Ships of the Fishery: But obliged them to desert this Settlement.

With the same Ease he took that Settlement also; where the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> had sow'd and reap'd, built Barns, Mills, and other Conveniencies, which Capt. <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> did no Damage to: But unsettled them, and obliged them to make a Desertion from thence. He gave these the same Leave he had done the Others to dispose of themselves; some whereof return'd to <hi rend="italics">France,</hi> and others went to settleup the River of <hi rend="italics">Canada.</hi> After this Governour <hi rend="italics">Argall</hi> return'd satisfied with the Provision and Plunder he had got in those Two Settlements.</p>

                     <p>This was the First General Assembly that ever was held there. I heartily wish, tho' they did not unite their Houses again, they wou'd however unite their Endeavours and Affections for the Good of the Country.</p>

The People now knew their own Property, and having the Encouragement of Working for their own Advantage, many became very industrious, and began to vie one with another, in Planting, Building, and other Improvements. Two

Gentlemen went over as Deputies to the Company, for the Management of their Lands, and those of the College. All Thoughts of Danger from the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> were laid aside. Several great Gifts were made to the Church and College, and for the Bringing up Young <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> at School. Forms were made, and Rules appointed for granting Patents for Land, upon the Condition of importing Goods and Persons to supply and increase the Colony.

A Salt-Work was set up at Cape <hi rend="italics">Charles,</hi> on the Eastern Shore; and an Iron-Work at <hi rend="italics">Falling-Creek,</hi> in <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, where they made Proof of good Iron Oar, and brought the whole Work so near Perfection, that they writ Word to the Company in <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> that they did not doubt but to finish the Work, and have plentiful Provision of Iron for them by the next <hi rend="italics">Easter.</hi> At that time the Fame of the Plenty and Riches in which the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> lived there, was very great: And Sir <hi rend="italics">George Yardly</hi> now had all the Appearance of making Amends for the Errors of his former Government. Nevertheless he let them run into the same Sleepyness and Security as before, neglecting all Thoughts of a necessary Defence, which laid the Foundation of the following Calamities.</p>

The People began to grow numerous, Thirteen Hundred settling there that Year; which was the Occasion of making so much Tobacco, as to overstock the Market,
<pb n="39"/>
Wherefore his Majesty, out of Pity to the Country, sent his Commands, That they should not suffer their Planters to make above One Hundred Pounds of Tobacco <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Man; for the Market was so low, that he cou'd not afford to give 'em above Three Shillings the Pound for it. He advised them rather to turn their spare Time towards providing Corn and Stock, and towards the Making of Potash, or other Manufactures.</p>
                     <p>It was, <hi rend="italics">October,</hi> 1621, that Sir <hi rend="italics">Francis Wyat</hi> arrived Governour, and in <hi rend="italics">November</hi> Capt. <hi rend="italics">Newport</hi> arrived with Fifty Men imported at his own Charge, besides Passengers; and made a Plantation on <hi rend="italics">Newport</hi>'s <hi rend="italics">News,</hi> naming it after himself. The Governour made a Review of all the Settlements, and suffer'd new Ones to be made even as far <hi rend="italics">Patowmeck</hi> River. This ought to be observed of the Eastern Shore <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that they never gave the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> any Trouble, but courted and befriended them from first to last. Perhaps the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> by the Time they came to settle those Parts, had consider'd how to rectifie their former Mismanagement, and learn'd better Methods of regulating their Trade with the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and of treating them more kindly than at first.</p>

                     <p>§. 45. <hi rend="italics">Anno,</hi> 1622, Inferior Courts were first appointed by the General Assembly, under the Name of <hi rend="italics">County Courts,</hi> for Tryal of Minute Causes; the Governour and Council still remaining Judges of the Supream Court of the Colony. In the mean time, by the great Increase of People, and the long Quiet they had enjoy'd among the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> since the Marriage of <hi rend="italics">Pocahontas,</hi> and the Accession of <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough</hi> to the Imperial Crown; all Men were lull'd into a fatal Security, and became every where familiar with the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> Eating, Drinking and Sleeping amongst them; by which Means they
<pb n="40"/>
became perfectly acquainted with all our <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Strength, and the Use of our Arms: Knowing at all Times, when and where to find our People; whether at Home, or in the Woods; in Bodies, or disperst; in Condition of Defence, or indefencible. This Exposing of their Weakness gave them Occasion to think more contemptibly of them, than otherwise, perhaps, they would have done; for which Reason they became more peevish, and more hardy to attempt any thing against them.</p>

                     <p>§. 46. Thus upon the Loss of one of their leading Men, (a War Captain, as they call him,) who was likewise supposed to be justly kill'd, <hi rend="italics">Oppechaucanough</hi> took Affront, and in Revenge laid the Plot of a general Massacre of the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> to be executed on the 22d of <hi rend="italics">March,</hi> 1622, a little before Noon, at a Time when our Men were all at Work abroad in their Plantations, disperst and unarm'd. This Hellish Contrivance was to take Effect upon all the several Settlements at one and the same Instant, except on the Eastern Shore, whither this Plot did not reach. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had been made so familiar with the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> as to borrow their Boats and Canoes to cross the Rivers in, when they went to consult with their Neighbouring <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> upon this execrable Conspiracy. And, to colour their Design the better, they brought Presents of Deer, Turkies, Fish and Fruits to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> the Evening before. The very Morning of the Massacre, they came freely and unarm'd among them, eating with them, and behaving themselves with the same Freedom and Friendship as formerly, till the very Minute they were to put their Plot in Execution. Then they fell to Work all at once every where, knocking the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> unawares on the Head, some with their Hatchets, which they call <hi rend="italics">Tommahauks,</hi> others with the Hows and Axes of
<pb n="41"/>
the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> themselves, shooting at those who escap'd the Reach of their Hands; sparing neither Age nor Sex, but destroying Man, Woman and Child, according to their cruel Way of leaving none behind to bear Resentment. But whatever was not done by Surprize that Day, was left undone, and many that made early Resistance escaped.</p>
                     <p>By the Account taken of the <hi rend="italics">Christians</hi> murder'd that Morning, they were found to be Three Hundred Forty Seven, most of them falling by their own Instruments, and Working-Tools.</p>

                     <p>Two <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that used to be employ'd by the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> to hunt for them, happen'd to lie together, the Night before the Massacre, in an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Man's House, where one of them was employ'd. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that was the Guest fell to perswading the other to rise and kill his Master, telling him, that he would do the same by his own the next Day. Whereupon he discover'd the whole Plot that was design'd to be executed on the Morrow. But the other, instead of entering into the Plot, and murdering his Master, got up (under Pretence of going to execute his Comrade's Advice) went into his Master's Chamber, and reveal'd to him the whole Story that he had been told. The Master hereupon arose, secur'd his own House, and before Day got to <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> which, together with such Plantations as cou'd receive Notice time enough, was saved by this Means; the rest, as they happen'd to be watchful in their Defence, also escaped: But such as were surpriz'd, were massacred. Captain <hi rend="italics">Croshaw</hi> in his Vessel at <hi rend="italics">Patowmeck,</hi> had Notice also given
<pb n="42"/>
him by a young <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> by which means he came off untouch'd.</p>

                     <p>§. 48. The Occasion upon which <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough</hi> took Affront was this. The War Captain mention'd before to have been kill'd, was called <hi rend="italics">Nemattanow.</hi> He was an active <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> a great Warriour, and in much Esteem among them; so much, that they believed him to be invulnerable, and immortal, because he had been in very many Conflicts, and escaped untouch'd from them all. He was also a very cunning Fellow, and took great Pride in preserving and increasing this their Superstition concerning him, affecting every thing that was odd and prodigious to work upon their Admiration. For which Purpose he wou'd often dress himself up with Feathers after a fantastick Manner, and by much Use of that Ornament, obtain'd among the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> the Nickname of <hi rend="italics">Jack of the Feather.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi rend="italics">Nemattanow</hi> coming to a private Settlement of one <hi rend="italics">Morgan,</hi> who had several Toys which he had a mind to, perswaded him to go to <hi rend="italics">Pamunky</hi> to dispose of them. He gave him Hopes what mighty Bargains he might meet with there, and kindly offer'd him his Assistance. At last <hi rend="italics">Morgan</hi> yielded to his Perswasion: But was no more heard of; and it is believ'd, that <hi rend="italics">Nemattanow</hi> kill'd him by the Way, and took away his Treasure. For within a few Days, this <hi rend="italics">Nemattanow</hi> return'd to the same House with <hi rend="italics">Morgan</hi>'s Cap upon his Head; where he found Two sturdy Boys, who ask'd for their Master. He very frankly told them, he was dead. But they, knowing the Cap again, suspected the Villain had kill'd their Master, and wou'd have had him before a Justice of Peace: But he refused to go, and very insolently abused them. Whereupon they shot him
<pb n="43"/>
down, and as they were carrying him to the Governour, he died.</p>
                     <p>As he was dying, he earnestly press'd the Boys to promise him Two Things; First, That they wou'd not tell how he was kill'd; and, Secondly, That they wou'd bury him among the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi> So great was the Pride of this vain Heathen, that he had no other Thoughts at his Death, but the Ambition of being esteem'd after he was dead, as he had endeavour'd to make them believe of him while he was alive, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> That he was Invulnerable and Immortal; tho' his increasing Faintness convinc'd himself of the Falsity of both. He imagined that being buried among the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> perhaps, might conceal his Death from his own Nation, who might think him translated to some happier Country. Thus he pleased himself to the last Gasp with the Boys Promises to carry on the Delusion. This was reckon'd all the Provocation given to that haughty and revengeful Man <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough,</hi> to act this bloody Tragedy, and to take indefatigable Pains to engage in so horrid Villany all the Kings and Nations bordering upon the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Settlements, on the Western Shore of <hi rend="italics">Chesepeak.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>§. 49. This gave the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> a fair Pretence of endeavouring the total Extirpation of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> but more-especially of <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough,</hi> and his Nation. Accordingly they set themselves about it, making use of the <hi rend="italics">Roman</hi> Maxim, (<hi rend="italics">Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks</hi>) to obtain their Ends. For, after some Months fruitless Pursuit of them, who cou'd too dexterously hide themselves in the Woods, the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> pretended Articles of Peace, giving them all manner of fair Words and Promises of Oblivion. They design'd thereby (as their own Letters now on Record, and their own Actions thereupon,
<pb n="44"/>
prove) to draw the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> back, and intice them to plant their Corn on their Habitations nearest adjoining to the <hi rend="italics">English;</hi> and then to cut it up when the Summer should be too far spent to leave them Hopes of another Crop that Year; by which Means they proposed to bring them to want Necessaries, and starve. And the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> did so far accomplish their Ends, as to bring the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> to plant their Corn at their usual Habitations, whereby they gain'd an Opportunity of repaying them some part of, the Debt in their own Coin; for they fell suddenly upon them, cut to Pieces such of them as could not make their Escape, and afterwards totally destroy'd their Corn.</p>

                     <p>§. 50. Another Effect of the Massacre of the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> was the Reducing all their Settlements again to Six or Seven in Number, for their better Defence. Besides, it was such a Disheartening to some good Projects, then just advancing, that to this Day they have never been put in Execution, namely, the Glass-Houses in <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> and the Iron-Work at <hi rend="italics">Falling-Creek,</hi> which has been already mention'd. The Massacre fell so hard upon this last Place, that no Soul was saved, but a Boy and a Girl, who, with great Difficulty, hid themselves.</p>
                     <p>The Superintendant of this Iron-Work had also discover'd a Vein of Lead Oar, which he kept private, and made use of it to furnish all the Neighbours with Bullets and Shot. But he being cut off with the rest, and the Secret not having been communicated, this Lead Mine could never after be found; till Colonel <hi rend="italics">Byrd,</hi> some few Years ago, prevail'd with an <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> under Pretence of Hunting, to give him a Sign, by dropping his <hi rend="italics">Tomahawk</hi> at the Place, (he not daring publickly to
<pb n="45"/>
discover it, for fear of being murder'd.) The Sign was accordingly given, and the Company at that Time found several Pieces of good Lead Oar upon the Surface of the Ground, and mark'd the Trees thereabouts: Not withstanding which, I know not by what Witchcraft it happens, but no Mortal to this Day could ever find that Place again, tho' it be upon part of the Colonel's own Possessions. And so it rests, till Time and thicker Settlements discover it.</p>

                     <p>§. 51. Thus the Company of Adventurers having, by those frequent Acts of Mismanagement, met with vast Losses and Misfortunes; Many grew sick of it, and parted with their Shares; and others came into their Places, and promoted the sending in fresh Recruits of Men and Goods. But the chief Design of all Parties concern'd was to fetch away the Treasure from thence, aiming more at sudden Gain, than to form any regular Colony, or establish a Settlement in such a Manner, as to make it a lasting Happiness to the Country.</p>
                     <p>Several Gentlemen went over upon their particular Stocks, separate from that of the Company, with their own Servants and Goods, each designing to obtain Land from the Government, as Capt. <hi rend="italics">Newport</hi> had done; or, at least, to obtain Patents according to the Regulation for granting Lands to Adventurers. Others sought their Grants of the Company in <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> and obtain'd Authorities and Jurisdictions, as well as Land, distinct from the Authority of the Government, which was the Foundation of great Disorder, and the Occasion of their following Misfortunes. Among others, one Capt. <hi rend="italics">Martin,</hi> having made very considerable Preparations towards a Settlement,
<pb n="46"/>
obtain'd a suitable Grant of Land, and was made of the Council there. But he grasping still at more, hanker'd after Dominion, as well as Possession, and caused so many Differences, that at last he put all Things into Distraction; insomuch, that the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> still seeking Revenge, took Advantage of these Dissentions, and fell foul again of the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> gratifying their Vengence with new Bloodshed.</p>

The fatal Consequences of the Company's Male-Administration cried so loud, that King <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> the First, coming to the Crown of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> had a tender Concern for the poor People that had been betray'd thither, and lost. Upon which Consideration he dissolv'd the Company in the Year 1626, reducing the Country and Government into his own immediate Direction, appointing the Governour and Council himself, and ordering all Patents and Process to issue in his own Name; reserving only to himself an easie Quit-Rent of Two Shillings for every Hundred Acres of Land, and so <hi rend="italics">pro rato.</hi>

THE Country being thus taken into the King's Hands, his Majesty was pleased to establish the Constitution to be by a Governour, Council and Assembly, and to confirm the former Methods and Jurisdictions of the several Courts, as they had been appointed in the Year 1620, and placed the last Resort in the Assembly. He likewise confirm'd the Rules and Orders made by the first Assembly for apportioning the Land, and granting Patents to particular Adventurers.</p>

                     <p>§. 54. This was a Constitution according to their Hearts Desire, and Things seem'd now to go on in a happy Course for Encouragement of the Colony. People flock'd over thither apace; every one took up Land by Patent to his Liking; and, not minding any thing but to be Masters of great Tracts of Land, they planted themselves separately on their several Plantations. Nor did they fear the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> but kept them at a greater Distance than formerly: And they for their Parts, seeing the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> so sensibly increase in Number, were glad to keep their Distance, and be peaceable.</p>
                     <p>This Liberty of taking up Land, and the Ambition each Man had of being Lord of a vast, tho' unimprov'd Territory, together with the Advantage of the many Rivers, which afford a commodious
<pb n="48"/>
Road for Shipping at every Man's Door, has made the Country fall into such an unhappy Settlement and Course of Trade; that to this Day they have not any one Place of Cohabitation among them, that may reasonably bear the Name of a Town.</p>

                     <p>§. 55. The Constitution being thus firmly established, and continuing its Course regularly for some time, People began to lay aside all Fears of any future Misfortune. Several Gentlemen of Condition went over with their whole Families; some for bettering their Estates; others for Religion, and other Reasons best known to themselves. Among those, the Noble <hi rend="italics">Caecilius Calvert,</hi> Lord <hi rend="italics">Baltemore,</hi> a Roman Catholick, thought for the more quiet Exercise of his Religion to retire, with his Family, into that new World. For this Purpose he went to <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> to try how he liked the Place: But the People there look'd upon him with an evil Eye, on Account of his Religion, for which alone he sought this Retreat; and by their ill Treatment discouraged him from settling in that Country.</p>

And finding Land enough up the Bay of <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak,</hi> which was likewise bless'd with many brave Rivers, and as yet altogether uninhabited by the <hi rend="italics">English;</hi> he began to think of making a new Plantation of his own. And for his more certain Direction in obtaining a Grant of it, he undertook a Journey Northward, to discover the Land up the Bay, and observe what might most conveniently square with his Intent.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship finding all Things in this Discovery according to his Wish, return'd to <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> And because the <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> Settlements at that Time reached no further than the South Side of <hi rend="italics">Patowmeck</hi>

                     <p>By this unhappy Accident, a Country which Nature had so well contriv'd for one, became Two seperate Governments. This produced a most unhappy Inconvenience to both; for, these Two being the only Countries under the Dominion of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> that plant Tobacco in any Quantity, the Consequence of that Division is, that when one Colony goes about to prohibit the Trash of that Commodity, to help the Market, then the other, to take Advantage of that Market, pours into <hi rend="italics">England</hi> all they can make, both good and bad, without Distinction. This is very injurious to the other Colony, which had voluntarily suffer'd so great a Diminution in the Quantity to mend the Quality.</p>

Neither was this all the Mischief that happen'd to poor <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> upon this Grant; for the Example of it had dreadful Consequences, and was in the End one of the Occasions of another Massacre by the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> For this Precedent of my Lord <hi rend="italics">Baltemore</hi>'s Grant, which intrench'd upon the Charters and Bounds of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> was Hint enough
<pb n="50"/>
for other Courtiors, (who never intended a Settlement, as my Lord did) to find out something of the same kind to make Money of. This was the Occasion of several very large Defalcations from <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> within a few Years afterwards; which were forwarded and assisted by the Contrivance of the Governour Sir <hi rend="italics">John Harvey.</hi> Insomuch, that not only the Land it self, Quit-Rents and all: But the Authorities and Jurisdictions that belonged to that Colony, were given away; nay, sometimes in those unjust Grants he included the very Settlements that had been before made; countenancing them with the usual Pretence of his Majesty's Instructions.</p>

He improved the Fines and Penalties, which the unwary Assemblies of those Times had given chiefly to himself. He was so haughty and furious to the Council, and to the best Gentlemen of the Country, that his Tyranny grew at last unsupportable; so that in the Year 1639, the Council sent him a Prisoner to <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> and with him Two of their Number to maintain the Articles against him. This News being brought to King <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> the First, his Majesty was very much displeased; and, without hearing any thing, caused him to return Governour again: But by the next Shipping he was graciously pleased to change him; and so made Amends for this Man's Male-Administration, by sending in the good and just Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> to succeed him.</p>

<pb n="51"/>
in Confusion. The subtle <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who took all Advantages, resented the Incroachments upon them by his Grants. They see the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> uneasie and disunited among themselves, and by the Direction of <hi rend="italics">Oppecancanough</hi> their King, laid the Ground-work of another Massacre; wherein by Surprize they cut off near Five Hundred Christians more. But this Execution did not take so general Effect as formerly; because the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> were not so frequently suffer'd to come among the inner Habitations of the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi> And therefore the Massacre fell severest on the South-side of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, and on the Heads of the other Rivers; but chiefly of <hi rend="italics">York</hi> River, where the Emperor <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough</hi> kept the Seat of his Government.</p>

Tho' he had no Advantage of Literature, (that being no where to be found among the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi>) yet he was perfectly skilld in the Art of Governing his rude Country-men. He caused all the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> far and near to dread his Name, and had them all entirely in Subjection.</p>
                     <p>This King in <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi>'s History is call'd Brother to <hi rend="italics">Powhatan,</hi> but by the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> he was not so esteem'd.

Effect; and such as did, were subjected to the settled Conditions of the other Parts of the Government, and made liable to the Payment of the full Quit-Rents.

                     <p>§. 63. <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough,</hi> by his great Age, and the Fatigues of War, (in which Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> follow'd him close) was now grown so decrepit, that he was not able to walk alone; but was carried about by his Men, where-ever he had a Mind to move. His Flesh was all macerated, his Sinews slacken'd, and his Eye-lids became so heavy, that he could not see, but as they were lifted up by his Servants. In this low Condition he was, when Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> hearing that he was at some Distance from his usual Habitation, resolved at all Adventures to seize his Person, which he happily effected. For, with a Party of Horse he made a speedy March, surprized him in his Quarters, and brought him Prisoner to <hi rend="italics">James-Town;</hi> where, by the Governour's Command, he was treated with all the Respect and Tenderness imaginable. Sir <hi rend="italics">William</hi> had a mind to send him to <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> hoping to get Reputation, by presenting his Majesty with a Royal Captive; who at his Pleasure, could call into the Field Ten times more <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> than Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> had <hi rend="italics">English</hi> in his whole Government. Besides, he thought this ancient Prince wou'd be an Instance of the Healthiness and long Life of the Natives of that Country. However, he could not preserve his Life above a Fortnight; For one of the Soldiers, resenting the Calamities the Colony had suffer'd by this Prince's
<pb n="53"/>
Means, basely shot him thro' the Back, after he was made Prisoner; of which Wound he died.</p>
                     <p>He continued brave to the last Moment of his Life, and show'd not the least Dejection at his Captivity. He heard one Day a great Noise of the Treading of People about him; upon which he caused his Eye-lids to be lifted up; and finding that a Crowd of People were let in to see him, he call'd in high Indignation for the Governour; who being come, <hi rend="italics">Oppechancanough</hi> scornfully told him, That had it been his Fortune to take Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> Prisoner, he should not meanly have exposed him as a Show to the People.</p>

After this, Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> made a new Peace with the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> which continued for a long time unviolated; insomuch, that all the Thoughts of future Injury from them were laid aside. But he himself did not long enjoy the Benefit of this profound Peace: For, the unhappy Troubles of King <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> the First encreasing in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> proved a great Disturbance to him and to all the People. They, to prevent the Infection from reaching that Country, made severe Laws against the <hi rend="italics">Puritans,</hi> tho' there were as yet none among them. But all Correspondence with <hi rend="italics">England</hi> was interrupted, the Supplies lessen'd, and Trade obstructed. In a Word, all People were impatient to know what would be the Event of so much Confusion.</p>

However, his Authority was not acknowledged in <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> for several Years after, till they were forced to it by the last Necessity. For in the Year 1651, by <hi rend="italics">Cromwell</hi>'s Command, Capt. <hi rend="italics">Dennis,</hi> with a Squadron of Men of War, arriv'd there from the <hi rend="italics">Carribbee</hi>
                        <pb n="54"/>
Islands, where they had been subduing <hi rend="italics">Bardoes.</hi> The Country at first held out vigorously against him; and Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley,</hi> by the Assistance of such <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> Vessels as were then there, made a brave Resistance. But at last <hi rend="italics">Dennis</hi> contriv'd a Stratagem, which betray'd the Country. He had got a considerable Parcel of Goods aboard, which belong'd to Two of the Council; and found a Method of informing them of it. By this means they were reduced to the <hi rend="italics">Dilemma</hi> either of submitting, or losing their Goods. This occasion'd Factions among them; so that at last, after the Surrender of all the other <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Plantations, Sir <hi rend="italics">William</hi> was forced to submit to the Usurper on the Terms of a general Pardon. However, it ought to be remember'd, to his Praise, and to the immortal Honour of that Colony, that it was the last of all the King's Dominions that submitted to the Usurpation, and afterwards the first that cast it off.</p>

                     <p>§. 66. <hi rend="italics">Oliver</hi> had no sooner subdued the Plantations; but he began to contrive how to keep them under, that so they might never be able for the Time to come to give him further Trouble. To this End he thought it necessary to break off their Correspondence with all other Nations; thereby to prevent their being furnish'd with Arms, Ammunition, and other Warlike Provisions. According to this Design, he contrived a severe Act of Parliament, whereby he prohibited the Plantations from receiving or exporting any <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Commodities, but what should be carried to them by <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Men, and in <hi rend="italics">English</hi> built Ships. They were absolutely forbid corresponding with any Nation or Colony, not subject to the Crown of <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> Neither was any Alien suffer'd to manage
<pb n="55"/>
a Trade or Factory in any of them. In all which Things the Plantations had been till then indulged, for their Encouragement.</p>

                     <p>§. 67. Notwithstanding this Act of Navigation, the Protector never thought the Plantations enough secured; but frequently changed their Governours, to prevent their intriguing with the People. So that during the small time of his Protectorship, they had no less than Three Governours there, namely, <hi rend="italics">Diggs, Bennet</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Mathews.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>§. 68. The strange Arbitrary Curbs he put upon the Plantations, exceedingly afflicted the People. He had the Inhumanity to forbid them all manner of Trade and Correspondence with other Nations, at a Time when <hi rend="italics">England</hi> it self was in Distraction; and could neither take off their Commodities, nor supply them sufficiently with its own. Neither had they ever been used to supply them with half the Commodities they expended, or to take off above half the Tobacco they made. Such violent Proceedings made the People desperate, and inspired them with a Desire to use the last Remedy, to relieve themselves from his Lawless Usurpation. In a short time afterwards a fair Opportunity happen'd: For Governor <hi rend="italics">Mathews</hi> died, and no Person was substituted to succeed him in the Government. Whereupon the People apply'd themselves to Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley,</hi> (who had continued all this time upon his own Plantation in a private Capacity) and unanimously chose him their Governour again.</p>

resolved never to serve any Body, but the lawful Heir to the Crown; and that if he accepted the Government, it should be upon their solemn Promise, after his Example to venture their Lives and Fortunes for the King, who was then in <hi rend="italics">France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was their dearest Wish, and therefore with an unanimous Voice they told him, That they were ready to hazard all for the King. Now, this was actually before the King's Return for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and proceeded from a brave Principle of Loyalty, for which they had no Example. Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> embraced their Choice, and forthwith proclaim'd <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> the Second King of <hi rend="italics">England, Scotland, France, Ireland</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> and caused all Process to be issued in his Name. Thus his Majesty was actually King in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> before he was so in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> But it pleased God to restore him soon after to the Throne of his Ancestors; and so that Country escaped being chastised for throwing off the Usurpation.</p>

There is a Tradition, that the King, in Compliment to that Colony, wore at his Coronation a Robe made of the Silk, that was sent from thence.

                     <p>This Plot was brought so near to Perfection, that it was the very Night before the design'd Execution, e're it was discover'd; and then it came out by the Relenting of one of their Accomplices, whose Name was <hi rend="italics">Birkenhead.</hi> This Man was Servant to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Purton,</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Gloucester</hi> County, near which Place, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> at <hi rend="italics">Poplar-Spring,</hi> the Miscreants were to meet the Night following, and put in Execution their horrid Conspiracy.</p>

Which Orders being happily executed, their devilish Plot was defeated. However, there were but a few taken; because several of them making their Escape, turn'd back such of their Fellows as they met on the Road, and prevented most of them from coming up, or from being discover'd.</p>

                     <p>§. 84. Another Misfortune happen'd to the Plantation this Year, which was a new Act of Parliament in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> laying a severer Restraint upon their Supplies than formerly. By this Act they could have no Foreign Goods, which were not first landed in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and carried directly from thence to the Plantations; the former Restraint of importing them only by <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Men, in <hi rend="italics">English</hi> built Shipping, not being thought sufficient.</p>
                     <p>This was a Misfortune that cut with a double Edge; For, First, it reduced their Staple Tobacco to a very low Price; and, Secondly, it raised the Value of <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Goods, to what the Merchants pleased to put upon them.</p>

For this their Assembly could think of no Remedy, but to be even with the Merchants, and make their Tobacco scarce, by prohibiting the Planting of it for one Year; and during that idle Year to invite the People to enter upon Manufactures. But, <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> not concurring in this Project, they were obliged in their own Defence to repeal the Act of Assembly again, and return to their old Drudgery of planting Tobacco.</p>

This, together with the above-mention'd Curbs on Trade, exasperated the People, because now they found themselves under a Necessity, of exchanging their Commodities with the Merchants of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> at their own Terms. The Assembly therefore again attempted the Stint of Tobacco, and past another Act against planting it for One Year: And <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> both agreed to it. But some Accident hindering the Agent of <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> from giving Notice thereof to <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> by the Day appointed, the Governour of that Province proclaim'd the Act void. Altho' every Body there knew, that <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> had fully agreed to all Things required of them. But he took Advantage of this nice Punctilio; because of the Loss such a Diminution would have been to his Annual income; and so all People relaps'd again into the Disease of planting Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> was more nettled at this ill Usage from <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> than at her former absolute Denial. But being conscious of their own low Condition, they were resolved to take all patiently, and by fair Means get Relief, if they could. They therefore appointed Agents to reassume the Treaty, and submitted so low, as to send them to St. <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>'s, then the Residence of the Governour of <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> and the Place where the Assemblies met. Yet all this Condescention could not hold them to their Bargain. The Governour said, He had observ'd his Part of the Agreement, and would not call an Assembly any more upon that Subject.</p>

In the mean while, <hi rend="italics">England</hi> was studious to prevent their receiving Supplies from any other Country. To do that more effectually, it was thought expedient to confine the Trade of that Colony to one Place. But that not being found practicable, because of the many great Rivers that divide their Habitations, and the extraordinary Conveniencies of each; His Majesty sent Directions to build Forts in the several Rivers, and enjoin'd all the Ships to ride under those Forts; and further order'd, that those Places only should be the Ports of Trade.</p>

This Instruction was punctually observed for a Year, and Preparations were made for Ports, by casting up Breast-works, in such Places as the Assembly appointed; and the Shipping did for that time ride at those Places. But the great Fire and Plague happening in <hi rend="italics">London</hi> immediately upon it, made their Supplies that Year very uncertain; and the Terror the People were in, lest the Plague should be brought over with the Goods from <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> prevented them from residing at those Ports, for fear of being all swept away at once. And so every Body was left at Liberty again.</p>

The Assembly were full enough of Resentment, but overlook'd their right Way of Redress. All they cou'd do was to cause Looms and Work-Houses to be set up in the several Counties at the County Charge. They renew'd the Rewards of Silk, and put great Penalties upon every Neglect of making Flax

and Hemp. About this Time they sustain'd some Damage by the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> War; for which Reason they ordered the Forts to be rebuilt of Brick: But having yet no true Notion of the Advantage of Towns, they did not oblige the Ships to ride under them. Which Thing alone well executed, would have answer'd all their Desires.</p>

Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley,</hi> who was always contriving and industrious for the Good of the Country, was not contented to set a useful Example at home, by the Essays he made of Pot-Ash, Flax, Hemp, Silk, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> But was also resolv'd to make new Discoveries abroad amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this End he employ'd a small Company of about Fourteen <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and as many <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi rend="italics">Henry Batt,</hi> to go upon such an Adventure. They set out together from <hi rend="italics">Appamattox,</hi> and in Seven Days March reach'd the Foot of the Mountains The Mountains they first arriv'd at, were not extraordinary high or steep. But, after they had pass'd the first Ridge, they encounter'd others, that seem'd to reach the Clouds, and were so perpendicular and full of Precipices, that sometimes in a whole Day's March, they could not travel Three Miles in a direct Line. In other Places they found large level Plains, and fine <hi rend="italics">Savanna's,</hi> Three or Four Miles wide, in which were an infinite Quantity of Turkies, Deer, Elks and Buffaloes, so gentle and undisturbed, that they had no Fear at the Appearance of the Men: But wou'd suffer them to come almost within Reach of their Hands. There they also found Grapes so prodigiously large, that they seem'd more like Bullace than Grapes. When they travers'd these Mountains, they came to a fine level Country again, and discover'd a Rivulet that descended backwards. Down that Stream they travell'd several Days, till
<pb n="65"/>
they came to old Fields and Cabbins, where the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had lately been; but were supposed to have fled at the Approach of <hi rend="italics">Batt</hi> and his Company. However, the Captain follow'd the old Rule of leaving some Toys in their Cabbins, for them to find at their Return, by which they might know they were Friends. Near to these Cabbins were great Marshes; where the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> which Capt. <hi rend="italics">Batt</hi> had with him, made a Halt, and would positively proceed no further. They said, that not far off from that Place, lived a Nation of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that made Salt, and sold it to their Neighbours. That this was a great and powerful People, which never suffer'd any Strangers to return, that had once discover'd their Towns. Capt. <hi rend="italics">Batt</hi> used all the Arguments he could to get them forward, but in vain. And so, to please those timorous <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> the Hopes of this Discovery were frustrated, and the Detachment was forced to return.</p>

Upon Capt. <hi rend="italics">Batt</hi>'s Report to Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley,</hi> he resolved to make a Journey himself; that so there might be no Hindrance for want of sufficient Authority, as had been in the aforesaid Expedition. To this End he concerted Matters for it, and had pitch'd upon his Deputy-Governour. The Assembly also made an Act to encourage it. But all these Preparations came to nothing, by the Confusion which happen'd there soon after by <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Rebellion. And since that, there has never been any such Discovery attempted from <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi>

                     <p>92. The Occasion of this Rebellion is not easie to be discover'd: But 'tis certain there were many Things that concurr'd towards it. For it cannot be imagined, that upon the Instigation of Two or
<pb n="66"/>
Three Traders only, who aim'd at a Monoply of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Trade, as some pretend to say, the whole Country would have fallen into so much Distraction; in which People did not only hazard their Necks by Rebellion: But endeavour'd to ruine a Governour, whom they all entirely loved, and had unanimously chosen; a Gentleman who had devoted his whole Life and Estate to the Service of the Country; and against whom in Thirty Five Years Experience, there had never been one single Complaint. Neither can it be supposed, that upon so slight Grounds, they would make Choice of a Leader they hardly knew, to oppose a Gentleman, that had been so long, and so deservedly the Darling of the People. So that in all Probability there was something else in the Wind, without which the Body of the Country had never been engaged in that Insurrection.</p>
                     <p>Four Things may be reckon'd to have been the main Ingredients towards this intestine Commotion, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> First, The extream low Price of Tobacco, and the ill Usage of the Planters in the Exchange of Goods for it, which the Country, with all their earnest Endeavours, could not remedy. Secondly, The Splitting the Colony into Proprieties, contrary to the original Charters; and the extravagant Taxes they were forced to undergo, to relieve themselves from those Grants. Thirdly, The heavy Restraints and Burdens laid upon their Trade by Act of Parliament in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> Fourthly, The Disturbance given by the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> Of all which I beg Leave to speak in their Order.</p>

                     <p>§. 93. First, Of the low Price of Tobacco, and the Disappointment of all sort of Remedy, I have spoken sufficiently before. Secondly, Of splitting the Country into Proprieties.</p>
                     <pb n="67"/>
                     <p>King <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> the Second, to gratifie some Nobles about him, made Two great Grants out of that Country. These Grants were not of the uncultivated Wood-Land only, but also of Plantations, which for many Years had been seated and improv'd, under the Encouragement of several Charters granted by his Royal Ancestors to that Colony. Those Grants were distinguished by the Names of the Northern and Southern Grants of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> and the same Men were concern'd in both. They were kept dormant some Years after they were made, and in the Year 1674 begun to be put in Execution. As soon as ever the Country came to know this, they remonstrated against them; and the Assembly drew up an humble Address to his Majesty, complaining of the said Grants, as derogatory to the previous Charters and Privileges granted to that Colony, by his Majesty and his Royal Progenitors. They sent to <hi rend="italics">England</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi rend="italics">Ludwell</hi> and Colonel <hi rend="italics">Park,</hi> as their Agents to address the King to vacate those Grants. And the better to defray that Charge, they laid a Tax of Fifty Pounds of Tobacco <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Poll, for Two Years together, over and above all other Taxes, which was an excessive Burden. They likewise laid Amercements of Seventy, Fifty, and Thirty Pounds of Tobacco on every Cause tried throughout the Country. Besides all this, they applied the Ballance, remaining due upon Account of the Two Shilling <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Hogshead, and Fort Duties, to this Use. Which Taxes and Amercements fell heaviest on the poor People, the Effect of whose Labour wou'd not cloath their Wives and Children. This made them desperately uneasie, especially when, after a whole Year's Patience under all these Pressures, they had no Encouragement from their Agents in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> to hope for Remedy; nor any Certainty when they should be eased of those heavy Impositions.</p>

                     <p>§. 94. Thirdly, Upon the Back of all these Misfortunes came out the Act of 25 <hi rend="italics">Car.</hi> II. for better securing the Plantation Trade. By this Act several Duties were laid on the Trade from one Plantation to another. This was a new Hardship, and the rather, because the Revenue arising by this Act, was not applied to the Use of the Plantation wherein it was raised: But given clear away; nay, in that Country it seem'd to be of no other Use, but to create a good Income to the Officers; for the Collector had Half, the Comptroller a Quarter, and the remaining Quarter was subdivided into Salaries, till it was lost.</p>
                     <p>By the same Act also very great Duties were laid on the Fisheries of the Plantations, if manufactured by the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Inhabitants there; while the People of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> were absolutely free from all Customs. Nay, tho' the Oil, Blubber, and Whale-Bone, which were made by the Inhabitants of the Plantations, were carried to <hi rend="italics">England</hi> by <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Men, and in <hi rend="italics">English</hi> built Ships, yet it was held to a considerable Duty.</p>

                     <p>§. 95. These were the Afflictions that Country labour'd under, when the Fourth Accident happen'd, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> The Disturbance offer'd by the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> to the Frontiers.</p>
                     <p>This was occasion'd, First, By the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> on the Head of the Bay. Secondly, By the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> on their own Frontiers.</p>
                     <p>First, The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> at the Head of the Bay drove a constant Trade with the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Monadas,</hi> now call'd <hi rend="italics">New-York;</hi> and, to carry on this, they used to come and return every Year by their Frontiers of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> to purchase Skins and Furs of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> to the Southward. This Trade was carried on peaceably while the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> held <hi rend="italics">Monadas;</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                        <pb n="69"/>
used to call on the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> to whom they would sell part of their Furs, and with the rest go on to <hi rend="italics">Monados.</hi> But after the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> came to possess that Place, and understood the Advantages the <hi rend="italics">Virginians</hi> made by the Trade of their <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> they inspired them with such a Hatred to the Inhabitants of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> that, instead of coming peaceably to trade with them, as they had done for several Years before, they afterwards never came, but only to commit Robberies and Murders upon the People.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> upon their own Frontiers were likewise inspir'd with ill Thoughts of 'em. For their <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Merchants had lost a considerable Branch of their Trade they knew not how; and apprehended the Consequences of Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi>'s intended Discoveries, which were espoused by the Assembly, and might take away the remaining Part of their Profit. This made them very troublesome to the Neighbour <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> who on their part, observing an unusual Uneasiness in the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and being terrified by their rough Usage, immediately suspected some wicked Design against their Lives, and so fled to their remoter Habitations. This confirm'd the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> in the Belief, that they had been the Murderers, till at last they provoked them to be so in Earnest.</p>

                     <p>§. 96. This Addition of Mischief to Minds already full of Discontent, made People ready to vent all their Resentment against the poor <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> There was nothing to be got by Tobacco; neither could they turn any other Manufacture to Advantage; so that most of the poorer Sort were willing to quit their unprofitable Employments, and go Voluntiers against the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi>

                     <p>At first they flock'd together tumultuously, running in Troops from one Plantation to another without a Head; till at last the seditious Humour of Colonel <hi rend="italics">Nath. Bacon,</hi> led him to be of the Party. This Gentleman had been brought up at one of the Inns of Court in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and had a moderate Fortune. He was young, bold, active, of an inviting Aspect, and powerful Elocution. In a Word, he was every way qualified to head a giddy and unthinking Multitude. Before he had been Three Years in the Country, he was, for his extraordinary Qualifications, made one of the Council, and in great Honour and Esteem among the People. For this Reason he no sooner gave Countenance to this riotous Mob, but they all presently fix'd their Eyes upon him for their General, and accordingly made their Addresses to him. As soon as he found this, he harangued them publickly. He aggravated the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Mischiefs, complaining, that they were occasion'd for want of a due Regulation of their Trade. He recounted particularly the other Grievances and Pressures they lay under; and pretended, that he accepted of their Command with no other Intention, but to do them and the Country Service, in which he was willing to encounter the greatest Difficulties and Dangers. He farther assured them, he would never lay down his Arms, till he had revenged their Sufferings upon the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and redress'd all their other Grievances.</p>

He took care to exasperate them to the utmost, by representing all their Misfortunes. After he had begun to muster them, he dispatch'd a Messenger to the Governour, by whom he aggravated the Mischiefs done by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and desired a
<pb n="71"/>
Commission of General to go out against them. This Gentleman was in so great Esteem at that Time with the Council, that the Governour did not think fit to give him a flat Refusal: But sent him Word, he would consult the Council, and return him a further Answer.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 98. In the mean time, <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi> was expeditious in his Preparations, and having all Things in Readiness, began his March, depending on the Authority the People had given him. He would not lose so much Time, as to stay for his Commission; but dispatched several Messengers to the Governour to hasten it. On the other Hand, the Governour, instead of a Commission, sent positive Orders to him to disperse his Men, and come down in Person to him, upon Pain of being declared a Rebel.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 99. This unexpected Order, was a great Surprize to <hi rend="italics">Bacon,</hi> and not a little Trouble to his Men. However, he was resolved to prosecute his first Intentions, depending upon his Strength, and Interest with the People. Nevertheless, he intended to wait upon the Governour, but not altogether defenceless. Pursuant to this Resolution, he took about Forty of his Men down with him in a Sloop to <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> where the Governour was with his Council.</p>
                  </div>

For which being suspended from the Council, he went away again in a Huff with his Sloop and Followers. The Governour fill'd a Long-Boat with Men, and pursued the Sloop so close, that Colonel <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi> removed into his Boat to make more Haste.
<pb n="72"/>
But the Governour had sent up by Land to the Ships at <hi rend="italics">Sandy-Point,</hi> where he was stopp'd, and sent down again. Upon his Return he was kindly received by the Governour, who, knowing he had gone a Step beyond his Instructions in having suspended him, was glad to admit him again of the Council; after which he hoped all Things might be pacified.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 101. Notwithstanding this, Col. <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi> still insisted upon a Commission to be General of the Voluntiers, and to go out against the <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> from which the Governour endeavour'd to disswade him, but to no Purpose, because he had some secret Project in View. He had the Luck to be countenanced in his Importunities, by the News of fresh Murder and Robberies committed by the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> However, not being able to accomplish his Ends by fair Means, he stole privately out of Town; and having put himself at the Head of Six Hundred Voluntiers, marched directly to <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> where the Assembly was then sitting. He presented himself before the Assembly, and drew up his Men in Battalia before the House wherein they sat. He urged to them his Preparations; and alledged, that if the Commission had not been delay'd so long, the War against the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> might have been finish'd.</p>

The Governour resented this insolent Usage worst of all, and now obstinately refused to grant him any thing, offering his naked Breast against the presented Arms of his Followers. But the Assembly, fearing the fatal Consequence of provoking a discontented Multitude ready arm'd, who had the Governour, Council and Assembly entirely in their Power, address'd the Governour to grant <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi> his Request. They prepar'd themselves the Commission,
<pb n="73"/>
constituting him General of the Forces of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> and brought it to the Governour to be sign'd.</p>
                     <p>With much Reluctancy his Excellency sign'd it, and thereby put the Power of War and Peace into <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Hands. Upon this he march'd away immediatly, having gain'd his End, which was in effect a Power to secure a Monopoly of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Trade to himself and his Friends.</p>

As soon as General <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi> had march'd to such a convenient Distance from <hi rend="italics">James-Town,</hi> that the Assembly thought they might deliberate with Safety, the Governour, by their Advice, issued a Proclamation of Rebellion against him, commanding his Followers to surrender him, and forthwith disperse themselves. Not contented with this, he likewise gave Orders at the same time, for raising the Militia of the Country against him.</p>

Therefore, they kept to their Arms, and instead of proceeding against the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> they march'd back to <hi rend="italics">James-Town;</hi> directing their Fury against such of their Friends and Country-men, as should dare to oppose them.</p>

But there, instead of People's receiving him with open Arms, in Remembrance of the former Services he had done them; they began to make Terms with him for Redress of their Grievances, and for the Ease

Thus Sir <hi rend="italics">William,</hi> who had been almost the Idol of the People, was, by reason of the loyal Part he acted, abandon'd by all; except some few, who went over to him from the Western Shore in Sloops and Boats.

By this Means there happen'd some Skirmishes, in which several were kill'd, and others taken Prisoners.

He made formal Articles of Peace with the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and held an Assembly at <hi rend="italics">Middle-Plantation,</hi> wherein they settled and allow'd a free Trade with the <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> but restrain'd it to certain Marts, to which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> should bring their Commodities: And this also to be under such certain Rules as were by that Assembly directed.

For, had they permitted this Custom to become habitual, and thus engross'd the Shipping, as wou'd soon have happen'd, they could easily have regulated the Trade of Tobacco at any Time, without the Concurrence of those other Colonies, and without submitting to their perverse Humours, as formerly.</p>

In these he had the Art of mixing the Good of the Country with his own particular Interest, which was a sure Means of getting them pass'd. And coming with the Advantage of restoring Peace to a troubled Nation, it was not difficult for him to obtain whatever he pleased from the People. His Influence too was the greater; by the Power he had of pardoning those who had a Hand in the Disorders committed in the late Rebellion.</p>

                     <p>§. 118. In his first Assembly he pass'd several Acts very obliging to the Country, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> First, An Act of Naturalization, whereby the Power of Naturalizing
<pb n="81"/>
Foreigners was placed in the Governour. Secondly, An Act for Cohabitation, and Encouragement of Trade and Manufactures; whereby a certain Place in each County was appointed for a Town, in which all Goods imported, and exported were to be landed and shipp'd off, bought and sold. Which Act was kindly brought to nothing by the Opposition of the Merchants of <hi rend="italics">London.</hi> Thirdly, An Act of general Pardon and Oblivion, whereby all the Transgressions and Outrages committed in the Time of the late Rebellion, were entirely remitted; and Reparation allow'd to People that should be evil spoken of on that Account.</p>
                     <p>But he put a Sting into the Tail of this Law, that justifies Oppression, whenever the People happen to fall into the Hands of an ill Governour. I mean the Clause that imposes a Penalty of Five Hundred Pounds, and a Year's Imprisonment, upon any Man that shall presume to speak disrespectfully of the Governour. This is such a Safeguard to Tyranny, that, let a Governour commit never so many Abuses, no Person, while he is there, dare say a Word against him; nor so much as go about to represent it to the Throne of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> for Redress, for fear of incurring this severe Penalty.</p>
                     <p>The same Law also gives One Hundred Pounds, and Three Months Imprisonment, without Bail, for daring to speak or write disrespectfully of any one of the Council, or of any Judge, or other principal Officer in the Country.</p>
                     <p>Although this Law was at first intended merely to suppress Rebellion, and to pacifie and reconcile the People one towards another; and no Governour hath ever thought fit to put that Clause in Execution: Yet it has of late been trump'd up in Revenge of Personal Injuries, and for Support of the heavy Mismanagements, which the Country now groans under.</p>

By passing some Laws that obliged the Country, the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper</hi> carried one that was very pleasing to himself, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> The Act for raising a publick Revenue for the better Support of the Government. By this he got the Duties contain'd therein to be made perpetual; and that the Money which before used to be accounted for to the Assembly, should be from thenceforth disposed of by his Majesty's sole Direction, for the Support of the Government. When this was done, he obtain'd of the King a Salary of Two Thousand Pounds <hi rend="italics">per Annum,</hi> instead of One Thousand, which was formerly allow'd. Also One Hundred and Fifty Pounds <hi rend="italics">per Annum</hi> for House-Rent, besides all the usual Perquisites.</p>

                     <p>§. 120. In those submissive Times his Lordship reduced the greatest Perquisite of his Place to a Certainty, which before that was only Gratuitous; that is, instead of the Masters of Ships making Presents of Liquors or Provisions towards the Governour's House-keeping, as they were wont to do, he demanded a certain Sum of Money, remitting that Custom. This Rate has ever since been demanded of all Commanders as a Duty; and is Twenty Shillings for each Ship or Vessel, under an Hundred Tuns, and Thirty Shillings for each Ship upwards of that Burden, to be paid every Voyage, or Port-clearing.</p>

                     <p>§. 121. This Noble Lord was skilful in all the Ways of getting Money, and never let slip any Opportunity of doing it. To this End he seem'd to lament the unhappy State of the Country, in relation to their Coin. He was tenderly concern'd that all their Cash should be drain'd away by the Neighbouring Colonies, which had not set so low an Estimate
<pb n="83"/>
upon it as <hi rend="italics">Virginia;</hi> and therefore he proposed the Raising of it.</p>
                     <p>This was what the Country had formerly desired, and the Assembly was at that time making a Law for it: But his Lordship stopt them, alledging it was the King's Prerogative, by Virtue of which he won'd do it by Proclamation. This they did not approve of, well knowing, if that were the Case, his Lordship, and every other Governour, would at any time have the same Prerogative of altering it; and so People shou'd never be at any Certainty, as they quickly after found from his own Practice. For his Drift in all this Proceeding, tho' gilded over with an affected Kindness to the Country, was only to make Advantage of paying the Soldiers; the Money for that Purpose being put into his Lordship's Hands. He had prudently provided light Pieces of Eight, which he with this View had bought at a cheap Rate. When his Contrivance was ripe for Execution, he extended the Royal Prerogative, and issued forth a Proclamation, for raising the Value of Pieces of Eight from Five to Six Shillings; and as soon as they were admitted current at that Value, he produced an Order for paying and disbanding the Soldiers. Then those poor Fellows, and such as had maintain'd them, were forced to take their Pay, in those light Pieces of Eight, at Six Shillings. But his Lordship soon after himself found the Inconvenience of that Proclamation; for People began to pay their Duties, and their Ship-Money, in Coin of that high Estimate, which was like to cut short both his Lordship's Salary, and Perquisites; and so he was forced to make use of the same Prerogative, to reduce the Money again to its former Standard.</p>

                     <p>§. 122. According to this Despotick way of Government, this Noble Lord tried another Experiment in the tender Part of their Constitution: But did it so cautiously, that it seem'd to take off all Reflection.</p>
                     <p>He put out a Proclamation to repeal several Laws, which had been made since <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Rebellion: But all of them related to the Transactions of <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Time, and were virtually, tho' not expresly repeal'd, by the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion.</p>
                  </div>

However, this Arbitrary Method of doing Business, had like to have had a very unhappy Effect; insomuch, that if the late Misfortunes of <hi rend="italics">Bacon,</hi> had not been so fresh in Memory, it might, perhaps, have occasion'd a new Commotion. For, at this rate of proceeding, People look'd upon their Acts of Assembly, to be of no more Force, than the Laws of an <hi rend="italics">Ottoman</hi> Province, which are liable to be suspended or repeal'd, at the Pleasure of the <hi rend="italics">Bashaw.</hi> In short, it bred such a Mutiny in the Country, that the succeeding Assembly was forced to make a particular Law, to provide against the ill Consequences of it.</p>
                     <p>Some few Instances of repealing Acts of Assembly after this absolute manner, were also attempted in the Time of the Lord <hi rend="italics">Effingham</hi>'s Government. But, notwithstanding his Proclamations, the Laws thereby pretended to be repeal'd, are allow'd to be of as great Force in all Courts of Justice, as they were before those Proclamations; the Law for paying the Quit-Rent only excepted. This Law allowed them to pay Quit-Rents in Tobacco at Two Pence <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Pound; but Tobacco after that falling low, the Proclamation repeal'd that Law, and demanded the Payment in Money, according to the Tenour of their Patents; or else in Tobacco
<pb n="85"/>
at One Penny <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Pound. And this Imposition has been generally submitted to, rather than any single Man would stand a Law-Suit against a Governour; especially seeing that by the Words of his Patent, the Quit-Rent was reserved in Money.</p>
                     <p>Afterward Colonel <hi rend="italics">Nicholson,</hi> when he was Lieutenant-Governour under the same Lord <hi rend="italics">Effingham,</hi> among the many Arbitrary Proceedings which he boasts to have learn'd formerly in the Kingdom of <hi rend="italics">Morocco,</hi> was pleased by his Proclamation officiously to repeal a Law, which had been before repeal'd to his Hand, by another Law. And these are all the Attempts that have been made in that Colony, of the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Method of governing by Edicts.</p>

                     <p>The Country being then settled again, made too much Tobacco for the Market; and the Merchants, would hardly allow the Planter any thing for it.</p>
                     <p>This occasion'd much Uneasiness again, and the People, from former Experience, despairing of succeeding in any Agreement with the Neighbouring Governments, resolved a total Destruction of the Tobacco in that Country, especially of the Sweet-scented; because that was planted no where else. In Pursuance of which Design, they contrived, that all the Plants should be destroy'd, while they were yet in the Beds, and after it was too late to sow more.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the Ring-leaders in this Project began with their own first, and then went to cut up the Plants of such of their Neighbours as were not willing to do it themselves. However, they had not Resolution enough to go through with their Work.</p>
                     <pb n="86"/>
                     <p>This was adjudged Sedition and Felony. Several People were committed upon it, and some condemn'd to be hang'd. And afterwards the Assembly pass'd a Law to make such Proceedings Felony for the future.</p>

                     <p>§. 125. After this Accident of Plant-cutting, the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper</hi> return'd, and held his Second Assembly, in which he contrived to gain another great Advantage over the Country. His Lordship in his first Voyage thither, perceiving how easily he could twist and manage the People, conceived new Hopes of retrieving the Propriety of the Northern Neck, as being so small a Part of the Colony. He conceiv'd that while the Remainder escaped free, which was far the greater Part, they would not engage in the Interest of the lesser Number; especially considering the Discouragements they had met with, before in their former Sollicitation: Tho' all this while, and for many Years afterwards, his Lordship did not pretend to lay publick Claim to any Part of the Propriety.</p>
                     <p>It did not square with this Project that Appeals should be made to the General Assembly, as till then had been the Custom. He fear'd the Burgesses would be too much in the Interest of their Country-men, and adjudge the inhabitants of the Northern Neck, to have an equal Liberty and Privilege in their Estates, with the rest of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> as being settled upon the same Foot. In order therefore to make a better Pennyworth of those poor People, he studied to overturn this odious Method of Appealing, and to fix the last Resort in another Court, that night judge more favourably of his unrighteous Patents.</p>
                     <p>To bring this Point about, his Lordship contrived to blow up a Difference in the Assembly, between the Council and the Burgesses, privately
<pb n="87"/>
encouraging the Burgesses, to insist upon the Privilege of determining all Appeals by themselves, exclusive of the Council; because they, having given their Opinions before in the General Court, were for that Reason, unfit Judges in Appeals from themselves to the Assembly. This succeeded according to his Wish, and the Burgesses bit at the Bait, under the Notion of Privilege, never dreaming of the Snake that lay in the Grass, nor considering the Danger of altering an old Constitution so abruptly. Thus that cunning Lord gain'd his End; for he represented that Quarrel with so many Aggravations, that he got an Instruction from the King, to take away all Appeals from the General Court to the Assembly, and cause them to be made to himself in Council.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 126. Of this his Lordship made sufficient Advantage; for in the Confusion that happen'd in the End of King <hi rend="italics">James</hi> the Second's Reign, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> in <hi rend="italics">October,</hi> 1688, he got an Assignment from the other Patentees, and gain'd a favourable Report from the King's Council, upon his Patent for the Northern Neck.</p>
                     <p>When he had succeeded in this, his Lordship's next Step was to engage some noted Inhabitant of the Place to be on his Side. Accordingly he made use of his Cousin Secretary <hi rend="italics">Spencer,</hi> who liv'd in the said Neck. This Gentleman did but little in his Lordship's Service, and only gain'd some few Strays, that used to be claim'd by the Coroner, in Behalf of the King.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Death of Mr. Secretary <hi rend="italics">Spencer,</hi> he engaged another noted Gentleman, an old Stander in that Country, Col. <hi rend="italics">Philip Ludwell,</hi> who was then in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> He went over with this Grant in the Year 1690, and set up an Office in the Neck, claiming some Escheats; but he likewise could make nothing of it. After him Col. <hi rend="italics">George Brent</hi> and Col. <hi rend="italics">William</hi>
                        <pb n="88"/>
                        <hi rend="italics">Fitz-Hugh,</hi> that were likewise Inhabitants of the said Neck, were employ'd in that Affair: But succeeded no better than their Predecessors. The People in the mean while, complain'd frequently to their Assemblies, who at last made another Address to the King; but there being no Agent in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> to prosecute it, that likewise miscarried. At last Colonel <hi rend="italics">Richard Lee,</hi> one of the Council, an Inhabitant of the Northern Neck, privately made a Composition with the Proprietors themselves for his own Land. This broke the Ice, and several were induced to follow so great an Example; so that by Degrees, they were generally brought to pay their Quit-Rents into the Hands of the Proprietors Agents. And now at last it is managed for them by Col. <hi rend="italics">Robert Carter,</hi> another of the Council, and one of the greatest Freeholders of that Propriety.</p>

It seems, Nicety of Pleading, with all the Juggle of <hi rend="italics">Westminster-Hall,</hi> was creeping into their Courts. The Clerks began in some Cases to enter the Reasons with the Judgments, pretending to set Precedents of inviolable Form to be observed in all future Proceedings. This my Lord found fault with, and retrench'd all Dilatory Pleas, as prejudicial to Justice, keeping the Courts close to the Merits of the Cause, in order to bring it to a speedy Determination, according to the Innocence of former Times. He caused the Judgments to be enter'd up short, without the Reasons, alledging, that their Courts were not of so great Experience, as to be able to make Precedents to Posterity; who ought to be left at Liberty to determine,
<pb n="89"/>
according to the Equity of the Controversie before them.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 128. In his Time also were dismantled the Forts built by Sir <hi rend="italics">Henry Chicheley</hi> at the Heads of the Rivers, and the Forces there were disbanded, as being too great a Charge. The Assembly appointed small Parties of Light Horse in their Stead, to range by Turns upon the Frontiers. These being chosen out of the Neighbouring Inhabitants, might afford to serve at easier Rates, and yet do the Business more effectually.</p>

After this, the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper</hi> return'd again for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> his second Stay not being much longer than the first; and Sir <hi rend="italics">Henry Chicheley</hi> being dead, he irregularly proclaim'd his Kinsman Mr. Secretary <hi rend="italics">Spencer</hi> President, tho' he was not the eldest Member of the Council.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 130. The next Year, being 1684, upon the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper</hi>'s refusing to return, <hi rend="italics">Francis</hi> Lord <hi rend="italics">Howard</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Effingham</hi> was sent over Governour. This Noble Lord had as great an Affection for Money as his Predecessor, and made it his Business to equip himself with as much of it as he could, without Respect either to the Laws of the Plantation, or the Dignity of his Office. His Lordship condescended to share with his Clerk, the meaner Profits of Ministerial Offices. And to serve this Turn the more effectually, he imposed the Charge of a License under Seal, on all School-masters for teaching of Children, and on all Practitioners at the Bar, for Pleading. He also extorted an excessive Fee for putting the Seal, to all Probates of Wills, and Letters of Administration, even where the Estates of the Deceased were of the meanest Value. Neither could any be favour'd with such Administration,
<pb n="90"/>
or Probate, without paying that Extortion. If any Body presum'd to remonstrate against it, his Lordship's Behaviour towards that Man was very severe. He kept several Persons in Prison, and under Confinement from Court to Court, without bringing them to Trial. Which Proceedings, and many others, were so oppressive, that Complaints were made thereof to the King, and Col. <hi rend="italics">Philip Ludwell</hi> was appointed Agent to appear against him in <hi rend="italics">England:</hi> And tho' Col. <hi rend="italics">Ludwell</hi> had not the good Fortune to get his Lordship turn'd out; yet his indefatigable Application in that Affair deserves an honourable Commemoration.</p>

                     <p>§. 131. During the first Session of Assembly in this Noble Lord's Time, the Duty on Liquors imported from the other <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Plantations, was first imposed. It was then laid on Pretence of lessening the Levy by the Poll, for Payment of publick Taxes; but more especially for rebuilding the State-House, which had not been rebuilt, since <hi rend="italics">Lawrence</hi> burnt it in <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Time.</p>
                     <p>This Duty was at first laid on Wine and Rum only, at the Rate of Three Pence <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Gallon, with an Exemption of all such, as should be imported in the Ships of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> Owners. But the like Duty has since been laid on other Liquors also, and is raised to Four Pence <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Gallon on Wine, and Rum, and One Penny <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Gallon on Beer, Cyder, Lime-Juice, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> and the Privilege of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> Owners is quite taken away, to the great Discouragement of their Shipping, and Home Trade.</p>

                     <p>§. 132. This Lord, though he pretended to no great Skill in Legal Proceedings, yet he made great Innovations in their Courts, pretending to follow the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Forms. Thus he created a new Court of <hi rend="italics">Chancery,</hi> distinct from the General Court, who
<pb n="91"/>
had ever before claim'd that Jurisdiction. He erected himself into a Lord Chancellor, taking the Gentlemen of the Council, to sit with him as meer Associates and Advisers, not having any Vote in the Causes before them. And that it might have more the Air of a new Court, he would not so much as sit in the State-House, where all the other publick Business was dispatch'd, but took the Dining-Room of a private House for that Use. He like wise made Arbitrary Tables of Fees, peculiar to this High Court. However, his Lordship not beginning this Project very long before he left the Country, all these Innovations came to an End upon his Removal; and the Jurisdiction return'd to the General Court again, in the Time of Col. <hi rend="italics">Nath. Bacon,</hi> whom he left President.</p>

                     <p>§. 133. During that Gentleman's Presidency, which began <hi rend="italics">Anno</hi> 1689, the Project of a College was first agreed upon. The Contrivers drew up their Scheme, and presented it to the President and Council. This was by them approved, and referr'd to the next Assembly. But Col. <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Administration being very short, and no Assembly call'd all the while, this pious Design cou'd proceed no further.</p>

This Gentleman's Business was to fix himself in my Lord's Place, and recommend himself to the supream Government. For that End, he studied Popularity, discoursing freely of Country Improvements. He made his Court to the People, by instituting Olympick Games, and giving Prizes to all those, that shou'd excel in the Exercises of Riding, Running, Shooting, Wrestling, and Backsword. When the Design of a College was communicated
<pb n="92"/>
to him, he foresaw what Interest it might create him with the Bishops in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and therefore promised it all imaginable Encouragement. The first Thing desired of him in its Behalf, was the Calling of an Assembly; but this he wou'd by no Means agree to, being under Obligations to the Lord <hi rend="italics">Effingham,</hi> to stave off Assemblies as long as he could, for fear there might be further Representations sent over against his Lordship, who was conscious to himself, how uneasie the Country had been under his Despotick Administration.</p>

When that could not be obtain'd, then they proposed, that a Subscription might pass thro' the Colony, to try the Humour of the People in general, and see what voluntary Contributions they could get towards it. This he granted, and he himself, together with the Council, set a generous Example to the other Gentlemen of the Country; so that the Subscriptions at last amounted to about Two Thousand Five Hundred Pounds; in which Sum is included the generous Benevolences of several Merchants of <hi rend="italics">London.</hi>

                     <p>§. 136. <hi rend="italics">Anno</hi> 1691, an Assembly being called, this Design was moved to them, and they espoused it heartily; and soon after made an Address to King <hi rend="italics">William</hi> and Queen <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> in its Behalf, and sent the Reverend Mr. <hi rend="italics">James Blair</hi> their Agent to <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> to sollicite their Majesties Charter for it.</p>
                     <p>It was proposed, that Three Things should be taught in this College, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> Languages, Divinity, and Natural Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>They appointed a certain Number of Professors, and their Salaries.</p>
                     <p>And they form'd Rules for the Continuation, and good Government thereof to Perpetuity. But of this I shall speak more particularly in the last
<pb n="93"/>
Part of my Book, wherein the present State will be consider'd.</p>
                     <p>The Assembly was so fond of Governour <hi rend="italics">Nicholson</hi> at that Time, that they presented him with the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds, as a Testimony of their good Disposition towards him. But he having an Instruction to receive no Present from the Country, they drew up an Address to their Majesties, praying that he might have Leave to accept it.</p>
                     <p>This he took an effectual Way to secure, by making a Promise, that if their Majesties would please to permit him to accept it, he would give one Half thereof to the College; and so he secured at once both the Money, and the Character of being a generous Person.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 137. Their Majesties were well pleased with that pious Design of the Plantation, and granted a Charter, according to their Desire; in obtaining which, the Address and Assiduity of Mr. <hi rend="italics">Blair,</hi> their Agent, was highly to be admired.</p>
                     <p>Their Majesties were graciously pleased, to give near Two Thousand Pounds Sterling, the Ballance due upon the Account of Quit-Rents, towards the Founding the College; and towards the Endowing of it, they allow'd Twenty Thousand Acres of choice Land, together with the Revenue arising by the Penny <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Pound, on Tobacco exported from <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> to the other Plantations.</p>
                     <p>It was a great Satisfaction to the Archbishops and Bishops to see such a Nursery of Religion founded in that new World; especially for that it was begun in an Episcopal Way, and carried on wholly by zealous Conformists to the Ch. of <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>

                     <p>§. 138. in this first Assembly, Lieutenent-Governour <hi rend="italics">Nicholson</hi> pass'd Acts for Encouragement of the
<pb n="94"/>
Linnen Manufacture, and to promote the Leather Trade, by Tanning, Currying, and Shooe-making. He also in that Session pass'd a Law for Cohabitation, and Improvement of Trade.</p>
                     <p>In the General Court, he was a strict Observer of the Acts of Assembly, making them the sole Rule of his Judgment, where-ever they happen'd not to be silent.</p>
                     <p>But his Behaviour in Council at the same time, did not square with that Regularity; For, there he was so Arbitrary and Imperious, that they could not bear it, and several of the Councellors writ Letters to the Court of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> against him. Where, instead of giving Redress to their Grievances, they sent their original Letters back to him.</p>
                     <p>Before the next Assembly he tack'd about, and was quite the Reverse of what he was in the first. Instead of encouraging Ports and Towns, he spread abroad his Dislike of them; and went among the People, finding fault with those Things, which he and the Assembly had unanimously agreed upon the preceding Session. Such a violent Change there was in him, that it surpriz'd every Body at first: But they soon found out, that it proceeded from some other Cause, than barely the Inconstancy of his Temper. Of this last Opinion he continued till his Removal, which happen'd soon after.</p>

He began his Government with an Assembly, which overthrew the good Design of Ports and Towns: But the Ground-work of this Proceeding, was laid before Sir <hi rend="italics">Edmund</hi>'s Arrival. However, this Assembly proceeded no further, than to suspend the Law, till their Majesties Pleasure should be known. But it seems the Merchants in <hi rend="italics">London</hi> were dissatisfied, and
<pb n="95"/>
made publick Complaints against it, which their Majesties were pleased to hear; and afterwards referr'd the Law back to the Assembly again, to consider, if it were suitable to the Circumstances of the Country, and to regulate it accordingly. But the Assembly never proceeded any further in it, and so it lies at this Day.</p>

He caused all the Statutes of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> even those made since their last Charter, notwithstanding they did not mention the Plantations, even such as particularly related to Usages and Customs peculiar to <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> to be Law in their Courts. He set up the Statutes of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> to be the sole Rule of his Judgment, as the Lieutenant-Governour had made the Acts of Assembly, of his. This gave them a new Distraction; so that they knew not what was Law, nor when they were secure in their Estates. He was likewise frequently pleased to say, they had no Title to their Lands, for a Reason which neither himself, nor any Body else knew. These Things caused great Heart-burnings in his Time.</p>

<pb n="96"/>
of Skins, and Furs, for its more plentiful Endowment.</p>
                     <p>The Subscription-Money did not come in with the same Readiness, with which it had been underwritten. However, there was enough given by their Majesties, and gather'd from the People, to keep all Hands at Work, and carry on the Building, the Foundation whereof they then laid.</p>

                     <p>§. 143. Sir <hi rend="italics">Edmund Andros</hi> was a great Encourager of Manufactures. In his Time Fulling-Mills were set up by Act of Assembly. He also gave particular Marks of his Favour towards the Propagating of Cotton, which since his Time has been much neglected. He was likewise a great Lover of Method, and Dispatch in all sorts of Business, which made him find fault with the Management of the Secretaries Office. And, indeed, with very good Reason; for from the Time of <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi>'s Rebellion, till then, there never was any Office in the World more negligently kept. Several Patents of Land were enter'd blank upon Record; many Original Patents, Records, and Deeds of Land, with other Matters of great Consequence, were thrown loose about the Office, and suffer'd to be dirted, torn, and eaten by the Moths, and other Insects. But upon this Gentleman's Accession to the Government, he immediately gave Directions, to reform all these Irregularities; he caused the loose and torn Records of Value to be transcribed into new Books; and order'd Conveniencies to be built within the Office, for preserving the Records from being lost and confounded, as before. He prescribed Methods to keep the Papers dry and clean, and to reduce them into such Order, as that any thing might be turn'd to immediately. But all these Conveniencies were burnt soon after they were finished, in <hi rend="italics">October,</hi> 1698, together
<pb n="97"/>
with the Office it self, and the whole State-House. But his Diligence was so great in that Affair, that tho his Stay afterward in the Country was very short; yet he caused all the Records, and Papers, which had been sav'd from the Fire, to be sorted again, and register'd in Order, and indeed in much better Order, than ever they had been before. In this Condition he left'em at his quitting the Government.</p>
                     <p>He made several Offers to rebuild the State-House in the same Place; and had his Government continued but Six Months longer, 'tis probable he would have effected it after such a manner, as might have been least burdensome to the People.</p>

There came out to him an ancient Woman, and with her, a lively brisk Lad about Twelve Years old. The Lad was so ruddy, and fair, that his Complection gave the Governour a Curiosity to ask some Questions concerning him; and to his great Surprize was told, That he was the Son of that Woman at 76 Years of Age. His Excellency, smiling at this Improbability, enquir'd what sort of Man had been his Father? To this the good Woman made no Reply, but instantly ran, and led her Husband to the Door, who was then above 100 Years old. He confirm'd all that the Woman had said about the Lad, and, notwithstanding his great Age, was strong in his Limbs, and Voice; but had lost his Sight. The Woman for her part was without Complaint, and seem'd to retain a Vigour very uncommon at her Years. Sir <hi rend="italics">Edmund</hi> was so well pleas'd with this extraordinary Account that, after having made himself known to them, he offer'd to take care of the Lad: But they would by no means be perswaded to part with him. However, he gave them 20 Pounds.</p>

In <hi rend="italics">November,</hi> 1698. <hi rend="italics">Francis Nicholson,</hi> Esq; was removed from <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> to be Governour of <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi> But he went not then with that Smoothness on his Brow, he had carry'd with him, when be was appointed Lieutenant-Governour. He talk'd then no more of improving of Manufactures, Towns, and Trade. Neither was he pleased to make the Acts of Assembly the Rule of his Judgments, as formerly: But his own All-sufficient Will and Pleasure. Instead of encouraging the Manufactures,
<pb n="98"/>
he sent over inhuman Memorials against them, which were so opposite to all Reason, that they refuted themselves. In one of these, he remonstrates, <hi rend="italics">That the Tobacco of that Country often bears so low a Price, that it will not yield Cloaths to the People that make it;</hi> and yet presently after, in the same Memorial, he recommends it to the Parliament, <hi rend="italics">to pass an Act, forbidding the Plantations to make their own Cloathing;</hi> which, in other Words, <hi rend="italics">is desiring a charitable Law, that the Planters shall go naked.</hi> In a late Memorial concerted between him and his Creature Col. <hi rend="italics">Quarrey,</hi> 'tis most humbly proposed, <hi rend="italics">That all the</hi> English <hi rend="italics">Colonies on the Continent of North</hi> America, <hi rend="italics">be reduced under one Government, and under one Vice-Roy; and that a standing Army be there kept on foot, to subdue the Queen's Enemies;</hi> which in plain <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> is imploring Her Majesty, to put the Plantations under Martial Law, and in the Consequence, to give the Vice-Roy a fair Opportunity of shaking off his Dependance upon <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>

                     <p>§. 146 He began his Government with a pompous Shew of Zeal for the Church; tho' his Practice was not of a Piece with his pious Pretensions. It must be confess'd, that he has bestow'd some Liberalities upon the Clergy: But always upon Condition, that they should proclaim his Charity, either by signing Addresses dictated by himself, in his own Commendation, or at least by writing Letters of it to the Bishops in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> And he wou'd ever be so careful to hinder these Representations from miscarrying, that he constantly took Copies of them, and sent 'em with his own Letters.</p>
                     <p>He likewise gave himself Airs of encouraging the College: But he used this Pretext for so many By-Ends, that at last the Promoters of that good Work, grew weary of the Mockery. They perceiv'd his View was to gain himself a Character, and if he cou'd but raise that, the College might sink. And in Truth he has been so far from advancing it, that now after the Six Years of his Government, the Scholars are fewer than at his Arrival.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 147. Soon after his Accession to the Government, he caused the Assembly, and Courts of Judicature, to be remov'd from <hi rend="italics">James Town,</hi> where there were good Accommodations for People, to <hi rend="italics">Middle-Plantation,</hi> where there were none. There he flatter'd himself with the
<pb n="99"/>
fond Imagination, of being the Founder of a new City. He mark'd out the Streets in many Places, so as that they might represent the Figure of a <hi rend="italics">W,</hi> in Memory of his late Majesty King <hi rend="italics">William,</hi> after whose Name the Town was call'd <hi rend="italics">Williamsburg.</hi> There he procur'd a stately Fabrick to be erected, which he placed opposite to the College, and graced it with the magnificent Name of the <hi rend="italics">Capitol.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This imaginary City is yet advanced no further, than only to have a few Publick Houses, and a Store-House, more than were built upon the Place before. And by the Frequency of Publick Meetings, and the Misfortune of his Residence, the Students are interrupted in their Study, and make less Advances than formerly.</p>
                     <p>To defray the Charge of building the <hi rend="italics">Capitol,</hi> he suggested the pernicious Duty of 15 Shillings for each Christian Servant imported, except <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and 20 Shillings for each Negro. I call this a pernicious Duty, because 'tis a great Hinderance to the Increase of that young Colony, as well as a very unequal Tax upon their Labour.</p>

                     <p>§ 148. It has been the constant Maxim of this Gentleman to set the People at Variance as much as possible amongst themselves. Whether this proceed from his great Fondness to the <hi rend="italics">Machevellian</hi> Principle, <hi rend="italics">Divide &amp; Impera,</hi> or from his exceeding good Nature, I won't pretend to determine. But 'tis very certain, that by his Management, he has divided the most friendly, and most united People in the World, into very unhappy Factions. And, what is still worse, he has been heard to declare publickly to the Populace, <hi rend="italics">That the Gentlemen imposed upon them, and that the Servants had been all kidnapp'd, and had a lawful Action against their Masters.</hi>

                     <p>And that these Things may make the more effectual Impression, he takes care to vilifie the Gentlemen of the Council in publick Places, by the grossest and most injurious Language. He is frequently pleased to send vexatious Commands, to summon People in Her Majesty's Name, to attend him at some general Meeting, and when they come, all the Business perhaps he has with them, is to affront them before all the Company.</p>

There 'tis usual with him to fall into excessive Passions, and utter the most abusive Language against those that presume to oppose his Arbitrary Proceedings. If the Attorney-General be so scrupulous, as to excuse himself from executing his illegal Commands, he runs a great Risque of being ill used. For in the Year 1700, Mr. <hi rend="italics">Fowler,</hi> who was then the King's Attorney, declining some hard Piece of Service, as being against Law, his Excellency in a Fury took him by the Collar, and swore, <hi rend="italics">That he knew of no Laws they had, and that his Commands should be obey'd without Hesitation or Reserve.</hi> He often commits Gentlemen to Gaol, without the least Shadow of Complaint against them, and that without Bail, or Mainprize, to the great Oppression of the Queen's loyal Subjects. Some of those have taken the Liberty to tell him, that such Proceedings were illegal, and not to be justify'd in any Country, that had the Happiness to be govern'd by the Laws of <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> To whom he has been heard to reply, <hi rend="italics">That they had no Right at all to the Liberties of</hi> English <hi rend="italics">Subjects, and that he wou'd hang up those that should presume to oppose him, with</hi> Magna Charta <hi rend="italics">about their Necks.</hi>

He often mentions the absolute Government of <hi rend="italics">Fess</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Morocco</hi> with great Pleasure, and extols the inhuman Cruelties of that Prince towards his Subjects. And particularly one Day at a Meeting of the Governours of the College; upon some Opposition they made against one of his violent Proceedings, he vouchsafed to to tell them, <hi rend="italics">That they were Dogs, and their Wives were Bitches; that he knew how to govern the</hi> Moors, <hi rend="italics">and would beat them into better Manners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither does this Gentleman treat the Assemblies with more Gentleness, than particular People; for he has said very publickly, <hi rend="italics">That he knew how to govern the Country without Assemblies; and if they should deny him any thing, after he had obtain'd a standing Army, he wou'd bring them to Reason, with Halters about their Necks.</hi>

                     <p>§. 151. But no Wonder that he deals so freely with the People there, since neither Her Majesty's Instructions, nor the Laws of that Country can restrain him. Thus he takes upon him to transact Matters of the greatest Moment, without Advice of the Council: As for Example, he has appointed several Officers, without their Advice, which he ought not to do. Sometimes
<pb n="101"/>
he has brought his Orders in his Hand, into the Council, and sign'd them at the Board, without so much as acquainting the Council what they were; tho' at the same time, they ought not to pass without their Advice; and after he had done this, he order'd the Clerk to enter them into the Minutes, as if they had been acted by the Consent of the Council.</p>
                     <p>If any of the Council happen to argue, or vote any thing contrary to this Gentleman's Inclinations, he instantly flies out into the most outragious Passions, and treats them with Terms very unbecoming his Station. By this means he takes away all Freedom of Debate, and makes the Council of no other Use, than to palliate his Arbitrary Practices. Sometimes, when he finds he can't carry Matters there as he desires, he makes no Scruple, of entring them in the Council-Books by his own Authority; he likewise causes many Things to be raz'd out, and others put in, by his own absolute Will and Pleasure. Nay, sometimes too, he has caused an Abstract of the Journals to be sent to <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> instead of the Journals themselves; by which Artifice he leaves out, or puts in, just as much as he thinks fit.</p>

He is very sensible how unwarrantable and unjust these Proceedings are, and therefore has been always jealous, left some of the many that have been injured, should send over their Complaints to <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> This has put him upon a Practice most destructive to all Trade and Correspondence, which is, the Intercepting, and Breaking open of Letters. His Method was, to give Directions to some of his Creatures, dwelling near the Mouths of the Rivers, to send on Board the several Ships, that happen'd to arrive, and in the Governour's Name, demand the Letters. Thus he used to get them, and open as many as he thought fit, after which sometimes he would cause 'em to be sent where they were directed, and sometimes keep them. By this Management many People have not only suffer'd the Loss of their Letters, and of their Accounts, Invoices, &amp;<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> but likewise have miss'd great Advantages, for want of timely Advice, occasion'd by the Stopping of their Letters.</p>

<pb n="102"/>
has condescended to act the low Part of an Eves-dropper himself, and to stand under a Window to listen for Secrets, that would certainly displease him. This Practice has made every Man afraid of his Neighbour, and destroy'd the mutual Confidence of the dearest Friends.</p>
                     <p>But the most extraordinary Method of learning Secrets, that ever was used in an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Government, was a kind of Inquisition, which this Gentleman has been pleased to erect frequently in that Country. He would call Courts at unusual Times, to enquire into the Life, and Conversation of those Persons, that had the Misfortune to be out of his Favour; tho' there was not the least publick Accusation against them. To these Courts he summon'd all the Neighbours of the Party he intended to expose, especially those that he knew were most intimate with him. Upon their Appearance, he administer'd an Oath to them, to answer truly, to all such Interrogatories, as he should propose. Then he would ask them endless Questions, concerning the particular Discourse and Behaviour of he Party, in order to find out something that might be the Ground of an Accusation.</p>

                     <p>§. 154. In the 2d Year of this Gentleman's Government, there happen'd an Adventure very fortunate for him, which gave him much Credit with those, who rely'd on his own Account of the Matter; and that was the Taking of a Pyrate within the Capes of that Country.</p>
                     <p>It fell out that several Merchant Ships were got ready, and fallen down to <hi rend="italics">Lynhaven</hi> Bay, near the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, in order for sailing. A Pyrate being inform'd of this, and hearing that there was no Man of War there, except a Sixth Rate, ventured within the Capes, and took several of the Merchant Ships. But a small Vessel happen'd to come down the Bay, and seeing an Engagement between the Pyrate, and a Merchant-man, made a Shift to get into the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, where the <hi rend="italics">Shoram,</hi> a Fifth Rate Man of War, was newly arriv'd. The Sixth Rate, commanded by Capt. <hi rend="italics">John Aldred,</hi> was then on the Carine in <hi rend="italics">Elizabeth</hi> River, in order for her Return to <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Governour happen'd to be at that Time at <hi rend="italics">Kiquotan,</hi> sealing up his Letters, and Capt. <hi rend="italics">Passenger,</hi> Commander of the <hi rend="italics">Shoram,</hi> went ashoar, to pay his Respects to him. In the mean while News was brought, that a Pyrate was got within the Capes; upon which the Captain was in Haste to go aboard his Ship: But the Governour would have stay'd him, promising to go along with him. The Captain soon after ask'd his Excuse, and went off, leaving him another Boat, if he pleased to follow. It was about One a Clock in the Afternoon, when the News was brought; but 'twas within Night, before his Excellency went aboard, staying all that while ashoar, upon some weighty Pretences. However, at last he follow'd, and by Break of Day, the Man of War was fairly out between the Capes, and the Pyrate;
<pb n="103"/>
where after Ten Hours sharp Engagement, the Pyrate was obliged to strike, and surrender, upon the Terms of being left to the King's Mercy.</p>
                     <p>Now it happen'd, that Three Men of this Pyrate's Gang, were not on Board their own Ship at the time of the Surrender, and so were not included in the Articles of Capitulation, but were try'd in that Country. In summing up the Charge against them, (the Governour being present) the Attorney-General extoll'd his Excellency's mighty Courage, and Conduct, as if the Honour of taking the Pyrate had been due to him. Upon this, Capt. <hi rend="italics">Passenger</hi> took the Freedom to interrupt Mr. Attorney in open Court, and said, that he was Commander of the <hi rend="italics">Shoram;</hi> that the Pyrates were his Prisoners; and that no Body had pretended to command in that Engagement but himself: He further desir'd, that the Governour would do him the Justice to confess, whether he had given the least Word of Command all that Day, or directed any one thing during the whole Fight. Upon this, his Excellency tamely acknowledged, that what the Captain said was true; and so fairly yielded him all the Honour of that Exploit.</p>

                     <p>He had zealously recommended to the Court of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> the Necessity that <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> shou'd contribute a certain <hi rend="italics">Quota</hi> of Men, or else a Sum of Money, towards the Building, and Maintaining a Fort at <hi rend="italics">New-York.</hi> The Reason he gave for this, was, because <hi rend="italics">New-York</hi> was their Barrier, and as such it was but Justice, they shou'd help to defend it. This was by Order of his late Majesty K. <hi rend="italics">William</hi> proposed to the Assembly: But upon the most solid Reasons, they humbly remonstrated, <hi rend="italics">That neither the Forts then in being, nor any other that might be built in the Province of</hi> New-York, <hi rend="italics">cou'd in the least avail to the Defence and Security of</hi> Virginia, <hi rend="italics">for that either the</hi> French, <hi rend="italics">or the</hi> Indians <hi rend="italics">might invade that Colony, and not come within an Hundred Miles of any such Fort.</hi> The Truth of these Objections is obvious to any one, that ever look'd on the Maps of that Part of the World. But the Secret of the whole Business in plain Terms was this; Those Forts were necessary for <hi rend="italics">New York,</hi> to enable that Province to engross the Trade of the Neighbour <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> which being highly to the Disadvantage of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> 'twas unreasonable, that Country shou'd pay a Tribute towards its own Ruine. And since <hi rend="italics">New York</hi> wou'd reap all the Benefit of such Forts, 'twas but just, it shou'd bear all the Charge of building them.</p>
                     <p>Now the Glory Col. <hi rend="italics">Nicholson</hi> got in that Affair, was this; after he had represented <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> as Republican, and Rebellious, for not complying with his Proposal, he said publickly, That <hi rend="italics">New-York</hi> should not want the 900 Pounds, tho' he paid it out of his own Pocket, and soon after took a Journey to that Province.</p>
                     <pb n="104"/>
                     <p>When he arrived there, he gave his own Bills of Exchange for 900 Pounds, to the aforesaid use, boasting, that he only rely'd on Her Majesty's Goodness to reimburse him out of the Quit-Rents of <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi> But this was nothing but Grimace; for at the same time that he pass'd the Bills, he prudently took a Defeasance from the Gentleman, to whom they were given, specifying, <hi rend="italics">That till Her Majesty shou'd be graciously pleased, to remit him the Money out of the Quit Rents, those Bills shou'd never be made use of.</hi> This was an admirable Piece of Sham-Generosity, and worthy of the great Pains he took to proclaim it. I my self have frequently heard him boast, that he gave this Money out of his own Pocket, and only depended on the Queen's Bounty to repay him.</p>
                     <p>Neither was he contented to spread abroad this untruth there; but he also foisted it into a Memorial of Col. <hi rend="italics">Quarry</hi>'s to the Council of Trade, in which are these Words: <hi rend="italics">As soon as Governour</hi> Nicholson <hi rend="italics">found the Assembly of</hi> Virginia <hi rend="italics">wou'd not see their own interest, nor comply with Her Majesty's Orders, be went immediately to</hi> New York; <hi rend="italics">and out of his great Zeal to the Queen's Service, and the Security of Her Province, he gave his own Bills for</hi> 900 <hi rend="italics">Pounds, to answer the</hi> Quota <hi rend="italics">of</hi> Virginia, <hi rend="italics">wholly depending on Her Majesty's Favour, to reimburse him out of the Revenues in that Province.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certainly his Excellency, and Col. <hi rend="italics">Quarry,</hi> by whose joint Wisdom and Sincerity this Memorial was composed, must believe, that the <hi rend="italics">Council of Trade</hi> have very imperfect Intelligence, how Matters pass in that Part of the World, or else they would not presume to impose such a Banter upon them.</p>
                     <p>But this is nothing, if compar'd to some other Passages of that unjust Representation, wherein they take upon them to describe the People of <hi rend="italics">Virginia, to be both numerous and rich, of Republican Notions and Principles, such as ought to be corrected, and lower'd in time; and that now or never is the only Time to maintain the Queen's Prerogative, and put a Stop to those wrong pernicious Notions, which are improving daily, not only in</hi> Virginia, <hi rend="italics">but in all Her Majesty's other Governments. A Frown now from Her Majesty, will do more than an Army hereafter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With those inhuman Reflections do those Gentlemen afterwards introduce the Necessity of a standing Army, the Truth of which is equal to that of the precedent Paragraph. Thus are that loyal People privately, and basely misrepresented; because they struggle against the Oppression, which this Governour practices, in Contempt of Her Majesty's Instructions, and the Laws of the Country. But I challenge the Authors of that Memorial, to give one single Instance, wherein the Inhabitants of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> have shown the least Want of Loyalty to the Queen, or the least Disaffection to <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>

were made, by particular Names, those Names for a long time served only to distinguish them, as so many Parts of <hi rend="italics">Virginia:</hi> And until the Plantations became more familiar to <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> it was so continued. But in Process of Time, the Name of <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> was lost to all, except to that Tract of Land lying along the Bay of <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak,</hi> and a little to the Southward, in which are included <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland;</hi> both which, in common Discourse, are still very often meant by the Name of <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi>

The Entrance into <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> for Shipping, is by the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak</hi> Bay, which is indeed more like a River, than a Bay: For it runs up into the Land about Two Hundred Miles, being every where near as wide, as it is at the Mouth, and in many Places much wider. The Mouth thereof is about Seven Leagues over, through which all Ships must pass to go to <hi rend="italics">Maryland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Coast is a bold and even Coast, with regular Soundings, and is open all the Year round: So that having the Latitude, which also can hardly be wanted, upon a Coast where so much clear Weather is, any Ship may go in by Soundings alone, by Day or Night, in Summer or in Winter; and need not fear any Disaster, if the Mariners
<pb n="3"/>
understand any thing; for, let the Wind blow how it will, and chop about as suddenly as it pleases, any Master, tho' his Ship be never so dull, has Opportunity (by the Evenness of the Coast) either of standing off, and clearing the Shore; or else of running into safe Harbour within the Capes. A bolder and safer Coast is not known in the universe; to which Conveniencies, there's the Addition of good Anchorage all along upon it, without the Capes.</p>

                     <p>§. 4. THE Largeness of the Bay of <hi rend="italics">Chesapeak</hi> I have mention'd already. From one End of it to the other, there's good Anchorage, and so little Danger of a Wreck, that many Masters, who have never been there before, venture up to the Head of the Bay, upon the slender Knowledge of a common Sailor. But the Experience of one Voyage teaches any Master to go up afterwards, without a Pilot.</p>
                     <p>Besides this Bay, the Country is water'd with Four great Rivers, <hi rend="italics">viz. James, York, Rappahannock,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Patowmeck</hi> Rivers; all which are full of convenient and safe Harbours. There are also abundance of lesser Rivers, many of which are capable of receiving the biggest Merchant-Ships, <hi rend="italics">viz. Elizabeth</hi> River, <hi rend="italics">Nansamond, Chickahomony, Pocoson, Pamunky, Mattapony,</hi> (which Two last are the Two upper Branches of <hi rend="italics">York</hi> River) <hi rend="italics">North</hi> River, <hi rend="italics">Eastermost</hi> River, <hi rend="italics">Corotoman, Wiccocomoco, Pocomoke, Chissenessick, Pungotegue,</hi> and many others: But because they are so well describ'd in the large Maps of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> I shall forbear any farther Description of them.</p>
                     <p>These Rivers are of such Convenience, that, for almost every Half Dozen Miles of their Extent, there's a commodious and safe Road for a whole Fleet; which gives Opportunity to the Masters of Ships, to lie up and down straggling, according as they have made their Acquaintance, riding before that Gentleman's Door where they find the best Reception, or where 'tis most suitable to their Business.</p>

These Rivers are made up, by the Conflux of an infinite Number of Chrystal Springs of cool and pleasant Water, issuing every-where out of the Banks, and Sides of the Valleys. These Springs flow so plentifully, that they make the River Water fresh Fifty, Threescore, and sometimes an Hundred Miles below the Flux and Reflux of the Tides; And sometime within 30, or 40 Miles of the Bay it self. The Conveniencies of these Springs are so many, they are not to be number'd: I shall therefore content my self to mention that one of supplying the Country every-where, except in the low Lands, with as many Mills as they can find Work for: And some of these send forth such a Glut a Water, that in less than Half a Mile below the Fountain-head, they afford a Stream sufficient to supply a Grist-Mill; of which there are several Instances.</p>

                     <p>§. 6. The only Mischief I know belonging to these Rivers is, that in the Month of <hi rend="italics">June</hi> Annually, there rise up in the Salts, vast Beds of Seedling-Worms, which enter the Ships, Sloops, or Boats where-ever they find the Coat of Pitch, Tar, or Lime worn off the Timber; and by degrees eat the Plank into Cells like those of an Honey-comb. These Worms continue thus upon the Surface of the Water, from their Rise in <hi rend="italics">June,</hi> until the first great Rains, after the Middle of <hi rend="italics">July;</hi> but after that, do no other Damage till the next Summer-Season, and never penetrate farther than the Plank or Timber they first fix upon.</p>
                     <p>The Damage occasion'd by these Worms, may be Four several Ways avoided.</p>
                     <p>1. By keeping the Coat, (of Pitch, Lime and Tallow, or whatever else it is,) whole upon the Bottom of the Ship or Vessel, for these Worms,
<pb n="6"/>
never fasten nor enter, but where the Timber is naked.</p>
                     <p>2. By Anchoring the larger Vessels in the Strength of the Tide, during the Worm-Season, and haling the Smaller ashore, for in the Currant of a strong Tide, the Worm cannot fasten.</p>
                     <p>3. By Burning and Cleaning immediately after the Worm-Season is over, for then they are but just stuck into the Plank, and have not buried themselves in it; so that the least Fire in the World destroys them entirely, and prevents all Damage, that would otherwise ensue from them.</p>
                     <p>4. By running up into the Freshes with the Ship or Vessel during the Five or Six Weeks, that the Worm is thus above Water: For they never bite, nor do any Damage in fresh Water, or where it is not very salt.</p>

                     <p>§. 7. THE Soil is of such Variety, according to the Difference of Situation, that one Part or other of it, seems fitted to every sort of Plant, that is requisite either for the Benefit or Pleasure of Mankind. And, were it not for the high Mountains to the North-West, which are supposed to retain vast Magazines of Snow, and by that means cause the Wind from that Quarter to descend a little too cold upon them, 'tis believed, that many of those delicious Summer Fruits, growing in the hotter Climates, might be kept there green all the Winter, without the Charge of Housing, or any other Care, than what is due to the natural Plants of the Country, when transplanted into a Garden. But,
<pb n="7"/>
as that would be no considerable Charge, any Man that is curious might, with all the Ease imaginable, preserve as many of them as would gratifie a moderate Luxury; and the Summer affords genial Heat enough, to ripen them to Perfection.</p>
                     <p>There are Three different kinds of Land, according to the Difference of Situation, either in the lower Parts of the Country, the Middle, or that on the Heads of the Rivers.</p>
                     <p>1. The Land towards the Mouth of the Rivers is generally of a low, moist and fat Mould, such as the heavier sort of Grain delight in, as Rice, Hemp, <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> This also is varied here and there with Veins of a cold, hungry, sandy Soil, of the same Moisture, and very often lying under Water. But this also has its Advantages; for on such Land, generally grow the Huckle-berries, Cran-berries, Chincapins, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> These low Lands are for the most part, well stor'd with Oaks, Poplars, Pines, Cedars, Cypress, and Sweet-Gums; the Trunks of which are often Thirty, Forty, Fifty, some Sixty or Seventy Foot high, without a Branch or Limb. They likewise produce great Variety of Evergreens, unknown to me by Name, besides the beauteous Holly, Sweet-Myrtle, Cedar, and the Live Oak, which for Three Quarters of the Year is continually dropping its Acorns, and at the same time budding, and bearing others in their Stead.</p>
                     <p>2. The Land higher up the Rivers throughout the whole Country, is generally a level Ground, with shallow Vallies, full of Streams and pleasant Springs of clear Water, having interspers'd here and there among the large Levels, some small Hills, and extensive Vales. The Mould in some Places is black, fat, and thick laid; in others looser, lighter, and thin. The Foundation of the Mould is also various; sometimes Clay, then Gravel, and Rocky Stones; and
<pb n="8"/>
sometimes Marle. The Middle of the Necks, or Ridges between the Rivers, is generally poor, being either a light Sand, or a white or red Clay, with a thin Mould: Yet even these Places are stored with Chesnuts, Chinkapins, Acorns of the Shrub-Oak, and a Reedy Grass in Summer, very good for Cattle. The rich Lands lie next the Rivers and Branches, and are stored with large Oaks, Walnuts, Hickories, Ash, Beech, Poplar, and many other Sorts of Timber, of surprizing Bigness.</p>
                     <p>3. The Heads of the Rivers afford a Mixture of Hills, Vallies and Plains, some richer than other, whereof the Fruits and Timber-Trees are also various. In some Places lie great Plats of low and very rich Ground, well Timber'd; in others, large Spots of Meadows and Savanna's, wherein are Hundreds of Acres without any Tree at all; but yield Reeds and Grass of incredible Height: And in the Swamps and sunken Grounds grow Trees, as vastly big, as I believe the World affords, and stand so close together, that the Branches or Boughs of many of them, lock into one another; but what lessens their Value is, that the greatest Bulk of them are at some Distance from Water-Carriage. The Land of these upper Parts affords greater Variety of Soil, than any other, and as great Variety in the Foundations of the Soil or Mould, of which good Judgment may be made, by the Plants and Herbs that grow upon it. The Rivers and Creeks do in many Places form very fine large Marshes, which are a convenient Support for their Flocks and Herds.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 8. There is likewise found great Variety of Earths for Physick, Cleansing, Scouring, and making all Sorts of Potters-Ware; such as Antimony, Talk, yellow and red Oker, Fullers-Earth, Pipe-Clay,
<pb n="9"/>
and other fat and fine Clays, Marle, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> In a Word, there are all kinds of Earth fit for Use.</p>
                     <p>They have besides in those upper Parts, Coal for Firing, Slate for Covering, and Stones for Building, and Flat-Paving in vast Quantities, as likewise Pibble-Stones. Nevertheless, it has been confidently affirm'd by many, who have been there, that there is not a Stone in all the Country. If such Travellers knew no better than they said, my Judgment of them is, that either they were People of extream short Memories, or else of very narrow Observation. For tho' generally the lower Parts are flat, and so free from Stones, that People seldom Shoe their Horses; yet in many Places, and particularly near the Falls of the Rivers, are found vast Quantities of Stone, fit for all kind of Uses. However, as yet there is seldom any Use made of them, because commonly Wood is to be had at much less Trouble. And as for Coals, it is not likely they should ever be used there in any thing, but Forges and great Towns, if ever they happen to have any; for, in their Country Plantations, the Wood grows at every Man's Door so fast, that after it has been cut down, it will in Seven Years time, grow up again from Seed, to substantial Fire-Wood; and in Eighteen or Twenty Years 'twill come to be very good Board-Timber.</p>

                     <p>§. 9. For Mineral Earths, 'tis believ'd, they have great Plenty and Variety, that Country being in a good Latitude, and having great Appearances of them. It has been proved too, that they have both Iron and Lead, as appears by what was said before, concerning the Iron-Work, set up at <hi rend="italics">Falling-Creek,</hi> in <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, where the Iron proved reasonably good: But before they got into the Body of the Mine, the People were cut off in that fatal Massacre; and the Project has never been set on
<pb n="10"/>
Foot since. However, Col. <hi rend="italics">Byrd,</hi> who is Proprietor of that Land, is at this Time boring, and searching after the richest Veins, near the Place of the former Work; which is very commodious for such an Undertaking, by reason of the Neighbourhood of abundance of Wood, running Water, Fire-Stone, and other Necessaries for that Purpose.</p>
                     <p>It is also said, that there is found good Iron Ore at <hi rend="italics">Corotoman,</hi> and in several other Parts of the Country.</p>
                     <p>The Gold-Mine, of which there was lately so much Noise, may, perhaps, be found hereafter to be some good Metal, when it comes to be fully examined. But, be that as it will, the Stones, that are found near it in great Plenty, are valuable; their Lustre approaching nearer to that of the Diamond, than those of <hi rend="italics">Bristol</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Kerry.</hi> There is no other Fault in them, but their Softness, which the Weather hardens, when they have been some time exposed to it, they being found under the Surface of the Earth. This Place is about a Day's Journey from the Frontier Inhabitants of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be the Place in <hi rend="italics">Purchase</hi>'s Fourth Book of Pilgrimage, called <hi rend="italics">Uttamussack,</hi> where was formerly the principal Temple of the Country, and the Metropolitan Seat of the Priests, in <hi rend="italics">Powhatan</hi>'s Time. There stood the Three great Houses, near Sixty Foot in Length, which he reports to have been fill'd with the Images of their Gods; there were likewise preserved the Bodies of their Kings. These Houses they counted so holy, that none but their Priests and Kings durst go into them, the common People not presuming, without their particular Direction, to approach the Place.</p>
                     <p>There also was their great <hi rend="italics">Pawcorance,</hi> or Altar-Stone, which, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> tell us, was a solid Chrystal, of between Three and Four Foot Cube, upon which,
<pb n="11"/>
in their greatest Solemnities, they used to sacrifice. This, they would make us believe, was so clear, that the Grain of a Man's Skin might be seen through it; and was so heavy too, that when they remov'd their Gods and Kings, not being able to carry it away, they buried it thereabouts: But the Place has never been yet discover'd.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi rend="italics">Alexander Whittaker,</hi> Minister of <hi rend="italics">Henrico,</hi> on <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, in the Company's Time, writing to them, says thus: <hi rend="italics">Twelve Miles from the Falls, there is a Chrystal Rock, wherewith the</hi> Indians <hi rend="italics">do head many of their Arrows; and Three Days Journey from thence, there is a Rock and Stony Hill found, which is on the Top covered over with a perfect and most rich Silver Ore. Our Men that went to discover those Parts, had but Two Iron Pickaxes with them, and those so ill temper'd, that the Points of them turn'd again, and bow'd at every Stroke; so that we could not search the Entrails of the Place: Yet some Trial was made of that Ore with good Success.</hi>

                     <p>§. 10. Some People that have been in that Country, without knowing any thing about it, have affirm'd, that it is all a Flat, without any Mixture of Hills, because they see the Coast to Seaward perfectly level: Or else they have made their Judgment of the whole Country, by the Lands lying on the lower Parts of the Rivers (which, perhaps, they had never been beyond) and so conclude it to be throughout plain and even. When in truth, upon the Heads of the great Rivers, there are vast high Hills; and even among the Settlements, there are some so topping, that I have stood upon them, and view'd the Country all around over the Tops of the highest Trees, for many Leagues together; particularly, there are <hi rend="italics">Mawborn</hi> Hills in the Freshes of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River; a Ridge of Hills about
<pb n="12"/>
Fourteen or Fifteen Miles up <hi rend="italics">Mattapony</hi> River; <hi rend="italics">Tolivers</hi> Mount, upon <hi rend="italics">Rappahannock</hi> River; and the Ridge of Hills in <hi rend="italics">Stafford</hi> County, in the Freshes of <hi rend="italics">Patowmeck</hi> River; all which are within the Bounds of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Inhabitants. But a little farther backward, there are Mountains, which indeed deserve the Name of Mountains, for their Height and Bigness. But since I have not seen them my self, I shall not pretend to give an Account of them, but refer you to <hi rend="italics">Batt</hi>'s Report, <hi rend="italics">Pag.</hi> 64. of the First Book.</p>
                     <p>These Hills are not without their Advantages; for, out of almost every rising Ground, throughout the Country, there issue Abundance of most pleasant Streams, of Pure and Chrystal Water, than which certainly the World does not afford any more delicious. These are every-where to be found in the upper Parts of this Country; and many of them flow out of the Sides of Banks very high above the Vales, which are the most suitable Places for Gardens: Where the finest Water-works in the World may be made, at a very small Expence.</p>
                     <p>There are likewise several Mineral Springs, easily discoverable by their Taste, as well as by the Soil, which they drive out with their Streams. But I am not Naturalist skilful enough, to describe them with the Exactness they deserve.</p>

Of Fruits natural to the Country there is great Abundance, but the several Species of them, are produced according to the Difference of the Soil, and the various Situation of the Country: It being impossible that one Piece of Ground, should produce so many different Kinds intermix'd. Of the better Sorts of the wild Fruits, that I have met with, I will barely give you the Names, not designing a Natural History. And when I have done that, possibly I may not mention one half of what the Country affords, because I never went out of my Way, to enquire after any Thing of this Nature.</p>

                     <p>§. 12. Of stoned Fruits, I have met with Three good Sorts, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> Cherries, Plums, and Persimmons.</p>
                     <p>1. Of Cherries natural to the Country, and growing wild in the Woods, I have seen Three Sorts. Two of these grow upon Trees, as big as the common <hi rend="italics">English</hi> white Oak, whereof one grows in Bunches like Grapes. Both these Sorts are black without, and but one of them red within; that which is red within, is more palatable than the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> black Cherry, as being without its bitterness. The Other, which hangs on the Branch like Grapes, is Water-colour'd within, of a faintish Sweet, and greedily devour'd by the small Birds. The Third sort is call'd the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Cherry, and grows higher up in the Country, than the Others do. It is commonly
<pb n="14"/>
found by the Sides of Rivers, and Branches, on small slender Trees, scarce able to support themselves, about the Bigness of the Peach-Trees in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> This is certainly the most delicious Cherry in the World; it is of a dark Purple when ripe, and grows upon a single Stalk, like the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Cherry, but is very small; though, I suppose, it may be made larger by Cultivation, if any Body wou'd mind it. These too are so greedily devour'd by the small Birds, that they won't let them remain on the Tree, long enough to ripen; by which Means, they are rarely known to any, and much more rarely tasted; though perhaps at the same time, they grow just by the Houses.</p>
                     <p>2. The Plums which I have observ'd to grow wild there, are of Two sorts, the Black, and the Murrey Plum, both which are small, and have much the same Relish with the Damasine.</p>
                     <p>3. The Persimmon is by <hi rend="italics">Hariot</hi> call'd the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Plum; and so <hi rend="italics">Smith, Purchase,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Du Lake,</hi> call it after him; but I can't perceive that any of those Authors, had ever heard of the Sorts I have just now mention'd, they growing high up in the Country. These Persimmons amongst them retain their <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Name. They are of several Sizes, between the Bigness of a Damasine and a Burgamot Pear. The Taste of them is so very rough, it is not to be endured, till they are fully ripe, and then they are a pleasant Fruit. Of these some <hi rend="italics">Vertuosi</hi> make an agreeable kind of Beer; to which Purpose they dry them in Cakes, and lay them up for Use. These, like most other Fruits there, grow as thick upon the Trees, as Ropes of Onions; the Branches very often break down by the mighty Weight of the Fruit.</p>
                     <pb n="15"/>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 13. Of Berries there is a great Variety, and all very good in their Kinds. Our Mulberries are of Three sorts, two Black and one White; the long Black sort are the best, being about the Bigness of a Boy's Thumb; the other Two sorts are of the Shape of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Mulberry, short and thick, but their Taste does not so generally please, being of a faintish Sweet, without any Tartness. They grow upon well spread, large bodied Trees, which run up surprizingly fast. These are the proper Food of the Silk-Worm.</p>
                     <p>2. There grow naturally Two Sorts of Currants, one red, and the other black, far more pleasant than those of the same Colour in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> They grow upon small Bushes.</p>
                     <p>3. There are Three Sorts of Hurts, or Huckleberries, upon Bushes, Two to Ten Foot high. They grow in the Vallies and sunken Grounds, having different Relishes; but are all pleasing to the Taste. The largest sort grow upon the largest Bushes, and, I think, are the best Berries.</p>
                     <p>4. Cranberries grow in the low Lands, and barren sunken Grounds, upon low Bushes, like the Gooseberry, and are much of the same Size. They are of a lively Red, when ripe, and make very good Tarts. I believe, these are the Berries, which Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> compared to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Gooseberry, and called <hi rend="italics">Rawcomens;</hi> having, perhaps, seen some of them green, but none ripe.</p>
                     <p>5. The wild Rasberry is by some there, preferr'd to those, that were transplanted thither from <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> but I cannot be of their Opinion.</p>
                     <p>6. Strawberries they have, as delicious as any in the World, and growing almost every where in the Woods, and Fields. They are eaten almost by all Creatures; and yet are so plentiful, that very few Persons take care to transplant them, but can find
<pb n="16"/>
enough to fill their Baskets, when they have a mind, in the deserted old Fields.</p>

                     <p>§. 14. There grow wild several Sorts of good Nuts, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> Chesnuts, Chinkapins, Hasel-nuts, Hickories, Walnuts, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Chesnuts are found upon very high Trees, growing in barren Ridges. They are something less than the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Chesnut; but, I think, not differing at all in Taste.</p>
                     <p>2. Chinkapins have a Taste something like a Chesnut, and grow in a Husk or Bur, being of the same sort of Substance, but not so big as an Acorn. They grow upon large Bushes, about as high as the common Apple-Trees in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and either in the high or low, but always barren Ground.</p>
                     <p>3. Hasel-nuts are there in infinite Plenty, in all the Swamps; and towards the Heads of the Rivers, whole Acres of them are found upon the high Land.</p>
                     <p>4. Hickory-nuts are of several Sorts, all growing upon great Trees, and in an Husk, like the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Walnut, except that the Husk is not so thick, and more apt to open. Some of these Nuts are inclosed in so hard a Shell, that a light Hammer will hardly crack them; and when they are crack'd, their Kernel is fasten'd with so firm a Web, that there's no coming at it. Several other Sorts I have seen with thinner Shells, whose Kernel may be got with less Trouble. There are also several Sorts of Hickories, call'd Pig-nuts, some of which have as thin a Shell as the best <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Walnuts, and yield their Meat very easily.</p>
                     <p>5. They have a sort of Walnut they call, Black-Walnuts, which are as big again as any I ever saw in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> but are very rank and oily, having a thick, hard, foul Shell, and come not clear of the Husk, as the Walnut in <hi rend="italics">France</hi> doth.</p>
                     <pb n="17"/>
                     <p>6. Their Woods likewise afford a vast Variety of Acorns, Seven Sorts of which have fallen under my Observation. That which grows upon the Live Oak, buds, ripens, and drops off the Tree, almost the whole Year round. All their Acorns are very fat and oily; but the Live-Oak Acorn is much more so than the rest; and I believe the making Oil of them, would turn to a good Account: But now they only serve as Maste for the Hogs, and other wild Creatures, as do all the other Fruits aforemention'd; together with several other sorts of Maste growing upon the Beech, Pine, and other Trees. The same Use is made also of divers Sorts of Pulse, and other Fruits, growing upon wild Vines; such as Peas, Beans, Vetches, Squashes, Maycocks, Maracocks, Melons, Cucumbers, Lupines, and an Infinity of other Sorts of Fruits, which I cannot name.</p>

                     <p>§. 15. Grapes grow wild there in an incredible Plenty, and Variety; some of which are very sweet, and pleasant to the Taste, others rough and harsh, and, perhaps, fitter for Wine or Brandy. I have seen great Trees covered with single Vines, and those Vines almost hid with the Grapes. Of these wild Grapes, besides those large ones in the Mountains, mention'd by <hi rend="italics">Batt</hi> in his Discovery, I have observed Six very different Kinds, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Two of these Sorts grow among the Sandbanks, upon the Edges of the low Grounds, and Islands next the Bay, and Sea. They grow thin in small Bunches, and upon very low Vines. These are noble Grapes; and tho' they are wild in the Woods, are as large as the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> Gooseberry. One Species of them is white, the other purple, but both much alike in Flavour.</p>
                     <p>2. A Third Kind is produced throughout the whole Country, in the Swamps and Sides of Hills.

These also grow upon small Vines, and in small Bunches; but are themselves as big as the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Bullace, and of a rank Taste when ripe, resembling the Smell of a Fox, from whence they are called Fox-Grapes. All these Three Sorts, when ripe, make admirable Tarts, being of a fleshy Substance, and, perhaps, if rightly managed, might make good Raisins.</p>
                     <p>3. There are Two Species more, that are common to the whole Country, some of which are black, and some blue on the Outside, but are both red within. They grow upon vast large Vines, and bear very plentifully. The nice Observer might, perhaps, distinguish them into several Kinds, because they differ in Colour, Size, and Relish; but I shall divide them only into Two, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> The early, and the late ripe. The early ripe common Grape is much larger, sweeter and better than the other. Of these some are quite black, and others blue; some also ripen Three Weeks, or a Month before the other. The Distance of their Ripening, is from the latter End of <hi rend="italics">August,</hi> to the latter End of <hi rend="italics">October.</hi> The late ripe common Grapes are less than any of the other, neither are they so pleasant to the Taste. They hang commonly till the latter End of <hi rend="italics">November,</hi> or till <hi rend="italics">Christmas.</hi> Of the former of these Two Sorts, the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Refugees at the <hi rend="italics">Monacan</hi> Town have lately made a sort of Clarret, tho' they were gather'd off of the wild Vines in the Woods. I was told by a very good Judge, who tasted it, that it was a pleasant, strong, and full body'd Wine. From which we may conclude, that if the Wine was but tolerably good, when made of the wild Grape, which is shaded by the Woods, from the Sun, it would be much better, if produc'd of the same Grape cultivated in a regular Vineyard.</p>
                     <pb n="19"/>
                     <p>But here I find an Objection thrown in my Way, that Vineyards have been attempted both in <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> and that several <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Men went over to <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> on purpose to make Wine; and yet they could not succeed in it, but miscarried in all their Attempts. This I readily own: But I'll tell you what Progress they made, and why at last it came to nothing.</p>
                     <p>The Pine-Tree and Firare naturally very noxious to the Vine; and the Vine is observed never to thrive, where it is any ways influenced by them. Now, all the lower Parts of their Rivers naturally produce these Trees; insomuch, that if a Man clear the Land there, of the Wood, he will certainly find that the Pine is the first Tree that will grow up again, tho' perhaps there was not a Pine in that Spot of Ground before. Again; the Vine thrives best on the Sides of Hills, Gravelly Ground, and in the Neighbourhood of fresh Streams. But the Experiments that have been made of Vineyards, both in <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> have not only been near the malignant Influence of the Salt-Water, but also upon the low Lands, that are naturally subject to the Pine. The Experiment that Mr. <hi rend="italics">Isaac Jamart,</hi> a <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Merchant, made below <hi rend="italics">Archers-Hope-Creek,</hi> on <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> was attended with these Disadvantages. And so was that of Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley,</hi> tho' his Project had a further bad Circumstance: For, to save Labour, he planted Trees for the Vines to run upon. But as he was full of Projects, so he was always very fickle, and set them on Foot, only to shew us what might be done, and not out of Hopes of any Gain to himself; so never minded to bring them to Perfection.</p>
                     <p>With the same Inconveniencies, the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> went about their Vineyards. They planted them near the salt Rivers, in Piney Ground, and made use of low Land into the Bargain, they having
<pb n="20"/>
no other clear'd at that Time. Mr. <hi rend="italics">Nathaniel Johnson,</hi> the present Governour of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> has indeed of late made some likely Essays towards a Vineyard, having planted it upon the Hills: But he being now involv'd in Differences with the People, I am afraid that will be also neglected.</p>
                     <p>4. The Sixth Sort is far more palatable than the rest, and of the Size of the white Muscadine in <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> but these are peculiar to the Frontiers, on the Heads of the Rivers. They grow upon very small Vines, which climb not higher than the Shrub, or smallest Bushes, on which they generally rest, or on the Plants, which annually spring out of the Ground: But these are so greedily eaten by the small Birds, and other wild Creatures, to whom they hang convenient, by the Lowness of their Vine, that (as it was said of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Cherry) it is a great Rarity to find any of them ripe; though they are in great Plenty to be met with, while they are green. These, in all Likelihood, would make admirable Wine; unless the Earliness of their Ripening, may be an Objection.</p>
                     <p>The Year before the Massacre, <hi rend="italics">Anno</hi> 1622, which destroy'd so many good Projects for <hi rend="italics">Virginia;</hi> some <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Vignerons were sent thither, to make an Experiment of their Vines. These People were so in Love with the Country, that the Character they then gave of it, in their Letters to the Company in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> was very much to its Advantage; namely, That it far excell'd their own Country of <hi rend="italics">Languedoc:</hi> The Vines growing in great abundance and Variety all over the Land: That some of the Grapes were of that unusual Bigness, that they did not believe them to be Grapes, until by opening them, they had seen their Kernels: That they had planted the Cuttings of their Vines at <hi rend="italics">Michaelmas,</hi> and had Grapes from those very Cuttings, the Spring following. Adding in the Conclusion, That they had
<pb n="21"/>
not heard of the like in any other Country: Neither was this out of the Way; for I have made the same Experiment both of their natural Vine, and of the Plants sent thither from <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Copies of the Letters here quoted to the Company in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> are still to be seen; and <hi rend="italics">Purchase</hi> in his 4th Volume of Pilgrims, has very justly quoted some of them.</p>

                     <p>§. 16. The Honey and Sugar-Trees are likewise spontaneous, near the Heads of the Rivers. The Honey-Tree bears a thick swelling Pod, full of Honey, appearing at a Distance like the bending Pod of a Bean or Pea. The Sugar-Tree yields a kind of Sap or Juice, which by boiling is made into Sugar. This Juice is drawn out, by wounding the Trunk of the Tree, and placing a Receiver under the Wound. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> make One Pound of Sugar, out of Eight Pounds of the Liquor. Some of this Sugar I examined very carefully. It was bright and moist, with a large full Grain; the Sweetness of it being like that of good Muscovada.</p>
                     <p>Though this Discovery has not been made by the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> above Twelve or Fourteen Years; yet it has been known among the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> longer than any now living can remember. It was found out by the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> after this manner. The Soldiers which were kept on the Land Frontiers, to clear them of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> taking their Range through a Piece of low Ground, about Forty Miles above the inhabited Parts of <hi rend="italics">Patowmeck</hi> River, and resting themselves in the Woods of those low Grounds, observ'd an inspissate Juice, like Molasses, distilling from the Tree. The Heat of the Sun had candied some of this Juice, which gave the Men a Curiosity to taste it. They found it sweet, and by this Process of Nature, learn'd to improve it into Sugar. But these Trees growing so far above the Christian
<pb n="22"/>
Inhabitants, it hath not yet been tried, whether for Quantity, or Quality it may be worth while to cultivate this Discovery.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi rend="italics">Canada Indians</hi> make Sugar of the Sap of a Tree. And <hi rend="italics">Peter Martyr</hi> mentions a Tree that yields the like Sap, but without any Description. The <hi rend="italics">Eleomeli</hi> of the Ancients, a sweet Juice like Honey, is said to be got by wounding the Olive-Tree: And the <hi rend="italics">East-Indians</hi> extract a sort of Sugar, they call <hi rend="italics">Jagra,</hi> from the Juice, or potable Liquor, that flows from the Coco-Tree: The whole Process of Boiling, Graining and Refining of which, is accurately set down by the Authors of <hi rend="italics">Hortus Malabaricus.</hi>

                     <p>§. 17. At the Mouth of their Rivers, and all along upon the Sea and Bay, and near many of their Creeks and Swamps, grows the Myrtle, bearing a Berry, of which they make a hard brittle Wax, of a curious green Colour, which by refining becomes almost transparent. Of this they make Candles, which are never greasie to the Touch, nor melt with lying in the hottest Weather: Neither does the Snuff of these ever offend the Smell, like that of a Tallow-Candle; but, instead of being disagreeable, if an Accident puts a Candle out, it yields a pleasant Fragrancy to all that are in the Room; insomuch, that nice People often put them out, on purpose to have the Incense of the expiring Snuff.</p>
                     <p>The Melting of these Berries, is said to have been first found out by a Surgeon in <hi rend="italics">New-England,</hi> who perform'd wonderful Things, with a Salve made of them. This Discovery is very modern, notwithstanding these Countries have been so long settled.</p>
                     <p>The Method of managing these Berries, is by boiling them in Water, till they come to be intirely dissolv'd, except the Stone, or Seed, in the
<pb n="23"/>
Middle, which amounts in Quantity to about half the Bulk of the Berry; the Biggest of which is something less than a Corn of Pepper.</p>
                     <p>The Cedar-Berries also have been experienced, to yield the same sort of Wax as the Myrtle, their Berries being as much larger than Pepper, as those of the Myrtle are less.</p>
                     <p>There are also in the Planes, and rich Grounds of the Freshes, abundance of Hops, which yield their Product without any Labour of the Husbandman, in Weeding, Hilling, or Poling.</p>

                     <p>§. 18. All over the Country, is interspers'd here and there, a surprizing Variety of curious Plants and Flowers. They have a sort of Brier, growing something like the Sarsaparilla. The Berry of this is as big as a Pea, and as round, being of a bright Crimson Colour. It is very hard, and finely polish'd by Nature; so that it might be put to divers Ornamental Uses.</p>
                     <p>There are several Woods, Plants and Earths, which have been fit for the Dying of curious Colours. They have the Puccoon and Musquaspen, Two Roots, with which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> use to paint themselves red: There's the Shumack and the Sassafras, which make a deep Yellow. Mr <hi rend="italics">Heriot</hi> tells us of several others, which he found at <hi rend="italics">Pamtego,</hi> and gives the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Names of them: But that Language being not understood by the <hi rend="italics">Virginians,</hi> I am not able to distinguish which he means. Particularly he takes Notice of <hi rend="italics">Wasebur,</hi> an Herb; <hi rend="italics">Chapacour,</hi> a Root; and <hi rend="italics">Tangomockonominge,</hi> a Bark.</p>
                     <p>There's the Snake-Root, so much admired in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> for a Cordial, and for being a great Antidote in all Pestilential Distempers.</p>
                     <p>There's the Rattle-Snake-Root, to which no Remedy was ever yet found comparable; for it effectually cures the Bite of a Rattle-Snake, which
<pb n="24"/>
sometimes has been mortal in Two Minutes. If this Medicine be early applied, it presently removes the Infection, and in Two or Three Hours, restores the Patient to as perfect Health, as if he had never been hurt. This operates by violent Vomit, and Sweat.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">James-Town</hi> Weed (which resembles the Thorny Apple of <hi rend="italics">Peru,</hi> and I take to be the Plant so call'd) is supposed to be one of the greatest Coolers in the World. This being an early Plant, was gather'd very young for a boil'd Salad, by some of the Soldiers sent thither, to pacific the Troubles of <hi rend="italics">Bacon;</hi> and some of them eat plentifully of it, the Effect of which was a very pleasant Comedy; for they turn'd natural Fools upon it for several Days: One would blow up a Feather in the Air; another wou'd dart Straws at it with much Fury; and another stark naked was sitting up in a Corner, like a Monkey, grinning and making Mows at them; a Fourth would fondly kiss, and paw his Companions, and snear in their Faces, with a Countenance more antick, than any in a <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi> Droll. In this frantick Condition they were confined, lest they should in their Folly destroy themselves; though it was observed, that all their Actions were full of Innocence and good Nature. Indeed, they were not very cleanly; for they would have wallow'd in their own Excrements, if they had not been prevented. A Thousand such simple Tricks they play'd, and after Eleven Days, return'd to themselves again, not remembring any thing that had pass'd.</p>
                     <p>Of spontaneous Flowers they have an unknown Variety: The finest Crown Imperial in the World; the Cardinal-Flower, so much extoll'd for its Scarlet Colour, is almost in every Branch; the Moccasin Flower, and a Thousand others, not yet known, to <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Herbalists. Almost all the Year round,
<pb n="25"/>
the Levels and Vales are beautified with Flowers of one Kind or other, which make their Woods as fragrant as a Garden. From these Materials their wild Bees make vast Quantities of Honey, but their Magazines are very often rifled, by Bears, Raccoons, and such like liquorish Vermine.</p>
                     <p>About Two Years ago, walking out to take the Air, I found, a little without my Pasture Fence, a Flower as big as a Tulip, and upon a Stalk resembling the Stalk of a Tulip. The Flower was of a Flesh Colour, having a Down upon one End, while the other was plain. The Form of it resembled the <hi rend="italics">Pudenda</hi> of a Man and Woman lovingly join'd in one. Not long after I had discover'd this Rarity, and while it was still in Bloom, I drew a grave Gentleman, about an Hundred Yards, out of his Way, to see this Curiosity, not telling him any thing more, than that it was a Rarity, and such, perhaps, as he had never seen, nor heard of. When we arrived at the Place, I gather'd one of them, and put it into his Hand, which he had no sooner cast his Eye upon, but he threw it away with Indignation, as being asham'd of this Waggery of Nature. It was impossible to perswade him to touch it again, or so much as to squint towards so immodest a Representation. Neither would I presume to mention such an Indecency, but that I thought it unpardonable, to omit a Production so extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>There is also found, the fine Tulip-bearing Lawrel-Tree, which has the pleasantest Smell in the World, and keeps Blossoming and Seeding several Months together: It delights much in Gravelly Branches of Chrystal Streams, and perfumes the very Woods with its Odour. So also do the large Tulip-Tree, which we call a Poplar, the Locust, which resembles much the Jasmine, and the Perfuming Crab-Tree, during their Season. With one sort or other of these, as well as many other
<pb n="26"/>
Sweet-flowering Trees not named, the Woods are almost every-where adorn'd, and yield a surprizing Variety to divert the Traveller.</p>
                     <p>They find a World of Medicinal Plants likewise in that Country; and amongst the rest, the Planters pretend to have a Swamp-Root, which infallibly cures all Fevers, and Agues. The Bark of the Sassafras-Tree has been experimented to partake very much of the Virtue of the <hi rend="italics">Cortex Peruviana.</hi> The Bark of the Root, of that which we call the Prickly Ash, being dried and powder'd, has been found to be a Specifick, in old Ulcers, and Long-running Sores. Infinite is the Number of other valuable Vegetables of every Kind: But Natural History not having been much my Study, I am unwilling to do Wrong to my Subject, by an unskilful Description.</p>

                     <p>§. 19. Several Kinds of the Creeping Vines bearing Fruit, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> planted in their Gardens or Fields, because they wou'd have Plenty of them always at hand; such as, Musk-melons, Water-melons, Pompions, Cushaws, Macocks, and Gourds.</p>
                     <p>1. Their Musk-melons resemble the large <hi rend="italics">Italian</hi> Kind, and generally fill Four or Five Quarts.</p>
                     <p>2. Their Water-melons were much more large, and of several Kinds, distinguished by the Colour of their Meat and Seed; some are red, some yellow, and others white meated, and so of the Seed, some are yellow, some red, and some black; but these are never of different Colours in the same Melon. This Fruit the <hi rend="italics">Muscovites</hi> call <hi rend="italics">Arpus;</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Turks</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Tartars, Karpus,</hi> because they are extreamly cooling: The <hi rend="italics">Persians</hi> call them, <hi rend="italics">Hindnanes,</hi> because they had the first Seed of them from the <hi rend="italics">Indies.</hi> They are excellently good, and very pleasant to the Taste, as also to the Eye; having the
<pb n="27"/>
Rind of a lively green Colour, streak'd and water'd, the Meat of a Carnation, and the Seed black, and shinning, while it lies in the Melon.</p>
                     <p>3. Their Pompions I need not describe, but must say they are much larger and finer, than any I ever heard, of in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Their <hi rend="italics">Cushaws</hi> are a kind of Pompion, of a bluish green Colour, streaked with White, when they are sit for Use. They are larger than the Pompions, and have a long narrow Neck: Perhaps this may be the <hi rend="italics">Ecushaw</hi> of <hi rend="italics">T. Harriot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Their <hi rend="italics">Macocks</hi> are a sort of <hi rend="italics">Melopepones,</hi> or lesser sort of Pompion, of these they have great Variety, but the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Name <hi rend="italics">Macock</hi> serves for all, which Name is still retain'd among them. Yet the <hi rend="italics">Clypeatae</hi> are sometimes call'd <hi rend="italics">Cymnels</hi> (as are some others also) from the <hi rend="italics">Lenten</hi> Cake of that Name, which many of them very much resemble. <hi rend="italics">Squash,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Squanter-Squash,</hi> is their Name among the Northern <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and so they are call'd in <hi rend="italics">New-York,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">New-England.</hi> These being boil'd whole, when the Apple is young, and the Shell tender, and dished with Cream or Butter, relish very well with all sorts of Butcher's Meat, either fresh or salt. And whereas the Pompion is never eaten till it be ripe, these are never eaten after they are ripe.</p>
                     <p>6. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> never eat the Gourds, but plant them for other Uses. Yet the <hi rend="italics">Persians,</hi> who likewise abound with this sort of Fruit, eat the <hi rend="italics">Cucurbita Lagenaris,</hi> which they call <hi rend="italics">Kabach,</hi> boiling it while it is green, before it comes to it's full Maturity; For, when it is ripe, the Rind dries, and grows as hard as the Bark of a Tree, and the Meat within is so consumed, and dried away, that there is then nothing left but the Seed, which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> take clean out, and afterwards use the Shells instead of Flagons and Cups; as is done also in several other Parts of the World.</p>
                     <pb n="28"/>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Maracock,</hi> which is the Fruit of what we call the Passion Flower, our Natives did not take the Pains to plant, having enough of it growing every where; tho' they eat it with a great deal of Pleasure; this Fruit is about the Size of a Pullet's Egg.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 20. Besides all these, our Natives had originally amongst them, <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, Peas, Beans, Potatoes, and Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>This <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn was the Staff of Food, upon which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> did ever depend; for when Sickness, bad Weather, War, or any other ill Accident kept them from Hunting, Fishing and Fowling; this, with the Addition of some Peas, Beans, and such other Fruits of the Earth, as were then in Season, was the Families Dependance, and the Support of their Women and Children.</p>
                     <p>There are Four Sorts of <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, Two of which are early ripe, and Two, late ripe; all growing in the same manner; every single Grain of this when planted, produces a tall upright Stalk, which has several Ears hanging on the Sides of it, from Six to Ten Inches long. Each Ear is wrapt up in a Cover of many Folds, to protect it from the Injuries of the Weather. In every one of these Ears, are several Rows of Grain, set close to one another, with no other Partition, but of a very think Husk. So that oftentimes the Increase of this Grain amounts to above a Thousand for one.</p>
                     <p>The Two Sorts which are early ripe, are distinguish'd only by the Size, which shows it self as well in the Grain, as in the Ear, and the Stalk. There is some Difference also in the Time of ripening.</p>
                     <p>The lesser Size of Early ripe Corn, yields an Ear not much larger than the Handle of a Case Knife, and grows upon a Stalk, between Three and Four Foot high. Of this are commonly made Two
<pb n="29"/>
Crops in a Year, and, perhaps, there might be Heat enough in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> to ripen it.</p>
                     <p>The larger Sort differs from the former only in Largeness, the Ear of this being Seven or Eight Inches long, as thick as a Child's Leg, and growing upon a Stalk Nine or Ten Foot high. This is sit for eating about the latter End of <hi rend="italics">May,</hi> whereas the smaller Sort (generally speaking) affords Ears sit to roast by the Middle of <hi rend="italics">May.</hi> The Grains of both these Sorts, are as plump and swell'd, as if the Skin were ready to burst.</p>
                     <p>The late ripe Corn is diversify'd by the Shape of the Grain only, without any Respect to the accidental Differences in Colour, some being blue, some red, some yellow, some white, and some streak'd. That therefore which makes the Distinction, is the Plumpness or Shrivelling of the Grain; the one looks as smooth, and as full as the early ripe Corn, and this they call <hi rend="italics">Flint-Corn;</hi> the other has a larger Grain, and looks shrivell'd with a Dent on the Back of the Grain, as if it had never come to Perfection; and this they call <hi rend="italics">She-Corn.</hi> This is esteem'd by the Planters, as the best for Increase, and is universally chosen by them for planting; yet I can't see, but that this also produces the Flint-Corn, accidentally among the other.</p>
                     <p>All these Sorts are planted alike, in Rows, Three, Four or Five Grains in a Hill, the larger Sort at Four or Five Foot Distance, the lesser Sort nearer. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> used to give it One or Two Weedings, and make a Hill about it, and so the Labour was done. They likewise plant a Bean in the same Hill with the Corn, upon whose Stalk it sustains it self.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> sow'd Peas sometimes in the Intervals of the Rows of Corn, but more generally in a Patch of Ground by themselves. They have an unknown Variety of them, (but all of a Kidney-Shape) some
<pb n="30"/>
of which I have met with wild; but whence they had their <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, I can give no Account; for I don't believe that it was spontaneous in those Parts.</p>
                     <p>Their Potatoes are either red or white, about as long as a Boy's Leg, and sometimes as long and big as both the Leg and Thigh of a young Child, and very much resembling it in Shape. I take these Kinds to be the same with those, which are represented in the Herbals, to be <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi> Potatoes. I am sure, those call'd <hi rend="italics">English</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Irish</hi> Potatoes are nothing like these, either in Shape, Colour, or Taste. The Way of propagating Potatoes there, is by cutting the small ones to Pieces, and planting the Cuttings in Hills of loose Earth: But they are so tender, that it is very difficult to preserve them in the Winter; for the least Frost coming at them, rots and destroys them; and therefore People bury 'em under Ground, near the Fire-Hearth, all the Winter, until the Time comes, that their Seedings are to be set.</p>

But the Planters make a heavy Bustle with it now, and can't please the Market neither.</p>

                     <p>§. 21. AS for Fish, both of Fresh and Salt-Water, of Shell-Fish, and others, no Country can boast of more Variety, greater Plenty, or of better in their several Kinds.</p>
                     <pb n="31"/>
                     <p>In the Spring of the Year, Herrings come up in such abundance into their Brooks and Foards, to spawn, that it is almost impossible to ride through, without treading on them. Thus do those poor Creatures expose their own Lives to some Hazard, out of their Care to find a more convenient Reception for their Young, which are not yet alive. Thence it is, that at this Time of the Year, the Freshes of the Rivers, like that of the <hi rend="italics">Broadruck,</hi> stink of Fish.</p>
                     <p>Besides these Herrings, there come up likewise into the Freshes from the Sea, Multitudes of Shads, Rocks, Sturgeon, and some few Lampreys, which fasten themselves to the Shad, as the <hi rend="italics">Remora</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Imperatus</hi> is said to do to the Shark of <hi rend="italics">Tiburone.</hi> They continue their stay there about Three Months. The Shads at their first coming up, are fat and fleshy; but they waste so extreamly in Milting and Spawning, that at their going down they are poor, and seem fuller of Bones, only because they have less Flesh. It is upon this Account, (I suppose) that those in the <hi rend="italics">Severn,</hi> which in <hi rend="italics">Gloucester</hi> they call <hi rend="italics">Twaits,</hi> are said at first to want those intermusculary Bones, which afterwards they abound with. As these are in the Freshes, so the Salts afford at certain Times of the Year, many other Kinds of Fish in infinite Shoals, such as the Old-Wife, a Fish not much unlike an Herring, and the Sheep's-Head, a Sort of Fish, which they esteem in the Number of their best.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 22. There is likewise great Plenty of other Fish all the Summer long; and almost in every Part of the Rivers and Brooks, there are found of different Kinds: Wherefore I shall not pretend to give a Detail of them; but venture to mention the Names only of such as I have eaten and seen my self, and so leave the rest to those, that are better skill'd in Natural History. However, I may add, that besides all those
<pb n="32"/>
that I have met with my self, I have heard of a great many very good sorts, both in the Salts and Freshes; and such People too, as have not always spent their Time in that Country have commended them to me, beyond any they had ever eat before.</p>
                     <p>Those which I know of my self, I remember by the Names. Of Herrings, Rocks, Sturgeons, Shads, Old-Wives, Sheep's-Heads, Black and red Drums, Trouts, Taylors, Green-Fish, Sun-Fish, Bass, Chub, Place, Flounders, Whitings, Fatbacks, Maids, Wives, Small-Turtle, Crabs, Oisters, Mussels, Cockles, Shrimps, Needle-Fish, Breme, Carp, Pike, Jack, Mullets, Eels, Conger-Eels, Perch, and Cats, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Those which I remember to have seen there, of the Kinds that are not eaten, are the Whale, Porpus, Shark, Dog-Fish, Garr, Stingray, Thornback, Saw-Fish, Toad-Fish, Frog-Fish, Land-Crabs, Fidlers, and Periwinckles. One Day as I was halling a Sain upon the Salts, I caught a small Fish, about Two Inches and an Half long, in Shape something resembling a Scorpion, but of a Dirty dark Colour; I was a little shie of handling it, tho', I believe, there was no Hurt in it. This I judged to be that Fish, which Mr. <hi rend="italics">Purchase</hi> in his <hi rend="italics">Pilgrims,</hi> and Capt. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> in his General History, Pag. 28. affirm to be extreamly like St. <hi rend="italics">George</hi>'s Dragon, except only that it wants Feet and Wings.</p>

                     <p>§. 23. Before the Arrival of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> there, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had Fish in such vast Plenty, that the Boys and Girls wou'd take a pointed Stick, and strike the lesser sort, as they Swam upon the Flats. The larger Fish, that kept in deeper Water, they were put to a little more Difficulty to take; But for these they made Weyrs; that is, a Hedge of small riv'd Sticks, or Reeds, of the Thickness of a Man's Finger, these they wove together in a Row, with Straps of
<pb n="33"/>
Green Oak, or other tough Wood, so close that the small Fish cou'd not pass through. Upon High-Water Mark, they pitched one End of this Hedge, and the other they extended into the River, to the Depth of Eight or Ten Foot, fastening it with Stakes, making Cods out from the Hedge on one side, almost at the End, and leaving a Gap for the Fish to go into them, which were contrived so, that the Fish could easily find their Passage into those Cods, when they were at the Gap, but not see their Way out again, when they were in: Thus if they offered to pass through, they were taken.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they made such a Hedge as this, quite a-cross a Creek at High-Water, and at Low wou'd go into the Run, so contracted into a narrow Compass, and take out what Fish they pleased.</p>
                     <p>At the Falls of the Rivers, where the Water is shallow, and the Current strong, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> use another kind of Weir, thus made: They make a Dam of loose Stone, whereof there is plenty at hand, quite a-cross the River, leaving One, Two, or more Spaces or Tunnels, for the Water to pass thro'; at the Mouth of which they set a Pot of Reeds, wove in Form of a Cone, whose Base is about Three Foot, and perpendicular Ten, into which the Swiftness of the Current carries the Fish, and wedges them so fast, that they cannot possibly return.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Way of Catching Sturgeon, when they came into the narrow part of the Rivers, was by a Man's clapping a Noose over their Tail, and by keeping fast his hold. Thus a Fish finding it self intangled, wou'd flounce, and often pull him under Water, and then that Man was counted a <hi rend="italics">Cockarouse,</hi> or brave Fellow, that wou'd not let go; till with Swimming, Wading, and Diving, he had tired the Sturgeon, and brought it ashore. These Sturgeons would also often leap into their Canoes, in crossing the River, as many of them do still every Year, into the Boats of the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="34"/>
                     <p>They have also another Way of Fishing like those on the <hi rend="italics">Euxine</hi> Sea, by the Help of a blazing Fire by Night. They make a Hearth in the Middle of their Canoe, raising it within Two Inches of the Edge; upon this they lay their burning Light-Wood, split into small Shivers, each Splinter whereof will blaze and burn End for End, like a Candle: 'Tis one Man's Work to tend this Fire and keep it flaming. At each End of the Canoe stands an <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> with a Gig, or pointed Spear, setting the Canoe forward with the Butt-end of the Spear, as gently as he can, by that Means stealing upon the Fish, without any Noise, or disturbing of the Water. Then they with great Dexterity, dart these Spears into the Fish, and so take 'em. Now there is a double Convenience in the Blaze of this Fire; for it not only dazzles the Eyes of the Fish, which will lie still, glaring upon it, but likewise discovers the Bottom of the River clearly to the Fisher-man, which the Day-light does not.</p>
                     <p>The following Print, (as all the others in this Book,) was drawn by the Life, and I may justly affirm it, to be a very true Representation of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Fishery.</p>

                     <p>§. 24. 'Tis a good Diversion to observe the Manner of the Fishing-Hawks preying upon Fish, which may be seen every fair Day all the Summer long, and especially in a Morning. At the first coming of the Fish in the Spring, these Birds of Prey are surprizingly eager. I believe, in the Dead of Winter, they Fish farther off at Sea, or remain among the craggy uninhabited Islands, upon the Sea Coast. I have often been pleasantly entertain'd, by seeing these Hawks take the Fish out of the Water, and as they were flying away with their Quarry, the bald Eagles take it from them again. I have often observ'd the first of these hover over the Water, and rest upon the Wing, some Minutes together, without the least change of Place, and then from a vast Height, dart directly into the Water, and there plunge down for the Space of Half a Minute, or more, and at last bring up with him a Fish, which he could hardly rise with; then, having got upon the Wing again, he wou'd shake himself so powerfully, that he threw the Water like a Mist about him; afterwards away he'd fly to the Woods with his Game, if he were not overlook'd by the Bald-Eagle, and robb'd by the Way, which very frequently happens. For the Bald-Eagle no sooner perceives a Hawk that has taken his Prey, but he immediately pursues, and strives to get above him in the Air, which if he can once attain, the Hawk for fear of being torn by him, lets the Fish drop, and so by the Loss of his Dinner, compounds for his own Safety. The poor Fish is no sooner loosed from the Hawk's Tallons, but the Eagle shoots himself, with wonderful Swiftness, after it, and catches it in the Air, leaving all further Pursuit
<pb n="36"/>
of the Hawk, which has no other Remedy, but to go and fish for another.</p>
                     <p>Walking once with a Gentleman in an Orchard by the River-side, early in the Spring, before the Fish were by us perceiv'd to appear in Shoal-Water, or near the Shores, and before any had been caught by the People; we heard a great Noise in the Air just over our Heads, and looking up, we see an Eagle in close pursuit of a Hawk, that had a great Fish in his Pounces. The Hawk was as low as the Apple-Trees, before he wou'd let go his Fish, thinking to recover the Wood, which was just by, where the Eagles dare never follow, for fear of bruising themselves. But, notwithstanding the Fish was dropp'd so low, and tho' it did not fall above Thirty Yards from us, yet we with our Hollowing, Running, and casting up our Hats, could hardly save the Fish from the Eagle, and if it had been dropp'd Two Yards higher, he wou'd have got it: But we at last took Possession of it alive, carried it Home, and had it dressed forthwith. It serv'd Five of us very plentifully, without any other Addition, and some to the Servants. This Fish was a Rock near Two Foot long, very fat, and a great Rarity for the Time of Year, as well as for the Manner of its being taken.</p>
                     <p>These Fishing-Hawks, in more plentiful Seasons, will catch a Fish, and loiter about with it in the Air, on purpose to have a Chace with an Eagle; and when he does not appear soon enough, the Hawk will make a sawcy Noise, and insolently defie him. This has been frequently seen, by Persons who have observ'd their Fishings.</p>

                     <p>§. 25. As in Summer, the Rivers and Creeks are fill'd with Fish, so in Winter they are in many Places cover'd with Fowl. There are such a Multitude of Swans, Geese, Brants, Sheldrakes, Ducks of several Sorts, Mallard, Teal, Blewings, and many other Kinds of Water-Fowl, that the Plenty of them is incredible. I am but a small Sports-man, yet with a Fowling-Peice, have kill'd above Twenty of them at a Shot. In like manner are the Mill-Ponds, and great Runs in the Woods stor'd with these Wild-Fowl, at certain Seasons of the Year.</p>

The Shores, Marshy Grounds, Swamps, and Savanna's, are also stor'd with the like Plenty of other Game, of all Sorts, as Cranes, Curlews, Herons, Snipes, Woodcocks, Saurers, Ox-eyes, Plover, Larks, and many other good Birds for the Table that they have not yet found a Name for. Not to mention Beavers, Otters, Musk-Rats, Minxes, and an infinite Number of other wild Creatures.</p>

Altho' the Inner Lands want these Benefits, (which, however, no Pond or Slash is without,) yet even they, have the Advantage of Wild Turkeys, of an incridible Bigness, Pheasants, Partridges, Pigeons, and an Infinity of small Birds, as well as Deer, Hairs, Foxes, Raccoons, Squirrels, Possums. And upon the Frontier Plantations, they meet with Pears, Panthers, Wild-Cats, Elks, Buffaloes, and Wild Hogs, which yield Pleasure, as well as Profit to the Sports-man. And tho' some of these Names may
<pb n="38"/>
seem frightful to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> who hear not of them in their own Country; yet they are not so there; for all these Creatures ever fly from the Face of Man, doing no Damage but to the Cattle and Hogs, which the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> never troubled themselves about.</p>
                     <p>Here I can't omit a strange Rarity in the Female <hi rend="italics">Possum,</hi> which I my self have seen. They have a false Belly, or loose Skin quite over the Belly; this never sticks to the Flesh of the Belly, but may be look'd into at all Times, after they have been concern'd in Procreation. In the Hinder-Part of this, is an Overture big enough for a small Hand to pass into: Hither the young Ones, after they are full hair'd, and strong enough to run about, do fly when ever any Danger appears, or when they go to rest, or suck. This they continue till they have learn'd to live without the Dam: But, what is yet stranger, the young Ones are bred in this false Belly, without ever being within the true One. They are form'd at the Teat, and there they grow for several Weeks together into perfect Shape, becoming visibly larger, till at last they get Strength, Sight, and Hair; and then they drop off, and rest in this false Belly, going in and out at Pleasure. I have observed them thus fasten'd at the Teat, from the Bigness of a Flie, until they became as large as a Mouse. Neither is it any Hurt to the old One to open this Budget, and look in upon her Young.</p>

                     <p>§. 28. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had no other Way of taking their Water or Land-Fowl, but by the Help of Bows, and Arrows: Yet, so great was their Plenty that with this Weapon only, they kill'd what Numbers they pleased. And when the Water-Fowl kept far from Shore, <hi rend="italics">(</hi>as in warmer Weather they sometimes did,<hi rend="italics">)</hi> they took their Canoes, and paddl'd after them.</p>
                     <pb n="39"/>
                     <p>But they had a better Way of killing the Elks, Buffaloes, Deer, and greater Game, by a Method which we call Fire-Hunting: That is, a Company of them wou'd go together back into the Woods, any time in the Winter, when the Leaves were fallen, and so dry, that they wou'd burn; and being come to the Place design'd, they wou'd Fire the Woods, in a Circle of Five or Six Miles Compass; and when they had compleated the first Round, they retreated inward, each at his due Distance, and put Fire to the Leaves and Grass afresh, to accelerate the Work, which ought to be finished with the Day. This they repeat, till the Circle be so contracted, that they can see their Game herded all together in the Middle, panting and almost stifled with Heat and Smoak; for the poor Creatures being frighten'd at the Flame, keep running continually round, thinking to run from it, and dare not pass through the Fire; by which Means they are brought at last into a very narrow Compass. Then the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> let flie their Arrows at them, and (which is very strange) tho' they stand all round quite clouded in Smoak, yet they rarely shoot each other. By this means they destroy all the Beasts, collected within that Circle. They make all this Slaughter only for the sake of the Skins, leaving the Carcases to perish in the Woods.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi rend="italics">Verbiast,</hi> in his Description of the Emperor of <hi rend="italics">China</hi>'s Voyage into the Eastern <hi rend="italics">Tarray,</hi> Anno 1682, gives an Account of a Way of Hunting the <hi rend="italics">Tartars</hi> have, not much unlike this, only whereas the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> surround their Game with Fire, the <hi rend="italics">Tartars</hi> do it with a great Body of armed Men, who having environ'd the Ground they design to drive, march equally inwards, which, still as the Ring lessens, brings the Men nearer each other, till at length the wild Beasts are incompassed with a living Wall.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have many pretty Inventions, to discover and come up to the Deer, Turkeys and other
<pb n="40"/>
Game undiscern'd; but that being an Art, known to very few <hi rend="italics">English</hi> there, I will not be so accessary to the Destruction of their Game, as to make it publick. I shall therefore only tell you, that when they go a Hunting into the Out-lands, they commonly go out for the whole Season, with their Wives and Family. At the Place where they find the most Game, they build up a convenient Number of small Cabbins, wherein they live during that Season. These Cabbins are both begun, and finished in Two or Three Days, and after the Season is over, they make no further Account of them.</p>

This and a great deal more was the natural Production of that Country, which the Native <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> enjoy'd, without the Curse of Industry, their Diversion alone, and not their Labour, supplying their Necessities. The Women and Children indeed, were so far provident, as to lay up some of the Nuts, and Fruits of the Earth, in their Season, for their further Occasions: But none of the Toils of Husbandry were exercised by this happy People; except the bare planting a little Corn, and Melons, which took up only a few Days in the Summer, the rest being wholly spent in the Pursuit of their Pleasures. And indeed all that the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> have done, since their going thither, has been only to make some of these Native Pleasures more scarce, by an inordinate and unseasonable Use of them; hardly making Improvements equivalent to that Damage.</p>

outward frame, that I never heard of one single <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> that was either dwarfish, crooked, bandylegg'd, or otherwise mis-shapen. But if they have any such practice among them, as the <hi rend="italics">Romans</hi> had, of exposing such Children till they dyed, as were weak and mis shapen at their Birth, they are very shy of confessing it, and I could never yet learn that they had.</p>
                     <p>Their Colour, when they are grown up, is a Chesnut brown and tawny; but much clearer in their Infancy. Their Skin comes afterwards to harden and grow blacker, by greasing and Sunning themselves. They have generally coal black Hair, and very black Eyes, which are most commonly grac'd with that sort of Squint which many of the <hi rend="italics">Jews</hi> are observ'd to have. Their Women are generally Beautiful, possessing an uncommon delicacy of Shape and Features, and wanting no Charm, but that of a fair Complexion.</p>

                     <p>§. 2. The Men wear their Hair cut after several fanciful Fashions, sometimes greas'd, and sometimes painted. The Great Men, or better sort, preserve a long Lock behind for distinction. They pull their Beards up by the roots with a Muscleshell; and both Men and Women do the same by the other parts of their Body for Cleanliness sake. The Women wear the Hair of the Head very long, either hanging at their Backs, or brought before in a single Lock, bound up with a Fillet of Peak, or Beads; sometimes also they wear it neatly tyed up in a Knot behind. It is commonly greased, and shining black, but never painted.</p>
                     <p>The People of Condition of both Sexes, wear a sort of Coronet on their Heads, from 4 to 6 inches broad, open at the top, and composed of Peak, or Beads, or else of both interwoven together, and workt into Figures, made by a nice mixture of the

The upper part of this Mantle is drawn close upon the Shoulders, and the other hangs below their Knees. When that's thrown off, they have only for Modesty sake a piece of Cloath, or a small Skin, tyed round their Waste, which reaches down to the middle of the Thigh. The common sort tye only a String round their Middle, and pass a piece of Cloath or Skin round between their Thighs, which they turn at each end over the String.</p>
                     <p>Their Shoes, when they wear any, are made of an entire piece of Buck-Skin; except when they sow a piece to the bottom, to thicken the Soal.

                     <p>The Habit of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Priest, is a Cloak made in the form of a Woman's Petticoat; but instead of tying it about their middle, they fasten the gatherings about their Neck, and tye it upon the Right Shoulder, always keeping one Arm out to use upon occasion. This Cloak hangs even at the bottom,
<pb n="6"/>
but reaches no lower than the middle of the Thigh; but what is most particular in it, is, that it is constantly made of a skin drest soft, with the Pelt or Furr on the outside, and revers'd; insomuch, that when the Cloak has been a little worn, the hair falls down in flakes, and looks very shagged, and frightful.</p>
                     <p>The cut of their Hair is likewise peculiar to their Function; for 'tis all shaven close except a thin Crest, like a Cocks-comb which stands bristling up, and runs in a semi-circle from the Forehead up along the Crown to the nape of the Neck: They likewise have a border of Hair over the Forehead, which by its own natural strength, and by the stiffning it receives from Grease and Paint, will stand out like the peak of a Bonnet.</p>

Notwithstanding they allow both the Man and the Wife to part upon disagreement; yet so great is the disreputation of a Divorce, that Marry'd people, to avoid the Character of Inconstant and Ungenerous, very rarely let their Quarrels proceed to a Separation. However, when it does so happen, they reckon all the ties of Matrimony dissolv'd, and each hath the liberty of marrying another. But Infidelity is accounted the most unpardonable of all Crimes in either of the Parties, as long as the Contract continues.</p>
                     <p>In these Separations, the Children go, according to the affection of the Parent, with the one or the other; for Children are not reckon'd a Charge among them, but rather Riches, according to the blessing of the Old Testament; and if they happen to differ about dividing their Children, their method is then, to part them equally, allowing the Man the first choice.</p>

'em the justice to say, I never heard of a Child any of them had before Marriage, and the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> themselves disown any such custom; tho they acknowledge at the same time, that the Maidens are entirely at their own disposal, and may manage their persons as they think fit.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I believe this Story to be an aspersion cast on those innocent Creatures, by reason of the freedom they take in Conversation, which uncharitable Christians interpret as Criminal, upon no other ground, than the guilt of their own Consciences.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Damsels are full of spirit, and from thence are always inspir'd with Mirth and good Humour.

However, this is ground enough for the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> who are not very nice in distinguishing betwixt guilt, and harmless freedom, to think them Incontinent: Tho it be with as little justice, as the jealous <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> condemn the liberty us'd by the Women of <hi rend="italics">France,</hi> which are much more chast than their own Ladies, which they keep under the strictest confinement.</p>

The manner of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> treating their young Children is very strange, for instead of keeping them warm, at their first entry into the World, and wrapping them up, with I don't know how many Cloaths, according to our fond custom; the first thing they do, is to dip the Child over Head and Ears in cold Water, and then to bind it naked to a convenient Board, having a hole fitly plac'd for evacuation; but they always put Cotton, Wool, Furr, or other soft thing, for the Body to rest easy on, between the Child and the Board. In this posture they keep it several months, till the Bones begin to harden, the Joynts to knit, and the
<pb n="10"/>
Limbs to grow strong; and then they let it loose from the Board, suffering it to crawl about, except when they are feeding, or playing with it.</p>
                     <p>While the Child is thus at the Board, they either lay it flat on its back, or set it leaning on one end, or else hang it up by a string fasten'd to the upper end of the Board for that purpose. The Child and Board being all this while carry'd about together. As our Women undress their Children to clean them and shift their Linnen, so they do theirs to wash and grease them.</p>
                     <p>The method the Women have of carrying their Children after they are suffer'd to crawl about, is very particular; they carry them at their backs in Summer, taking one Leg of the Child under their Arm, and the Counter Arm of the Child in their Hand over their Shoulder; the other Leg hanging down, and the Child all the while holding fast with its other Hand; but in Winter they carry them in the hollow of their Match-coat at their back, leaving nothing but the Child's Head out, as appears by the Figure.</p>

The manner the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have of building their Houses, is very slight and cheap; when they would erect a <hi rend="italics">Wigwang,</hi> which is the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> name for a House, they stick Saplins into the ground by one end, and bend the other at the top, fastening them together by strings made of fibrous Roots, the rind of Trees, or of the green Wood of the white Oak, which will rive into Thongs. The smallest sort of these Cabbins are conical like a Bee-hive; but the larger are built in an oblong form, and both are cover'd with the Bark of Trees, which will rive off into great flakes. Their Windows are little holes left open for the passage of the Light, which in bad weather they stop with Shutters of the same Bark, opening the Leeward Windows for Air and Light. Their Chimney, as among the true Born <hi rend="italics">Irish,</hi> is a little hole in the top of the House, to let out the Smoak, having no sort of Funnel, or any thing within, to confine the Smoke from ranging through the whole Roof of the Cabbins, if the vent will not let it out fast enough. The Fire is always made in the middle of the Cabbin. Their Door is a Pendent Mat, when they are near home; but when they go abroad, they barricado it with great Logs of Wood set against the Mat, which are sufficient to keep out Wild Beasts. There's never more than one Room in a House, except in some Houses of State, or Religion,

where the Partition is made only by Mats, and loose Poles.</p>

Their Houses or Cabbins, as we call them, are by this ill method of Building, continually Smoaky, when they have Fire in them; but to ease that inconvenience, and to make the Smoak less troublesome to their Eyes, they generally burn Pine, or Lightwood, (that is, the fat knots of dead Pine) the Smoak of which does not offend the Eyes, but smuts the Skin exceedingly, and is perhaps another occasion of the darkness of their Complexion.</p>

                     <p>They take up their Lodging in the sides of their Cabbins upon a Couch made of Board, Sticks, or Reeds, which are rais'd from the Ground upon Forks, and cover'd with Mats or Skins. Sometimes they lye upon a Bear Skin, or other thick Pelt drest with the Hair on, and laid upon the Ground near a Fire, covering themselves with their Match-coats. In warm weather a single Mat is their only Bed, and another roll'd up, their Pillow. In their Travels, a Grass-plat under the covert of a shady Tree, is all the lodgings they require, and is as pleasant and refreshing to them, as a Down Bed and fine <hi rend="italics">Holland</hi> Sheets are to us.</p>

<pb n="13"/>
their Kings Houses, and as many others as they judge sufficient to harbour all their People, when an Enemy comes against them. They never fail to secure within their Palisado, all their Religious Reliques, and the Remains of their Princes.

They are very patient of Hunger, when by any accident they happen to have nothing to eat; which they make more easy to them by girding up their Bellies, just as the wild <hi rend="italics">Arabs</hi> are said to do, in their long marches; by which means they are less sensible of the impressions of Hunger.</p>

They make no other provision for their Journey, but their Gun or Bow, to supply them with Food for many hundred miles together. If they carry any Flesh in their marches, they barbicue it, or rather dry it by degrees, at some distance, over the clear Coals of a Wood fire; just as the <hi rend="italics">(haribees</hi> are said, to preserve the Bodies of their Kings and Great men from Corruption. Their Sauce to this dry Meat, (if they have any besides a good Stomach) is only a little Bears Oyl, or Oyl of Acorns; which last they force out, by boyling the Acorns in a strong Lye. Sometimes also in their Travels, each man takes with him a pint or quart of <hi rend="italics">Rockahomonie,</hi> that is, the finest <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> Corn, parched, and beaten to powder. When they find their Stomach empty, (and cannot stay for the tedious Cookery of other things,) they put about a spoonful of this into their Mouths, and drink a draught of Water upon it, which stays their Stomachs, and enables them to pursue their Journey without delay. But their main dependence is upon the Game they kill by the way, and the natural Fruits of the Earth. They take no care about Lodging in these Journeys; but content themselves with the shade of a Tree, or a little High Grass.</p>
                     <p>When they fear being discover'd, or follow'd by an Enemy in their Marches; they, every morning, having first agreed where they shall rendezvouze<pb n="19"/>
 at night, disperse themselves into the Woods, and each takes a several way, that so, the Grass or Leaves being but singly prest, may rise again, and not betray them. For the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are very artful in following a track, even where the Impressions are not visible to other People, especially if they have any advantage from the looseness of the Earth, from the stiffness of the Grass, or the stirring of the Leaves, which in the Winter Season lye very thick upon the ground; and likewise afterwards, if they do not happen to be burned.</p>
                     <p>When in their Travels, they meet with any Waters, which are not fordable, they make Canoas of Birch Bark, by slipping it whole off the Tree, in this manner. First, they gash the Bark quite round the Tree, at the length they wou'd have the Canoe of, then slit down the length from end to end; when that is done, they with their <hi rend="italics">Tomahawks</hi> easily open the Bark, and strip it whole off. Then they force it open with Sticks in the middle, slope the underside of the ends, and sow them up, which helps to keep the Belly open; or if the Birch Trees happen to be small, they sow the Bark of two together; The Seams they dawb with Clay or Mud, and then pass over in these Canoes, by two, three, or more at a time, according as they are in bigness. By reason of the lightness of these Boats, they can easily carry them over Land, if they foresee that they are like to meet with any more Waters, that may impede their March; or else they leave them at the Water-side, making no farther account of them; except it be to repass the same Waters in their return. See the resemblance Tab. 16.</p>

<pb n="20"/>
each others Language: and that is by a singular method of smoaking Tobacco; in which these things are always observ'd.</p>
                     <p>1. They take a Pipe much larger and bigger than the common Tobacco Pipe, expressly made for that purpose, with which all Towns are plentifully provided; they call them the Pipes of Peace.</p>
                     <p>2. This Pipe they always fill with Tobacco, before the Face of the Strangers, and light it.</p>
                     <p>3. The chief Man of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> to whom the Strangers come, takes two or three Whiffs, and then hands it to the chief of the Strangers.</p>
                     <p>4. If the Stranger refuses to Smoke in it, 'tis a sign of War.</p>
                     <p>5. If it be Peace, the chief of the Strangers takes a Whiff or two in the Pipe, and presents it to the next Great Man of the Town, they come to visit; he, after taking two or three Whiffs, gives it back to the next of the Strangers, and so on alternately, until they have past all the persons of Note on each side, and then the Ceremony is ended.</p>
                     <p>After a little discourse, they march together in a friendly manner into the Town, and then proceed to explain the Business upon which they came. This Method is as general a Rule among all the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of those parts of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> as the Flag of Truce is among the <hi rend="italics">Europeans.</hi> And tho the fashion of the Pipe differ, as well as the ornaments of it, according to the humour of the several Nations, yet 'tis a general Rule, to make these Pipes remarkably bigger, than those for common use, and to adorn them with beautiful Wings, and Feathers of Birds, as likewise with Peak, Beads, or other such Foppery. Father <hi rend="italics">Lewis Henepin</hi> gives a particular description of one, that he took notice of, among the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> upon the Lakes wherein he Travell'd. He describes it by the Name of <hi rend="italics">Calumet</hi>
                        <pb n="21"/>
of Peace, and his words are these, Book I. Chap. 24.</p>
                     <p>“This <hi rend="italics">Calumet</hi> is the most mysterious thing in the World, among the Salvages of the Continent of the Northern <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> for it is used in all their important transactions: However, it is nothing else but a large Tobacco pipe, made of red, black or white Marble: The Head is finely polished, and the Quill, which is commonly two foot and an half long, is made of a pretty strong Reed, or Cane, adorn'd with Feathers of all Colours, interlac'd with Locks of Womens Hair. They tye it to two Wings of the most curious Birds they can find, which makes their <hi rend="italics">Calumet</hi> not much unlike <hi rend="italics">Mercury's</hi> Wand, or that Staff Ambassadors did formerly carry, when they went to treat of Peace. They sheath that Reed into the Neck of Birds they call <hi rend="italics">Huars,</hi> which are as big as our Geese, and spotted with black and white; or else of a sort of Ducks, which make their Nests upon Trees, tho the Water be their ordinary element; and whose Feathers be of many different colours. However, every Nation adorns their <hi rend="italics">Calumet</hi> as they think fit, according to their own genius, and the Birds they have in their Country.</p>
                     <p>“Such a Pipe is a Pass and Safe Conduct among all the Allies of the Nation who has given it. And in all Embassies, the Ambassador carries that <hi rend="italics">Calumet,</hi> as the Symbol of Peace, which is always respected: For, the Salvages are generally perswaded, that a great misfortune would befall them, if they violated the Publick Faith of the <hi rend="italics">Calumet.</hi>

                     <p>“All their Enterprizes, Declarations of War, or Conclusions of Peace, as well as all the rest of their Ceremonies, are Seal'd, (if I may be permitted to say so) with this <hi rend="italics">Calumet:</hi> They fill that

First, the King or Queen, with a Guard, and a great Retinue, march out of the Town, a quarter or half a mile, and carry Mats for their accommodation; when they meet the Strangers, they invite them to sit down upon those Mats. Then they pass the Ceremony of the Pipe, and afterwards, having spent about half an hour in grave discourse, they get up all together, and march into the Town.

They esteem it a breach of Hospitality, not to submit to every thing he desires of them. This kind Ceremony is us'd only to Men of great Distinction: And the Young Women are so far from suffering in their Reputation for this Civility, that they are envy'd for it by all the other Girls, as having had the greatest Honour done them in the World.</p>

<pb n="28"/>
For which reason, I think my self oblig'd sincerely to deliver what I can warrant to be true upon my own knowledge; it being neither my Interest, nor any part of my Vanity to impose upon the World.</p>
                     <p>I have been at several of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Towns, and conversed with some of the most sensible of them in that Country; but I cou'd learn little from them, it being reckon'd Sacriledge, to divulge the principles of their Religion. However, the following Adventure discover'd something of it. As I was ranging the Woods, with some other Friends, we fell upon their <hi rend="italics">Quioccosan</hi> (which is their House of Religious Worship) at a time, when the whole Town were gathered together in another place, to consult about the bounds of the Land given them by the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus finding our selves Masters of so fair an opportunity, (because we knew the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> were engaged,) we resolved to make use of it, and to examine their <hi rend="italics">Quioccasan,</hi> the inside of which, they never suffer any <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Man to see; and having removed about fourteen Loggs from the Door, with which it was barricado'd, we went in, and at first found nothing but naked Walls, and a Fire place in the middle. This House was about eighteen foot wide, and thirty foot long, built after the manner of their other Cabbins, but larger, with a Hole in the middle of the Root, to vent the Smoke, the Door being at one end: Round about the House, at some distance from it, were set up Posts, with Faces carved on them, and painted. We did not observe any Window, or passage for the Light, except the Door, and the vent of the Chimney. At last, we observ'd, that at the farther end, about ten foot of the Room, was cut off by a Partition of very close Mats; and it was dismal dark behind that Partition. We were at first scrupulous to enter this
<pb n="29"/>
obscure place, but at last we ventur'd, and groping about, we felt some Posts in the middle; then reaching our hands up those Posts, we found large Shelves, and upon these Shelves three Mats, each of which was roll'd up, and sow'd fast. These we handed down to the light, and to save time in unlacing the Seams, we made use of a Knife, and ripp'd them, without doing any damage to the Mats. In one of these we found some vast Bones, which we judg'd to be the Bones of Men, particularly we measur'd one Thigh-bone, and found it two foot nine inches long : In another Mat, we found some <hi rend="italics">Indian Tomahawks</hi> finely grav'd, and painted. These resembl'd the wooden Faulchion us'd by the Prize fighters in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> except that they have no guard to save the Fingers. They were made of a rough heavy Wood, and the shape of them is represented in the Tab. 10. No 3. Among these <hi rend="italics">Tomahawks</hi> was the largest that ever I saw; there was fasten'd to it a Wild Turky's Beard painted red, and two of the longest Feathers of his Wings hung dangling at it, by a string of about 6 Inches long, ty'd to the end of the <hi rend="italics">Tomahawk.</hi> In the third Mat there was something, which we took to be their Idol, tho of an underling sort, and wanted putting together. The pieces were these, first a Board three foot and a half long, with one indenture at the upper end, like a Fork, to fasten the Head upon, from thence half way down, were Half hoops nail'd to the edges of the Board, at about four Inches distance, which were bow'd out, to represent the Breast and Belly; on the lower half was another Board of half the length of the other, fasten'd to it by Joynts or pieces of Wood, which being set on each side, stood out about 14 inches from the Body, and half as high; we suppos'd the use of these to be for the bowing out of the Knees, when the Image was set up. There were<pb n="30"/>
packt up with these things, red and blue pieces of Cotton Cloath, and  Rolls made up for Arms, Thighs and Legs, bent to at the Knees, as is represented in the Figure of their Idol, which was taken by an exact  Drawer in the Country.  It wou'd be difficult to see one of these Images at this day, because the Indians are extreme shy of exposing them.  We put the Cloaths upon the Hoops for the Body, and fasten'd on the Arms and Legs, to have a view of the representation: But the Head and rich Bracelets, which it is usually adorn'd with, were not there, or at least we did not find them.  We had not leisure to make a very narrow search; for having spent about an hour in this enquiry, we fear'd the business of the Indians might be near over; and that if we staid longer, we might be caught offering an affront to their Superstition; for this reason we wrapt up these Holy materials in their several Mats again, and laid them on the Shelf, where we found them.  This Image when drest up, might look very venerable in that dark place; where ’tis not possible to see it, but by the glimmering light,  that is let in, by lifting up a piece of the Matting, which we observ'd to be conveniently hung for that purpose; for when the light of the Door and Chimney, glance in several directions, upon the Image thro that little passage, it must needs make a strange representation, which those poor people are taught to worship with a devout Ignorance.  There are other things that contribute towards carrying on this Imposture; first the chief Conjurer enters within the Partition in the dark, and may undiscern'd move the Image as he pleases: Secondly, a Priest of Authority stands in the room with the people, to keep them from being too inquisitive, under the penalty of the Deity's displeasure, and his 
own censure.</p>

                     <p>Once in my Travels, in very cold Weather, I met at an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> man's House with an <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> of whom an extraordinary Character had been given me, for his Ingenuity and Understanding. When I see he had no other <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> with him, I thought I might be the more free; and therefore I made much of him, seating him close by a large Fire, and giving him plenty of strong Cyder, which I hop'd wou'd make him good Company, and open-hearted. After I found him well warm'd (for unless they be surprized some way or other, they will not talk freely of their Religion) I asked him concerning their God, and what their Notions of Him were? He freely told me, they believ'd God was universally beneficent, that his Dwelling was in the Heavens above, and that the Influences of his Goodness reach'd to the earth beneath. That he was incomprehensible in his Excellence, and enjoy'd all possible Felicity: That his Duration was Eternal, his Perfection boundless, and that he possesses everlasting Indolence and Ease. I told him, I had heard that they Worshipped the Devil, and asked why they did not rather Worship God, whom they had so high an opinion of, and who wou'd give them all good things, and protect them from any Mischief that the Devil could do them? To this his answer was, That, 'tis true, God is the giver of all good things, but they flow naturally and promiscuously from him; that they are showr'd down upon all Men indifferently without distinction; that God do's not trouble himself, with the impertinent affairs of Men, nor is concern'd at what they do: but leaves them to make the most of their Free Will, and to secure as many as they can, of the good things that flow from him. That therefore it was to no, purpose either to fear,
<pb n="33"/>
or Worship him: But on the contrary, if they did not pacify the Evil Spirit, and make him propitious, he wou'd take away, or spoil all those good things that God had given, and ruine their Health, their Peace and their Plenty, by sending War, Plague and Famine among them; for, said he, this Evil Spirit, is always busying himself with our affairs, and frequently visiting us, being present in the Air, in the Thunder, and in the Storms. He told me farther, That he expected Adoration and Sacrifice from them, on pain of his displeasure; and that therefore they thought it convenient to make their Court to him. I then asked him concerning the image, which they Worship in their <hi rend="italics">Quioccasan;</hi> and assur'd him, that it was a dead insensible Log, equipt with a bundle of Clouts, a meer helpless thing made by Men, that could neither hear, see, nor speak; and that such a stupid thing could no ways hurt, or help them. To this he answer'd very unwillingly, and with much hesitation; However, he at last deliver'd himself in these broken and imperfect sentences; <hi rend="italics">It is the Priests — they make the people believe, and</hi> — Here he paus'd a little, and then repeated to me, that <hi rend="italics">it was the Priests</hi> — and then gave me hopes that he wou'd have said something more, but a qualm crost his Conscience, and hinder'd him from making any farther Confession.</p>

                     <p>Captain <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> describes the particular manner of a Conjuration that was made about him, while he was a Prisoner amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> at the <hi rend="italics">Pamaunkie</hi> Town, in the first settlement of the Country; and after that, I'll tell you of another of a more modern date, which I had from a very good hand. <hi rend="italics">Smith'</hi>s words are these.</p>
                     <p>“Early in the Morning a great Fire was made in a long House, and a Mat spread on the one side and on the other: On the one they caus'd him to sit, and all the Guard went our of the House; and presently there came skipping in a great grim Fellow, all painted over with Coal mingl'd
<pb n="35"/>
with Oyl, and many Snakes and Weasel Skins stufft with Moss, and all their Tails ty'd together, so as they met in the Crown of his Head, like a Tossil, and round about the Tossil was a Coroner of Feathers, the Skins hanging round about his Head, Back and Shoulders, and in a manner covering his Face; with a hellish Voice, and a Rattle in his Hand, with most strange gestures and postures he began his Invocation, and environ'd the Fire with a Circle of Meal; which done, three more such like Devils came rushing in with the like Antick Tricks, painted half black, half red; but all their Eyes were painted white, and some great strokes, like Mustachoes along their Cheeks: Round about him these Fiends danced a pretty while; and then came in three more as ugly as the rest, with red Eyes and white strokes over their black Faces: At last they all sat down right against him, 3 of them on one hand of the Chief Priest, and three on the other. Then all of them with their Rattles began a Song; which ended, the Chief Priest laid down five Wheat Corns; then straining his Arms and Hands with such violence that he sweat, and his Veins swell'd, he began a short Oration: At the conclusion they all gave a short groan, and then laid down three grains more; after that, began their Song again, and then another Oration, ever laying down so many Corns as before, till they had twice encircled the Fire: That done, they took a bunch of little Sticks prepar'd for that purpose, continuing still their Devotion; and at the end of every Song and Oration they laid down a Stick betwixt the divisions of Corn. Till night neither he nor they did eat or drink, and then they feasted merrily, with the best provisions they could make. Three days they used
<pb n="36"/>
this Ceremony, the meaning whereof they told him, was to know, if he intended them well or no. The Circle of Meal signified their Country, the Circles of Corn, the bounds of the Sea, and the Sticks his Country. They imagined the World to be flat and round like a Trencher, and they in the midst.<corr>”</corr>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far is <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi>'s Story of Conjuration concerning himself, but when he says they encircled the Fire with Wheat, I am apt to believe, he means their <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn; which some, contrary to the custome of the rest of Mankind, will still call by the name of <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Wheat.</p>
                     <p>The later Story of Conjuration is this, Some few years ago, there happen'd a very dry time, towards the heads of the Rivers, and especially on the upper parts of <hi rend="italics">James River,</hi> where Collonel <hi rend="italics">Byrd</hi> had several Quarters of Negroes. This Gentleman has for a long time been extreamly respected, and fear'd by all the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> round about, who, without knowing the Name of any Governour, have ever been kept in order by Him. During this drowth, an <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> well known to one of the Collonel's Overseers, came to him, and ask'd if his Tobacco was not like to be spoyl'd? The Overseer answer'd Yes, if they had not Rain very suddenly: The <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> who pretended great kindness for his Master, told the Overseer, if he would promise to give him two Bottles of Rum, he would bring him Rain enough: The Overseer did not believe any thing of the matter, not seeing at that time the least appearance of Rain, nor so much as a Cloud in the Sky; however, he promis'd to give him the Rum, when his Master came thither, if he wou'd be as good as his word: Upon this the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> went immediately a <hi rend="italics">Pauwawing,</hi> as they call it; and in about half an hour, there came up a black Cloud into the Sky, that shower'd down Rain
<pb n="37"/>
enough upon this Gentlemans Corn and Tobacco, but none at all upon any of the Neighbours, except a few drops of the Skirt of the Shower. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> for that time went away, without returning to the Overseer again, till he heard of his Masters arrival at the <hi rend="italics">Falls,</hi> and then he came to him, and demanded the two Bottles of Rum. The Collonel at first seem'd to know nothing of the matter, and ask'd the <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> for what reason he made that demand? (altho his Overseer had been so overjoy'd at what had happen'd, that he could not rest till he had taken a Horse and rid near forty Miles to tell his Master the story.) The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> answer'd with some concern, that he hop'd the Overseer had let him know the service he had done him, by bringing a Shower of Rain to save his Crop. At this the Collonel, not being apt to believe such Stories, smil'd, and told him, he was a Cheat, and had seen the Cloud a coming, otherwise he could neither have brought the Rain, nor so much as foretold it. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> at this seeming much troubl'd, reply'd, Why then had not such a one, and such a one, (naming the next Neighbours) Rain as well as your Overseer, for they lost their Crops; but I lov'd you, and therefore I sav'd yours? The Collonel made sport with him a little while, but in the end order'd him the two Bottles of Rum, letting him understand however, that it was a free Gift, and not the consequence of any Bargain with his Overseer.</p>

                     <p>§. 32. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have their Altars and places of Sacrifice. Some say they now and then sacrifice young Children: but they deny it, and assure us, that when they withdraw these Children, it is not to Sacrifice them, but to Consecrate them to the service of their God. <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> tells of one of these Sacrifices in his time, from the Testimony of some
<pb n="38"/>
people, who had been Eye witnesses. His words are these.</p>
                     <p>“Fifteen of the properest young Boys between ten and fifteen years of Age they painted white, having brought them forth, the people spent the Forenoon in Dancing and Singing about them with Rattles. In the Afternoon they put these Children to the Root of a Tree. By them all the Men stood in a Guard, every one having a <hi rend="italics">Bastinado</hi> in his Hand, made of Reeds bound together; they made a Lane between them all along, through which there were appointed five Young Men to fetch these Children: So every one of the five went through the Guard, to fetch a Child each after other by turns; the Guard fiercely beating them with their <hi rend="italics">Bastinadoes,</hi> and they patiently enduring and receiving all, defending the Children with their naked Bodies from the unmerciful blows, that pay them soundly, though the Children escape. All this while the Women weep and cry out very passionately, providing Mats, Skins, Moss, and dry Wood, as things fitting for their Childrens Funeral. After the Children were thus past the Guard, the Guards tore down the Tree, Branches and Bows with such violence, that they rent the Body, made Wreaths for their Heads, and bedeck'd their Hair with the Leaves.</p>
                     <p>“What else was done with the Children was not seen, but they were all cast on a heap in a a Valley as dead, where they made a great Feast for all the Company.</p>
                     <p>“The <hi rend="italics">Werowance</hi> being demanded the meaning of this Sacrifice, answer'd, that the Children were not dead, but that the <hi rend="italics">Okee</hi> or Devil did suck the Blood from the Left Breast of those, who chanc'd to he his by lot, till they were dead, but the rest were kept in the Wilderness
<pb n="39"/>
by the young men, till nine months were expired, during which time they must not converse with any; and of these were made their Priests and Conjurers.<corr>”</corr>
                     </p>
                     <p>How far Captain <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi> might be misinform'd in this account, I can't say, or whether their <hi rend="italics">Okee</hi>'s sucking the Breast, be only a delusion or pretence of the Physician, (or Priest, who is always a Physician) to prevent all reflection on his skill, when any happen'd to dye under his discipline. This I choose rather to believe, than those Religious Romances concerning their <hi rend="italics">Okee.</hi> For I take this story of <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi>'s to be only an example of <hi rend="italics">Huskanawing,</hi> which being a Ceremony then altogether unknown to him, he might easily mistake some of the circumstances of it.</p>
                     <p>The Solemnity of <hi rend="italics">Huskanawing</hi> is commonly practis'd once every fourteen or sixteen years, or oftener, as their young men happen to grow up. It is an Institution or Discipline which all young men must pass, before they can be admitted to be of the number of the Great men, or <hi rend="italics">Cockarouses</hi> of the Nation; whereas by Captain <hi rend="italics">Smith</hi>'s Relation, they were only set apart to supply the Priesthood. The whole Ceremony is performed after the following manner.</p>
                     <p>The choicest and briskest young men of the Town, and such only as have acquired some Treasure by their Travels and Hunting, are chosen out by the Rulers to be <hi rend="italics">Huskanawed;</hi> and whoever refuses to undergo this Process, dare nor remain among them. Several of those odd preparatory Fopperies are premis'd in the beginning, which have been before related; but the principal part of the business is to carry them into the Woods, and there keep them under confinement, and destitute of all Society, for several months; giving them no other sustenance, but the Infusion, or Decoction
<pb n="40"/>
of some Poisonous Intoxicating Roots; by virtue of which Physick, and by the severity of the discipline, which they undergo, they become stark staring Mad: In which raving condition they are kept eighteen or twenty days. During these extremities, they are shut up, night and day, in a strong Inclosure made on purpose; one of which I saw, belonging to the <hi rend="italics">Paumaunkie Indians,</hi> in the year 1694. It was in shape like a Sugar-loaf, and every way open like a Lattice, for the Air to pass through, as in Tab. 4. Fig. 3. In this Cage thirteen young Men had been <hi rend="italics">Huskanaw'd,</hi> and had not been a month set at liberty, when I saw it. Upon this occasion it is pretended, that these poor Creatures drink so much of that Water of <hi rend="italics">Lethe,</hi> that they perfectly lose the remembrance of all former things, even of their Parents, their Treasure, and their Language. When the Doctors find that they have drank sufficiently of the <hi rend="italics">Wysoccan,</hi> (so they call this mad Potion) they gradually restore them to their Sences again, by lessening the Intoxication of their Diet; but before they are perfectly well, they bring them back into their Towns, while they are still wild and crazy, through the Violence of the Medicine. After this they are very fearful of discovering any thing of their former remembrance; for if such a thing should happen to any of them, they must immediately be <hi rend="italics">Haskanaw'd</hi> again; and the second time the usage is so severe, that seldom any one escapes with Life. Thus they must pretend to have forgot the very use of their Tongues, so as not to be able to speak, nor understand any thing that is spoken, till they learn it again. Now whether this be real or counterfeit, I don't know; but certain it is, that they will not for some time take notice of any body, nor any thing, with which they were before acquainted, being still under the guard of their
<pb n="41"/>
Keepers, who constantly wait upon them every where, till they have learnt all things perfectly over again. Thus they unlive their former lives, and commence Men, by forgetting that they ever have been Boys. If under this Exercise any one should dye, I suppose the Story of <hi rend="italics">Okee,</hi> mention'd by <hi rend="italics">Smith,</hi> is the Salvo for it: For (says he) <hi rend="italics">Okee</hi> was to have such as were his by lot; and such were said to be Sacrificed.</p>
                     <p>Now this Conjecture is the more probable, because we know that <hi rend="italics">Okee</hi> has not a share in every <hi rend="italics">Huskanawing;</hi> for tho two young men happen'd to come short home, in that of the <hi rend="italics">Pamaunkie Indians,</hi> which was perform'd in the year 1694, yet the <hi rend="italics">Appamattucks,</hi> formerly a great Nation, tho now an inconsiderable people, made an <hi rend="italics">Huskanaw</hi> in the year 1690, and brought home the same number they carried out.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <p>§. 33. I can account no other way for the great pains and secrecy of the Keepers, during the whole process of this discipline, but by assuring you, that it is the most meritorious thing in the World, to discharge that trust well, in order to their preferment to the greatest posts in the Nation, which they claim as their undoubted right, in the next promotion. On the other hand, they are sure of a speedy Passport into the other World, if they should by their Levity or Neglect, show themselves in the least unfaithful.</p>
                     <p>Those which I ever observ'd to have been <hi rend="italics">Huskanawed,</hi> were lively handsome well timber'd young men, from fifteen to twenty years of age or upward, and such as were generally reputed rich.</p>
                     <p>I confess, I judged it at first sight to be only an Invention of the Seniors, to engross the young mens Riches to themselves; for, after suffering this operation, they never pretended to call to mind
<pb n="42"/>
any thing of their former property: But their Goods were either shared among the old men, or brought to some publick use; and so those Younkers were oblig'd to begin the World again.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> detest this opinion, and pretend that this violent method of taking away the Memory, is to release the Youth from all their Childish impressions, and from that strong Partiality to persons and things, which is contracted before Reason comes to take place. They hope by this proceeding, to root out all the prepossessions and unreasonable prejudices which are fixt in the minds of Children. So that, when the Young men come to themselves again, their Reason may act freely, without being byass'd by the Cheats of Custom and Education. Thus also they become discharg'd from the remembrance of any tyes by Blood, and are establisht in a state of equality and perfect freedom, to order their actions, and dispose of their persons, as they think fit, without any other Controul, than that of the Law of Nature. By this means also they become qualify'd, when they have any Publick Office, equally and impartially to administer Justice, without having respect either to Friend or Relation.</p>

                     <p>§. 34. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> offer Sacrifice almost upon every new occasion; as when they travel or begin a long Journey, they burn Tobacco instead of Incense, to the Sun, to bribe him to send them fair Weather, and a prosperous Voyage: When they cross any great Water, or violent Fresh, or Torrent, they throw Tobacco, Puccoon, Peak, or some other valuable thing, that they happen to have about there, to intreat the Spirit presiding there, to grant them a safe passage. It is call'd a Fresh, when after very great Rains, or (as we suppose) after a great Thaw of the Snow and Ice lying upon the Mountains
<pb n="43"/>
to the North West, the Water descends, in such abundance into the Rivers, that they overflow the Banks which bound their Streams at other times.</p>
                     <p>Likewise when the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> return from War, from Hunting, from great Journeys, or the like, they offer some proportion of their Spoils, of their chiefest Tobacco, Furs and Paint, as also the fat, and choice bits of their Game.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 35. I never could learn that they had any certain time or set days for their Solemnities: but they have appointed Feasts that happen according to the several Seasons. They solemnize a day for the plentiful coming of their Wild Fowl, such as Geese, Ducks, Teal, &amp;<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> for the returns of their Hunting Seasons, and for the ripening of certain Fruits: but the greatest Annual Feast they have, is at the time of their Corn-gathering, at which they revel several days together. To these they universally contribute, as they do to the gathering in the Corn. On this occasion they have their greatest variety of Pastimes, and more especially of their War-Dances, and Heroick Songs; in which they boast, that their Corn being now gather'd, they have store enough for their Women and Children; and have nothing to do, but to go to War, Travel, and to seek out for New Adventures.</p>

                     <p>§. 36. They make their Account by units, tens, hundreds, &amp;<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> as we do; but they reckon the Years by the Winters, or <hi rend="italics">Cohonks,</hi> as they call them; which is a name taken from the note of the Wild Geese, intimating so many times of the Wild Geese coming to them, which is every Winter. They distinguish the several parts of the Year, by five Seasons, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> The budding or blossoming of the
<pb n="44"/>
Spring; the earing of the Corn, or roasting ear time; the Summer, or highest Sun; the Corn-gathering, or fall of the Leaf; and the Winter, or <hi rend="italics">Cobonks.</hi> They count the Months likewise by the Moons, tho not with any relation to so many in a year, as we do: but they make them return again by the same name, as the Moon of Stags, the Corn Moon, the first and second Moon of <hi rend="italics">Cobonks, &amp; c.</hi> They have no distinction of the hours of the Day, but divide it only into three parts, the Rise, Power, and lowering of the Sun. And they keep their account by knots on a string, or notches on a Stick, not unlike the <hi rend="italics">Peruvian Quippoes.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>§. 37. In this state of Nature, one would think they should be as pure from Superstition, and overdoing matters in Religion, as they are in other things: but I find it is quite the contrary; for this Simplicity gives the cunning Priest a greater advantage over them, according to the <hi rend="italics">Romish</hi> Maxim, <hi rend="italics">Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion.</hi> For, no bigotted Pilgrim appears more zealous, or strains his Devotion more at the Shrine, than these believing <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> do, in their Idolatrous Adorations. Neither do the most refin'd Catholicks undergo their pennance with so much submission as these poor Pagans do the severities, which their Priests inflict upon them.</p>
                     <p>They have likewise in other cases many fond and idle Superstitions, as for the purpose, by the falls of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River upon Collonel <hi rend="italics">Byrd's</hi> Land, there lies a Rock which I have seen, about a mile from the River, wherein is fairly imprest several marks like the footsteps of a Gigantick Man, each step being about five foot asunder: These they aver to be the track of their God.</p>
                     <p>This is not unlike what the Fathers of the <hi rend="italics">Romish</hi> Church tell us, that our Lord left the print
<pb n="45"/>
of his Feet on the Stone, whereon he stood while he talkt with St <hi rend="italics">Peter;</hi> which Stone was afterward preserv'd as a very Sacred Relique, and after several translations, was at last fix'd in the Church of <hi rend="italics">St Sebastian</hi> the Martyr, where it is kept, and visited with great expressions of Devotion. So that the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as well as these, are not without their pious frauds.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 38. As this people have a great reverence for the Priest, so the Priest very oddly endeavours to preserve their respect, by being as hideously ugly as he can, especially when he appears in publick; for besides, that the cut of his Hair is peculiar to his Function, as in Tab. 4. Pag. 6. and the hanging of his Cloak, with the Fur reverst and falling down in flakes, looks horridly shagged, he likewise bedaubs himself in that frightful manner with Paint, that he terrifies the people into a veneration for him.</p>
                     <p>The Conjurer is a Partner with the Priest, not only in the Cheat, but in the advantages of it, and sometimes they officiate for one another. When this Artist is in the Act of Conjuration, or of <hi rend="italics">Pauwawing,</hi> as they term it, he always appears with an air of Haste, or else in some Convulsive posture, that seems to strain all the faculties, like the <hi rend="italics">Sybils,</hi> when they pretended to be under the Power of Inspiration. At these times, he has a black Bird with expanded Wings fasten'd to his Ear, differing in nothing but colour, from <hi rend="italics">Mahomet</hi>'s Pidgeon. He has no cloathing but a small skin before, and a Pocket at his Girdle, as in Tab. 4. Pag. 6.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> never go about any considerable Enterprize, without first consulting their Priests and Conjurers; for the most ingenious amongst them are brought up to those functions, and by that means become better instructed in their Histories,
<pb n="46"/>
than the rest of the people. They likewise engross to themselves all the knowledge of Nature, which is handed to them by Tradition from their Forefathers; by which means they are able to make a truer judgment of things, and consequently are more capable of advising those that consult them upon all occasions. These Reverend Gentlemen are not so entirely given up to their Religious Austerities, but they sometimes take their pleasure (as well as the Laity) in Fishing, Fowling and Hunting.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 39. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have Posts fix'd round their <hi rend="italics">Quioccasan,</hi> which have Mens Faces carved upon them, and are painted. They are likewise set up round some of their other celebrated places, and make a Circle for them to dance about, on certain solemn occasions. They very often set up Pyramidical Stones, and Pillars, which they colour with <hi rend="italics">Puccoon,</hi> and other sorts of Paint, and which they adorn with <hi rend="italics">Peak, Roenoke, &amp; c.</hi> To these they pay all outward signs of Worship and Devotion; not as to God, but as they are Hieroglyphicks of the permanency and immutability of the Deity; because these, both for figure and substance, are, of all Sublunary Bodies, the least subject to decay or change; they also for the same reason keep Baskets of Stones in their Cabbins. Upon this account too, they offer Sacrifice to Running Streams, which by the perpetuity of their Motion, typifie the Eternity of God.</p>
                     <p>They erect Altars where-ever they have any remarkable occasion; and because their principal Devotion consists in Sacrifice, they have a profound respect for these Altars. They have one particular Altar, to which, for some mystical reason, many of their Nations pay an extraordinary Veneration; of this sort was the Crystal Cube, mention'd Book
<pb n="47"/>
II. Chap. 3. §. 8. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> call this by the name of <hi rend="italics">Pawcorance,</hi> from whence proceeds the great Reverence they have for a small Bird that uses the Woods, and in their note continually sound that name. This Bird flys alone, and is only heard in the twilight. They say this is the Soul of one of their Princes; and on that score, they wou'd not hurt it for the World. But there was once a profane <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> in the upper parts of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, who, after abundance of fears and scruples, was at last brib'd to kill one of them with his Gun; but the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> say he paid dear for his presumption, for in few days after he was taken away, and never more heard of.</p>
                     <p>When they travel by any of these Altars, they take great care to instruct their Children and Young people in the particular occasion and time of their erection, and recommend the respect which they ought to have for them; so that their careful observance of these Traditions, proves as good a Memorial of such Antiquities, as any Written Records; especially for so long as the same people continue to inhabit in, or near the same place.</p>
                     <p>I can't understand that their Women ever pretended to intermeddle with any Offices, that relate to the Priesthood, or Conjuration.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 40. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are Religious in preserving the Corpses of their Kings and Rulers after Death, which they order in the following manner. First, they neatly flay off the Skin as entire as they can, slitting it only in the Back; then they pick all the Flesh off from the Bones as clean as possible, leaving the Sinews fastned to the Bones, that they may preserve the Joynts together; then they dry the Bones a little in the Sun, and put them into
<pb n="48"/>
the Skin again, which in the mean time has been kept from drying or shrinking; when the Bones are placed right in the Skin, they nicely fill up the vacuities, with a very fine white Sand. After this they sew up the Skin again, and the Body looks as if the Flesh had not been removed. They take care to keep the Skin from shrinking, by the help of a little Oyl or Grease, which saves it also from Corruption. The Skin being thus prepar'd, they lay it in an Apartment for that purpose, upon a large Shelf rais'd above the Floor. This Shelf is spread with Mats, for the Corps to rest easie on, and skreen'd with the same, to keep it from the Dust. The Flesh they lay upon Hurdles in the Sun to dry, and when it is throughly dryed, it is sewed up in a Basket, and set at the Feet of the Corps, to which it belongs. In this place also they set up a <hi rend="italics">Quioccos,</hi> or Idol, which they believe will be a Guard to the Corps.

                     <p>§. 41. THE <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are not subject to many Diseases, and such as they have, generally come from excessive Heats, and sudden Colds, which they as suddenly get away by Sweating. But if the Humour happen to fix, and make a pain in any particular Joynt, or Limb, their general cure then is by burning, if it be in any part that will bear it; their method of doing this, is by little Sticks of Light-wood, the Coal of which will burn like a hot Iron; the sharp point of this they run into the Flesh, and having made a Sore, keep it running till the Humour be drawn off: Or else they take Punck, (which is a sort of a sort Touchwood, cut out of the knots of Oak or Hiccory Trees, but the Hiccory affords the best,) this they shape like a Cone, (as the <hi rend="italics">Japoneses</hi> do their <hi rend="italics">Moxa</hi> for the Gout) and apply the Basis of it to the place affected. Then they set fire to it, letting it burn out upon the part, which makes a running Sore effectually.</p>
                     <p>They use Smoaking frequently and Scarrifying, which, like the <hi rend="italics">Mexicans,</hi> they perform with a Rattle-Snakes Tooth. They seldom cut deeper than the <hi rend="italics">Epidermis,</hi> by which means they give passage to those sharp waterish Humours, that lye between the two Skins, and cause Inflamations. Sometimes they make use of Reeds for Cauterizeing, which they heat over the Fire, till they are ready to flame, and then apply them upon a piece of thin wet Leather, to the place aggriev'd,
<pb n="50"/>
which makes the Heat more pierceing.</p>
                     <p>Their Priests are always Physicians, and by the method of their Education in the Priesthood, are made very knowing in the hidden qualities of Plants, and other Natural things, which they count a part of their Religion to conceal from every body, but from those that are to succeed them in their holy Function. They tell us, their God will be angry with them, if they should discover that part of their knowledge; so they suffer only the Rattle Snake Root to be known, and such other Antidotes, as must be immediately apply'd, because their Doctors can't be always at hand to remedy those sudden misfortunes, which generally happen in their Hunting or Travelling.</p>
                     <p>They call their Physick <hi rend="italics">Wisoccan,</hi> not from the name of any particular Root or Plant, but as it signifies Medicine in general. So that <hi rend="italics">Heriot, De Bry, Smith, Purchass</hi> and <hi rend="italics">De Laet,</hi> seem all to be mistaken in the meaning of this word <hi rend="italics">Wighsacan,</hi> which they make to be the name of a particular Root: And so is <hi rend="italics">Parkinson</hi> in the word <hi rend="italics">Woghsacan,</hi> which he will have to be the name of a Plant. Nor do I think there is better authority for applying the word <hi rend="italics">Wisank</hi> to the Plant <hi rend="italics">Vincetoxicum Indianum Germanicum,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Winank</hi> to the <hi rend="italics">Sassafrass</hi> Tree.</p>
                     <p>The Physick of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> consists for the most part, in the Roots and Barks of Trees, they very rarely using the Leaves either of Herbs or Trees; what they give inwardly, they infuse in Water, and what they apply outwardly, they stamp or bruise, adding Water to it, if it has not moisture enough of it self; with the thin of this they bathe the part affected, then lay on the thick, after the manner of a Pultis, and commonly dress round, leaving the sore place bare.</p>

                     <p>§. 42. They take great delight in Sweating, and therefore in every Town they have a Sweating-House, and a Doctor is paid by the Publick to attend it. They commonly use this to refresh themselves, after they have been fatigu'd with Hunting, Travel, or the like, or else when they are troubl'd with Agues, Aches, or Pains in their Limbs. Their method is thus, the Doctor takes three or four large Stones, which after having heated red hot, he places 'em in the middle of the Stove, laying on them some of the inner Bark of Oak beaten in a Mortar, to keep them from burning. This being done, they creep in six or eight at a time, or as many as the place will hold, and then close up the mouth of the Stove, which is usually made like an Oven, in some Bank near the Water side. In the mean while, the Doctor, to raise a Steam, after they have been stewing a little while, pours cold Water on the Stones, and now and then sprinkles the Men to keep them from fainting. After they have sweat as long as they can well endure it, they sally out, and (tho it be in the depth of Winter) forthwith plunge themselves over Head and Ears in cold Water, which instantly closes up the Pores, and preserves them from taking cold. The heat being thus suddenly driven from the extream parts to the Heart, makes them a little feeble for the present, but their Spirits rally again, and they instantly recover their Strength, and find their Joynts as supple and vigorous as if they never had travell'd, or been indispos'd. So that I may say as <hi rend="italics">Bellonius</hi> does in his Observations on the <hi rend="italics">Turkish</hi> Bagnio's, All the Crudities contracted in their Bodies, are by this means evaporated and carry'd off. The <hi rend="italics">Muscovites</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Finlanders</hi> are said to use this way of Sweating also. “It is almost a Miracle,
<pb n="52"/>
says <hi rend="italics">Olearius,</hi> to see how their Bodies, accustom'd to, and harden'd by Cold, can endure so intense a Heat, and how that when they are not able to endure it longer, they come out of the Stoves as naked as they were born, both Men and Women, and plunge into cold Water, or cause it to be pour'd on them.<corr>”</corr>

                     <p>The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> also pulverize the Roots of a kind of <hi rend="italics">Anchuse</hi> or yellow <hi rend="italics">Alkanet,</hi> which they call <hi rend="italics">Puccoon,</hi> and of a sort of wild <hi rend="italics">Angelica,</hi> and mixing them together with Bears Oyl, make a yellow Ointment, with which, after they have bath'd, they anoint themselves Capapee; this supples the Skin, renders them nimble and active, and withal so closes up the Pores, that they lose but few of their Spirits by Perspiration. <hi rend="italics">Piso</hi> relates the same of the <hi rend="italics">Brasilians,</hi> and my Lord <hi rend="italics">Bacon</hi> asserts, that Oyl and fat things do no less conserve the substance of the Body, than Oyl colours, and Varnish do that of the Wood.</p>
                     <p>They have also a a further advantage of this Oyntment, for it keeps all Lice, Fleas, and other troublesome Vermine from coming near them; which otherwise, by reason of the nastiness of their Cabbins, they would be very much infested with.</p>

THEIR Sports and Pastimes are Singing, Dancing, Instrumental Musick, and some boisterous Plays, which are perform'd by Running, Catching and Leaping upon one another; they have also one great Diversion, to the practising of which, are requisite whole handfuls of Sticks or hard Straws, which they know how to count as fast, as they can cast their Eyes upon them, and can handle with a surprizing dexterity.</p>
                     <p>Their Singing is not the most charming that I have heard, it consists much in exalting the voice, and is full of slow melancholy accents. However, I must allow even this Musick to contain some wild Notes that are agreeable.</p>
                     <p>Their Dancing is perform'd either by few or a great Company, but without much regard either to Time or Figure. The first of these is by one or two persons, or at most by three. In the mean while, the Company sit about them in a Ring upon the Ground, singing outrageously and shaking their Rattles. The Dancers sometimes Sing, and sometimes look menacing and terrible, beating their Feet furiously against the Ground, and showing ten thousand Grimaces and Distortions. The other is perform'd by a great number of people, the Dancers themselves forming a Ring, and moving round a Circle of carv'd Posts, that are set up for that purpose; or else round a Fire, made in a convenient part of the Town; and then each has his Rattle in his hand, or what other thing he

fancies most, as his Bow and Arrows, or his <hi rend="italics">Tomahawk.</hi> They also dress themselves up with Branches of Trees, or some other strange accoutrements. Thus they proceed, Dancing and Singing, with all the antick postures they can invent; and he's the bravest Fellow that has the most prodigious gestures.

These Fiends, with most Hellish Shouts and Cries, rushing from among the Trees, cast themselves in a Ring about the Fire, Singing and Dancing with most excellent ill variety, oft falling into their infernal passions, and then solemnly betaking themselves again to Sing and Dance; having spent near an hour in this <hi rend="italics">Mascarado,</hi> as they enter'd, in like manner they departed.<corr>”</corr>

Nature and their own convenience having taught them to obey one Chief, who is Arbiter of all things among them. They claim no property in Lands, but they are in Common to a whole Nation. Every one Hunts and Fishes, and gathers Fruits in all places. Their labour in tending Corn, Pompions, Melons, &amp; <hi rend="italics">c.</hi> is not so great, that they need quarrel for room, where the Land is so fertile, and where so much lyes uncultivated.</p>
                     <p>They bred no sort of Cattle, nor had any thing that could be call'd Riches. They valued Skins and Furs for use, and <hi rend="italics">Peak</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Roenoke</hi> for ornament.</p>
                     <p>They are very severe in punishing ill breeding, of which every <hi rend="italics">Werowance</hi> is undisputed Judge, who never fails to lay a rigorous penalty upon it. An example whereof I had from a Gentleman that was an eyewitness; which was this.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi rend="italics">Bacon'</hi>s Rebellion, one of these <hi rend="italics">Werowances,</hi> attended by several others of his Nation, was treating with the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> in <hi rend="italics">New Kent</hi> County, about a Peace; and during the time of his Speech, one of his Attendants presum'd to interrupt him, which he resented as the most unpardonable affront that cou'd be offer'd him;

BEfore I finish my account of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> it will not be amiss to inform you, that when the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> went first among them, they had no sort of Iron or Steel Instruments: but their Knives were either Sharpen'd Reeds, or Shells, and their Axes sharp Stones bound to the end of a Stick, and glued in with Turpentine. By the help of these, they made their Bows of the Locust Tree, an excessive hard Wood when it is dry, but much more easily cut when it is green, of which they always took the advantage. They made their Arrows of Reeds or small Wands, which needed no other cutting, but in the length, being otherwise ready for Notching, Feathering and Heading. They fledged their Arrows with Turkey Feathers, which they fastned with Glue made of the Velvet Horns of a Deer, but it has not that quality it's said to have, of holding against all Weathers; they arm'd the Heads with a white transparent Stone, like that of <hi rend="italics">Mexico</hi> mention'd by <hi rend="italics">Peter Martyr,</hi> of which they have many Rocks; they also headed them with the Spurs of the Wild Turkey Cock.</p>
                     <p>They rubb'd Fire out of particular sorts of Wood (as the Antients did out of the Ivy and Bays) by turning the end of a hard piece upon the side of a piece that is soft and dry, like a Spindle on its Inke, by which it heats, and at length burns; to
<pb n="61"/>
this they put sometimes also rotten Wood, and dry Leaves to hasten the Work.</p>
                  </div>

                     <p>§. 48. Under the disadvantage of such Tools they made a shift to fell vast great Trees, and clear the Land of Wood, in places where they had occasion.</p>
                     <p>They bring down a great Tree, by making a small Fire round the Root, and keeping the Flame from running upward, until they burn away so much of the basis, that the least puff of Wind throws it down. When it is prostrate, they burn it off to what length they would have it, and with their Stone <hi rend="italics">Tomahawks</hi> break off all the Bark, which when the Sap runs, will easily strip, and at other times also, if it be well warm'd with Fire. When it is brought to a due length, they raise it upon a Bed to a convenient height for their working, and then begin by gentle Fires to hollow it, and with scrapers rake the Trunk, and turn away the Fire from one place to another, till they have deepen'd the Belly of it to their desire: Thus also they shape the ends, till they have made it a fit Vessel for crossing the Water, and this they call a Canoe, one of which I have seen thirty foot long.</p>
                     <p>When they wanted any Land to be clear'd of the Woods, they chopp'd a Notch round the Trees quite through the Bark with their Stone Hatchets, or <hi rend="italics">Tomahawks,</hi> and that deaden'd the Trees, so that they sprouted no more, but in a few years fell down. However, the Ground was plantable, and would produce immediately upon the withering of the Trees: but now for all these uses they employ Axes, and little Hatchets, which they buy of the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi> The occasions aforemention'd, and the building of their Cabbins, are still the greatest
<pb n="62"/>
use they have for these Utensils, because they trouble not themselves with any other sort of Handicraft, to which such Tools are necessary. Their Houshold Utensils are Baskets made of Silk grass, Gourds, which grow to the shapes they desire them, and Earthen Pots to boil Victuals in, which they make of Clay.</p>

                        <p>§ 1. I Have already hinted, that the first Settlement of this Country, was under the direction of a Company of Merchants incorporated.</p>
                        <p>That the first Constitution of Government appointed by them, was by a President and Council, which Council was nominated by the Corporation, and the President annually chosen by the People.</p>
                        <pb n="2"/>
                        <p>That in the year 1610 this Constitution was altered, and the Company obtain'd a new Grant of his Majesty; whereby they themselves had the nomination of the Governor, who was oblig'd to act only by advice in Council.</p>
                        <p>That in the year 1620, an Assembly of Burgesses was first call'd, from all the inhabited parts of the Country, who sat in consultation with the Governor and Council, for setling the Publick Affairs of the Plantation; and so the form of Government became perfect.</p>
                        <p>That when the Company was dissolv'd, the King continued the same method of Government, by a Governour, Council, and Burgesses; which three being united, were call'd the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>That this General Assembly debated all the weighty Affairs of the Colony, and enacted Laws for the better government of the People; and the Governor and Council were to put them in execution.</p>
                        <p>That the Governor and Council were appointed by the King, and the Assembly chosen by the People.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards the Governor had a more extensive Power put into his hands, so that his Assent in all affairs became absolutely necessary; yet was he still bound to act by Advice of Council.</p>
                        <p>Until the Rebellion 1676, the Governor had no power to suspend the Councellors, nor to remove any of them from the Council-Board.</p>
                        <p>Then a power was given him of Suspending them, but with Proviso, that he gave substantial Reasons for so doing; and was answerable to his Majesty for the truth of the Accusation.</p>
                        <p>Then also this Model of Government by a Governor, Council and Assembly, was confirm'd
<pb n="3"/>
to them Charter, with a further Clause, That if the Governor should happen to die, or be removed, and no other Person in the Country nominated by the Crown to supply his Place; then the President, or eldest Councellor, with the assistance of any five of the Council, should take upon him the Administration of the Government.</p>
                        <p>Before the year 1680, the Council sat in the same House with the Burgesses of Assembly, much resembling the Model of the <hi rend="italics">Scots</hi> Parliament; and then the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper</hi> taking advantage of some Disputes among them, procur'd the Council to sit apart from the Assembly; and so they became two distinct Houses, in imitation of the two Houses of Parliament in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> the Lords and Commons; and so is the Constitution at this day.</p>

                        <p>The Governors Salary till within these thirty years last past, was no more than a Thousand pounds a year; besides which he had about five hundred more in Perquisites: Indeed, the General Assembly by a publick Act, made an Addition of two hundred pounds a year to Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkeley</hi> in particular, out of the great Respect and Esteem they bore to that Gentleman, who had been a long time a good and just Governor; and who had laid out the greatest part of his Revenue in Experiments, for the Advantage and Improvement of the Country; and who had besides suffered extremely in the time of the Usurpation. But this Addition was to determine with his Government.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi rend="italics">William Berkley</hi> after the short Interval of <hi rend="italics">Jeffery</hi>'s and <hi rend="italics">Chichley</hi>'s being Deputy-Governors, was succeeded by the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper;</hi> who under pretence of his being a Peer of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> obtain'd of King <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> II. a Salary of 2000 <hi rend="italics">l.</hi> besides 150 <hi rend="italics">l.</hi> a year for House-Rent, because there was no House appointed by the Country for the Governors Reception.</p>
                        <pb n="5"/>
                        <p>This Noble Lord made his advantage of the confusions, in which he found the Country, that had not recover'd the Calamities of <hi rend="italics">Bacons</hi> Rebellion. He observ'd, that abundance of People had been concern'd in those Troubles; and consequently, he concluded they wou'd not scruple to grant him any thing, to protect themselves from Prosecution. By this means he not only obtain'd the Concurrence of the Assembly to his Money-Grants, but likewise prevail'd with them to make the Imposition of two Shillings <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Hogshead, and the Fort-Duties perpetual; and to make them subject to his Majesties direction, to be disposed of for the use of the Government. This increas'd Salary has been continued ever since, to all the succeeding Governors, and the Perquisites are now also increased.</p>
                        <p>If the Administration of the Government happen to fall into the hands of the President and Council, there is then usually allow'd to the President, the Addition of five hundred pounds a year only; and to the Council, no more than what is given them at other times.</p>

They are conven'd by Writs issued from the Secretaries Office, under the Seal of the Colony, and the Test of the Governor. These are directed to the Sheriff of each County respectively, and ought to bear date at least forty days before the return. The Freeholders are the only Electors, and where-ever they have a Free-hold, (if they be not Women, or under
<pb n="7"/>
Age) they have a Vote in the Election. The Method of summoning the Free-holders, is by publication of the Writ, together with the day appointed by the Sheriff for Election, at every Church and Chappel in the County, two several Sundays successively. The Election is concluded by plurality of Voices; and if either Party be dissatisfied, or thinks he has not fair Treatment, he may demand a Copy of the Poll, and upon Application to the House of Burgesses shall have his Complaint inquired into. But to prevent undue Elections, many Acts have been there made agreeable to some lately enacted in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>

                        <p>The first business of a Convention, is to make choice of a Speaker, and to present him in full House to the Governor. Upon this occasion the Speaker in the name of the House, petitions the Governor to confirm the usual Liberties, and Priviledges of Assembly, namely, Access to his Person, whenever they shall have occasion; a freedom of Speech, and Debate in the House, without being further accountable; and a Protection of their Persons and their Servants from Arrest, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> And these being granted by the Governor, they proceed to do Business, choosing Committees, and in other things, imitating as near as they can, the Method of the Honourable House of Commons in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>

them, although she be not pleased to declare her Royal Assent.</p>
                        <p>There are no appointed times for their Convention, but the Custom hitherto has been once in a year, or once in two years; and indeed, seldom two intire years pass without an Assembly; They wisely keeping the power that is left them, in their own Hands, by the short continuation of the Imposition Acts. They are call'd together, whenever the Exigencies of the Country make it necessary, or her Majesty is pleas'd to order any thing to be proposed to them.</p>

                        <p>The Method of bounding the Counties is at this time, with respect to the Convenience of having each County limited to one single River, for its Trade and Shipping: So that any one whose Concerns are altogether in one County, may not be obliged to seek his Freight and Shipping in more than one River. Whereas at first, they were bounded with respect to the Circuit, and the Propinquity of the extreams to one common Center; by which means, one County reached then quite a-cross a neck of Land from River to River. But this way of bounding the Counties being found
<pb n="9"/>
more inconvenient than the other, it was changed by a Law, into what it is now.</p>
                        <p>Besides this Division into Counties, and Parishes, there are two other Sub-divisions, which are subject to the Rules and Alterations made by the County-Courts; namely, into Precincts or Burroughs, for the limits of Constables; and into Precincts or Walks, for the Surveyors of Highways.</p>

                        <p>The Auditors business is to audite the Accounts of the publick Money of the Government, and duly to transmit the state of them to <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> such as the Quit-Rents, the Money arising by the two Shillings <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Hogshead, Fort-Duties, the Fines and Forfeitures, and the Profits of Escheats. His Salary is 7 ½ <hi rend="italics">per Cent,</hi> of all the publick Money.</p>
                        <p>The Secretaries business is to keep the publick Records of the Country, and to take care that they be regularly and fairly made up; namely, all Judgments of the General Court, as likewise all Deeds, and other Writings there proved; and further, to issue all. Writs, both Ministerial, and Judicial relating thereto. To make out and record all Patents for Land, to file the Rights by which they issued, and to take the return of all Inquests of Escheat.</p>
                        <p>In his Office is kept a Register of all Commissions of Administration, and Probates of Wills,
<pb n="11"/>
granted throughout the Colony; as also of all Births, Burials, Marriages, and Persons that go out of the Country: Of all Houses of publick Entertainment, and of all publick Officers in the Country; and of many other things, proper to be kept in so general an Office.</p>
                        <p>From this Office are likewise issued all Writs for choosing of Burgesses, and in it are fil'd Authentick Copies of all Proclamations.</p>
                        <p>This Office was reduc'd into very good Order, after the burning of the State House at <hi rend="italics">James</hi> Town; but for want of Conveniences, and due Care, it is growing a-pace into as great confusion as ever.</p>
                        <p>The Secretaries Income arises from Fees for all business done in his Office, which come <hi rend="italics">(Communibus annis)</hi> to about 70,000 <hi rend="italics">l.</hi> Tobacco <hi rend="italics">per Annum;</hi> out of which he pays 12500 and Cask to the Clerks: His other Perquisites proceed out of the acknowledgments pay'd him annually by the County Clerks, and are besides about forty thousand pounds a year of Tobacco, and Cask.</p>

The Ecclesiastical Commissary, authorised by the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of <hi rend="italics">London,</hi> Ordinary of all the Plantations: 2<hi rend="italics">ly.</hi> The Countries Treasurer, authorised by the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Commissaries business is to make Visitations of Churches, and have the Inspection of the Clergy. He is allowed 100 <hi rend="italics">l. per Ann.</hi> out of the Quitrents.</p>
                        <p>The Treasurers business is to receive the Money

from the several Collectors, and to make up the Accounts, of the Duties rais'd by some late Acts of Assembly, for extraordinary Occasions; his Salary is six <hi rend="italics">per Cent.</hi> of all Money passing through his Hands.</p>
                        <p>These are all the General Officers belonging to that Government, except of the Court of Admiralty, which has no standing Officer.</p>

                        <p>§. 10 The other publick Commission-Officers in the Government, (except those of the Militia, for whom a Chapter is reserved) are Escheators, Naval Officers, Collectors, Clerks of Courts, Sheriffs of Counties, Surveyors of Land, and Coroners.</p>
                        <p>The Escheators have their Precincts or Bounds, according to the several Necks of Land; for their Profits, they demand five Pound Sterling for each Office found, being paid only as business happens.</p>
                        <p>The Naval Officers have their bounds according to the Districts on the Rivers, and so have the Collectors. The Profits of the first arise from large Fees, upon the entering and clearing of all Ships and Vessels. The Collectors have each a Salary out of the Treasury in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> of Forty pounds, Sixty pounds, or an Hundred pounds, according to their several Districts, they being appointed by the Honourable the Commissioners of the Customs in <hi rend="italics">Eng.</hi> Pursuant to a Statute made in the 25<hi rend="italics">th</hi> year of King <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi> the Second; and have moreover Salaries of 20 <hi rend="italics">per Cent.</hi> on all the Duties they collect, by virtue of the same Statute, and also large Fees for every Entry and Clearing.</p>
                        <p>The Naval Officers other Profits, are ten <hi rend="italics">per Cent.</hi> for all Money's by them receiv'd; both on the two Shillings <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Hogshead, Fort-Duties, Skins and Furs, and also on the new Imposts on Servants and Liquors.</p>

                        <p>The Clerks of Courts, Sheriffs, and Surveyors, are limited according to the several Counties. The Clerks of Courts receive their Commissions from the Secretary of State; the Sheriffs theirs from the Governor, and the Surveyors of Land, theirs from the Governors of the Colledge, in whom the Office of Surveyor-General is vested by their Charter.</p>
                        <p>The Clerks Profits proceed from stated Fees, upon all Law-suits and business in their respective Courts, except the Clerk of the General Court, who is paid a Salary by the Secretary, who takes the Fees of that Court to himself. The large and populous Counties by these Fees allow a plentiful Maintenance to their Clerks; the Clerks at present exact what Fees they will, having none allow'd them by Law, because of the expiration of the Acts relating thereto.</p>
                        <p>The Sheriffs Profit is likewise by Fees on all business done in the County-Courts, to which he is the Ministerial Officer; but the best of his Income is by a Salary of 10 <hi rend="italics">per Cent.</hi> on all his Collections; he has likewise several other Advantages, which make his place very profitable.</p>
                        <p>The Profits of the Surveyors of Land are according to the trouble they take: But because Men of Honour and Understanding, should be incouraged to undertake this Office, on whose Probity and Skill, the title and quiet of Estates depend, it were to be wisht, that these Officers were allow'd larger Fees.</p>
                        <p>The Coroner is a Commission-Officer also, but his Profits are not worth naming, though he has large Fees allowed him, when he does any Business. There are two or more of them appointed in each Parish, as occasion requires; but in the vacancy, or absence of any, upon an Exigency, the next Justice of Peace does the Business,
<pb n="14"/>
and receives the Fee, which is 133 Pounds of Tobacco for an Inquest, and nothing for any other Business.</p>

Person in the Country, upon all alike, without distinction.</p>
                        <p>They call all Negroes above sixteen years of Age Tithable, be they Male or Female; and all white Men of the same Age. But Children and white Women, are exempted from all manner of Duties.</p>

These serve to defray several expences appointed by Law, to be so defrayed; such as the executing of a Criminal Slave, who must be made good to his Owner. The taking up of Run-aways, and the paying of the Militia, when they happen to be imployed upon Service. Out of these they likewise pay the several Officers of the Assembly, and some other Publick Officers.

                        <p>§. 22. I Have already in the Chronology of the Government, hinted what the Constitution of their Courts was in old time, and that Appeals lay from the General Court to the Assembly. That the General Court from the beginning, took cognizance of all Causes whatsoever, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, determining every thing by the Standard of Equity and good Conscience. They us'd to come to the merits of the cause, as soon as they could without Injustice, never admitting such impertinences of Form and Nicety, as were not absolutely necessary: and when the substance of the case was sufficiently debated, they us'd directly to bring the Suit to a Decision. By this Method all fair Actions were prosecuted with little Attendance,
<pb n="20"/>
all just Debts were recover'd with the least expence of Money and Time; and all the tricking, and foppery of the Law happily avoided.</p>
                        <p>The Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper,</hi> who was a Man of admirable Sense, and well Skilled in the Laws of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> admired the constitution of their Courts, and kept them close to this plain Method, retrenching some Innovations, that were then creeping into them, under the notion of Form; although, at the same time, he was the occasion, of taking away the liberty of Appeals to the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>But the Lord <hi rend="italics">Howard</hi> who succeeded him, <hi rend="italics">(</hi>tho' he was himself a Man absolutely unskill'd in the legal proceedings of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi>
                           <hi rend="italics">)</hi> endeavour'd to introduce as many of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Forms as he could, being directly opposite to the Lord <hi rend="italics">Colepepper</hi> in that point.</p>
                        <p>After him Sir <hi rend="italics">Edmund Andros,</hi> when he was Governor, caused the Statutes of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> to be allowed for Law there; even such Statutes, as were made of late time, since the grant of the last Charter.</p>
                        <p>And Lastly, Governor <hi rend="italics">Nicholson,</hi> a Man unacquainted with all Law, except that of <hi rend="italics">Morocco,</hi> where he learnt the way of governing by force, has endeavour'd to introduce all the quirks of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Proceedings, by the help of some wretched Pettifoggers, who have had the direction both of his Conscience and his Understanding.</p>

                        <p>§. 23. They have two sorts of Courts, that differ only in Jurisdiction; namely, the General Court, and the County-Courts. I don't mention the Court of Admiralty, of which there is neither
<pb n="21"/>
Judge, nor any Salary appointed for him; and indeed, upon these terms, no Man of any Rank or Abilities, wou'd care to undertake such a troublesom Office. Neither is there the least occasion of any such charge, because their County-Courts sitting so frequently, have hitherto supplied their place; and upon extraordinary occasion of dispatch in Maritime Affairs, the first Justice in Commission is authorised by Law, to call Courts out of course, to determine them.</p>

                        <p>§. 24. The General Court, is a Court held by the Governour and Council, who by Custom, are the Judges of it, in all civil Disputes: but in all criminal Cases, they are made Judges by the Charter.</p>
                        <p>This Court, as it did from the beginning, so it does still, take cognizance of all Causes, Criminal, Penal, Ecclesiastical and Civil. From this Court there is no Appeal, except the thing in demand exceed the value of three hundred pounds Sterling; in which case, an Appeal is allowed to the Queen and Council in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and there determin'd by a Committee of the Privy Council, call'd the Lords of Appeals; the like Custom being used for all the other Plantations. In Criminal cases I don't know that there's any Appeal from the Sentence of this Court; but the Governor is authorised, to pardon Persons found guilty of any Crime whatsoever, except of Treason, and willful Murder; and even in those cases, he may reprieve the Criminal, if the Court represent him, to be an object of Mercy; which Reprieve stands good, and may be continued, until her Majesties pleasure be signified therein.</p>

                        <p>§. 25.

                        <p>§. 26. The Officers attending this Court, are the Sheriff of the County, wherein it sits, and his Under-Officers. Their business is to call the Litigants, and the Evidences into Court, and to impannel Juries: But each Sheriff in his respective County, makes Arrests, and returns the Writs to this Court.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>§. 27. The way of impanneling Juries to serve in this Court, is thus: The Sheriff and his Deputies every Morning that the Court sits, goes about the Town, summoning the best of the Gentlemen, who resort thither, from all parts of the Country. The Condition of this Summons is, that they attend the Court that day, to serve upon the Jury, (it not being known whether there will be occasion or no:) And if any cause happen to require a Jury, they are then sworn to try the issue, otherwise they are in the Evening of course, dismist from all further Attendance; though they be not formally discharged by the Court. By this means are procur'd the best Juries this Country can afford; for if they should be summon'd by Writ of <hi rend="italics">Venire,</hi> from any particular County, that County cannot afford so many qualify'd Persons as are here to be found, because of the great resort of Gentlemen, from all parts of the Colony to these Courts as well to see Fashions, as to dispatch their particular Business. Nor is Visinage necessary
<pb n="23"/>
there, to distinguish the several Customs of particular places, the whole Country being as one Neighbourhood, and having the same Tenures of Land, Usages and Customs.</p>
                        <p>The Grand-Juries are impanneled much after the same manner; but because they require a greater number of Men, and the Court is always desirous to have some, from all parts of the Country, they give their Sheriff order the Morning before, to provide his Pannel.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>§. 28. In Criminal Matters this Method is a little altered; because a knowledge of the Life, and Conversation of the Party, may give light to the Jury in their Verdict. For this reason a Writ of <hi rend="italics">Venire</hi> issues in such cases, to summon six of the nearest Neighbours to the Criminal, who must be of the same County wherein he liv'd; which Writ of <hi rend="italics">Venire</hi> is return'd by the Sheriff of the respective County, to the Secretaries Office, and the Names are taken from thence, by the Sheriff attending the General Court, and put in the front of the Pannel, which is fill'd up with the Names of the other Gentlemen summon'd in the Town, to be of the Petty-Jury for the Tryal of that Criminal. If the Prisoner have a mind to challenge the Jurors, the same liberty is allowed him there as in <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> and if the Pannel fall short, by reason of such challenge, it must then be made up of the By-standers.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>§. 29. All Actions are in that Country brought to a Determination the third Court at farthest, unless some special extraordinary reason be shewn, why the Party can't make his Defence so soon. The course is thus; upon the Defendant's Non-appearance, order goes against the Bail, (for a
<pb n="24"/>
                           <hi rend="italics">Capias</hi> is always their first Process) on condition, that unless the Defendant appear, and plead at the next Court, Judgment shall then be awarded for the Plaintiff: When the Defendant comes to the next Court, he is held to plead; and if his Plea be Dilatory, and over-rul'd, he is held to plead over immediately; and if it can be, the Merits are tryed that Court; but the next it is ended without fail, except something happen to make it highly unreasonable. Thus a year and half ends a Cause in the General Court, and three Months in the County-Court. If any one Appeal from the Judgment of the County-Court, the Tryal always comes on, the succeeding General Court; so that all business begun in the County-Court, tho' it runs to the utmost of the Law, (without some extraordinary event) is finished in nine Months.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>§. 30. Every one that pleases, may plead his own Cause, or else his Friends for him, there being no restraint in that case, nor any licensed Practitioners in the Law: If any one be dissatisfied with the Judgment of the County-Court, let it be for any Sum, little or great, he may have an Appeal to the next General Court, giving Security to answer, and abide the Judgment of that Court: but an Action cannot originally be brought in the General Court, under the value of ten pounds Sterling, or of two thousand pounds of Tobacco.</p>

                        <p>§. 31. The County-Courts are constituted by Commission from the Governor, with advice of Council. They consist of eight or more Gentlemen of the County, called Justices of the Peace, the Sheriff being only a Ministerial Officer. This Court is held Monthly, and has Jurisdiction of
<pb n="25"/>
all Causes within the County, not touching Life or Member: But in the case of Hog-stealing, they may Sentence the Criminal to lose his Ears; which is allow'd by a particular Act for that purpose In all things they proceed in the same manner as the General Court.</p>
                     </div>

                        <p>§. 32. Besides this Monthly Court, there is a day appointed, to be kept annually by the Justices of the said Court, for the care of all Orphans and of their Estates; and for the binding out, and well ordering of such fatherless Children, who are either without any Estate, or have very little.</p>
                        <p>At these Courts, they inquire into the keeping and management of the Orphan, as to his Sustenance and Education: They examine into his Estate, and the Securities thereof; If the Sureties continue to be Responsible, if his Lands and Plantations be kept improving, and in Repair, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> If the poor Orphan be bound an Apprentice to any Trade, then their business is to inquire, how he is kept to his Schooling, and Trade; and if the Court find he is either misused, or untaught, they take him from that Master, and put him to another of the same Trade, or of any other Trade, which they judge best for the Child.</p>
                        <p>Another charitable Method in favour of the poor Orphans there, is this; That besides their Trade and Schooling, the Masters are generally obliged, to give them at their Freedom, Cattle, Tools, or other things, to the value of five, six, or ten pounds, according to the Age of the Child when bound, over and above the usual quantity of Corn, and Cloaths. The Boys are bound till one and twenty years of Age, and the Girls till eighteen: At which time, they who have taken any
<pb n="26"/>
care to improve themselves, generally get well Married, and live in Plenty, tho they had not a farthing of paternal Estate.</p>
                        <p>Though these Courts be yearly appointed for that use, yet the Justices do not fail every County-Court, as occasion happens, to do every thing that can be for the benefit of Orphans; and this Annual Court seems to be only a review of their years Work, or a Retrospection into the observance of their former Orders.</p>

The People are generally of the Church of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> which is the Religion establisht by Law in that Country, from which there are very few Dissenters. Yet liberty of Conscience is given to all other Congregations pretending to Christianity, on condition they submit to all Parish Duties. They have no more than five Conventicles amongst them, namely, three small Meetings of Quakers, and two of Presbyterians. 'Tis observ'd, that those Counties where the Presbyterian Meetings are, produce very mean Tobacco; and for that reason can't get an Orthodox Minister to stay amongst them; but whenever they cou'd, the People very orderly went to Church: As for the Quakers, 'tis observ'd by letting them alone, they decrease daily.</p>

The Maintenance for a Minister there, is appointed by Law at 16,000 pounds of Tobacco <hi rend="italics">per Annum,</hi> (be the Parish great or small) as also a Dwelling-House and Glebe, together with certain Perquisites for Marriages, and Funeral Sermons. That which makes the difference in the Benefices of the Clergy, is the value of the Tobacco, according to the distinct Species of it, or according to the place of its Growth; Besides in large and rich Parishes, more Marriages will probably happen, and more Funeral Sermons.</p>
                        <p>The Fee by Law for a Funeral Sermon, is forty Shillings, or four hundred pounds of Tobacco; for a Marriage by Licence, twenty Shillings, or two hundred pounds of Tobacco, and where the Banes are proclaim'd, only 5 <hi rend="italics">s.</hi> or 50 <hi rend="italics">l.</hi> of Tobacco.</p>
                        <p>When these Salaries were granted, the Assembly valued Tobacco at 10 Shillings <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Hundred;
<pb n="28"/>
at which Rate, the 16,000 <hi rend="italics">l.</hi> comes to fourscore pounds Sterling; but in all Parishes where the Sweet-sented grows, it has generally been sold of late, for near double that value, and never under.</p>
                        <p>In some Parishes likewise there are stocks of Cattle and Negros, on the Glebes, which are also allow'd to the Minister, for his Use and Incouragement; he only being accountable for the surrender of the same value, when he leaves the Parish.</p>

These Vestries consist of twelve Gentlemen of the Parish, and were at first chosen by the Vote of the Parishoners; but upon the Death of one, have been continued by the Survivor's electing another in his place. These are the Patrons of the Church and in the Name of the Parish, have the Presentation of Ministers, as well as the sole power of all Parish Assessments They are qualified for this Employment, by subscribing, to be conformable to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> If there be a Minister incumbent, he is always chief of the Vestry.</p>
                        <p>For the ease of the Vestry in General, and for discharging the Business of the Parish, they choose two from among themselves, to be Church-Wardens, which must be annually chang'd, that the burden may lie equally upon all. The business of these Church-Wardens, is to see the Orders, and Agreements of the Vestry perform'd; to collect all the Parish Tobacco's, and distribute them to the several Claimers; to make up the Accounts of the Parish, and to present all Profaneness and Immorality.</p>

This was ordain'd by the Law of the Country, for the ease of the Ministers, that so they being delivered, from the trouble of gathering in their Dues, may have the more time to apply themselves to the Exercises of their Holy Function, and live in a Decency suitable to their Order. It may here be observ'd, that the Labour of a dozen Negroes, does but answer this Salary, and seldom yields a greater Crop of Sweet-sented Tobacco, than is allow'd to each of their Ministers.</p>

The Custom of the Country takes place upon such as have no Indentures. The Law in this case is, that if such Servants be under Nineteen years of Age, they must be brought into Court, to have their Age

                        <p>Sufficient Distinction is also made between the Female-Servants, and Slaves; for a White Woman is rarely or never put to work in the Ground, if she be good for any thing else: And to Discourage all Planters from using any Women so, their Law imposes the heaviest Taxes upon Female-Servants working in the Ground, while it suffers all other white Women to be absolutely exempted: Whereas on the other hand, it is a common thing to work a Woman Slave out of Doors; nor does the Law make any Distinction in her Taxes, whether her Work be Abroad, or at Home.</p>

Because I have heard how strangely cruel, and severe, the Service of this Country is represented in some parts of <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> I can't forbear affirming, that the work of their Servants, and Slaves, is no other than what every common Freeman do's. Neither is any Servant requir'd to do more in a Day, than his Overseer. And I can assure you with a great deal of Truth, that generally their Slaves are not worked near so hard, nor so many Hours in a Day,
<pb n="37"/>
as the Husbandmen, and Day-Labourers in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> An Overseer is a Man, that having served his time, has acquired the Skill and Character of an experienced Planter, and is therefore intrusted with the Direction of the Servants and Slaves.</p>
                        <p>But to compleat this account of Servants, I shall give you a short Relation of the care their Laws take, that they be used as tenderly as possible.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. All Servants whatsoever, have their Complaints heard without Fee, or Reward; but if the Master be found Faulty, the charge of the Complaint is cast upon him, otherwise the business is done <hi rend="italics">ex Officio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Any Justice of Peace may receive the Complaint of a Servant, and order every thing relating thereto, till the next County-Court, where it will be finally determin'd.</p>
                        <p>3. All Masters are under the Correction, and Censure of the County-Courts, to provide for their Servants, good and wholesome Diet, Clothing, and Lodging.</p>
                        <p>4. They are always to appear, upon the first Notice given of the Complaint of their Servants, otherwise to forfeit the Service of them, until they do appear.</p>
                        <p>5. All Servants Complaints are to be receiv'd at any time in Court, without Process, and shall not be delay'd for want of Form; but the Merits of the Complaint must be immediately inquir'd into by the Justices; and if the Master cause any delay therein, the Court may remove such Servants, if they see Cause, until the Master will come to Tryal.</p>
                        <pb n="38"/>
                        <p>6. If a Master shall at any time disobey an Order of Court, made upon any Complaint of a Servant; the Court is impower'd to remove such Servant forthwith to another Master; who will be kinder; Giving to the former Master the produce only, (after Fees deducted) of what such Servants shall be sold for by Publick Outcry.</p>
                        <p>7. If a Master should be so cruel, as to use his Servant ill, that is faln Sick, or Lame in his Service, and thereby render'd unfit for Labour, he must be remov'd by the Church-Wardens out of the way of such Cruelty, and boarded in some good Planters House, till the time of his Freedom, the charge of which must be laid before the next County-Court, which has power to levy the same from time to time, upon the Goods and Chattels of the Master; After which, the charge of such Boarding is to come upon the Parish in General.</p>
                        <p>8. All hired Servants are intituled to these Priviledges.</p>
                        <p>9. No Master of a Servant, can make a new Bargain for Service, or other Matter with his Servant, without the privity and consent of a Justice of Peace, to prevent the Master's Overreaching, or scareing such Servant into an unreasonable Complyance.</p>
                        <p>10. The property of all Money and Goods sent over thither to Servants, or carry'd in with them; is reserv'd to themselves, and remain intirely at their disposal.</p>
                        <p>11. Each Servant at his Freedom, receives of his Master fifteen Bushels of Corn, (which is sufficient for a whole year) and two new Suits of Cloaths, both Linnen and Woollen; and then becomes as free in all respects, and as much entituled to the Liberties, and Priviledges of the Country, as any other of the Inhabitants or Natives are.</p>

                        <p>12. Each Servant has then also a Right to take up fifty Acres of Land, where he can find any unpatented: But that is no great Privilege, for any one may have as good a right for a piece of Eight.</p>
                        <p>This is what the Laws prescribe in favour of Servants, by which you may find, that the Cruelties and Severities imputed to that Country, are are an unjust Reflection.

                        <p>§. 59. A Patent for Land upon Survey, is acquired thus. First, the Man proves his Rights; that is, he makes Oath in Court, of the Importation
<pb n="42"/>
of so many Persons, with a List of their Names. This List is then certified by the Clerk of that Court, to the Clerk of the Secretaries Office; who examines into the Validity of them, and files them in that Office, attesting them to be regular. When the Rights are thus certified, they are produced to the Survey or of the County, and the Land is shewed to him; who thereupon is bound by his Oath to make the Survey, if the Land had been not Patented before. These Rights to Land, are as commonly sold by one Man to another, as the Land it self; so that any one, not having Rights by his own Importation, may have them by Purchase.</p>
                        <p>It is the business of the Surveyor also, to take care, that the Bounds of his Survey be plainly marked, either by natural Boundaries, or else by chopping Notches in the Trees, that happen in the lines of his Courses: But this is done at the charge of the Man that employs him.</p>
                        <p>This Survey being made, a Copy thereof is carried, with the Certificate of Rights to the Secretaries Office, and there (if there be no Objection) a Patent must of course be made out upon it, which is presented to the Governor and Council for them to pass; the Patentee having no more to do, but to send for it when it is perfected, and to pay the Fee, at the first Crop, to the Sheriff of the County, by whom annually the Fees are collected.</p>
                        <p>This Patent gives an Estate in Fee-simple, upon Condition, of paying a Quit-Rent of twelve pence for every fifty Acres, and of Planting or Seating thereon, within three years, according to their Law; that is, to clear, plant, and tend an Acre of Ground with Corn, or to build an House, and keep a stock of Cattle, for one whole year together upon the Land; after which 'tis presum'd
<pb n="43"/>
they will continue the Settlement, and not let the Stock be lost, which after it has got a tast of those new Plantations, will never afterwards without Consinement, remain at an old one. I know that a certain grave Author of much Learning, and little Knowledge of the Plantations, Ridicules this Law, in his Discourses on the Trade of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> Part 2. Pag. 236. But I believe if he had Land there, under the Conditions of that Law, he would not, with all his Skill in shifting, be able either to avoid paying the Quit-rents, or to continue his Right, by erecting a Hutt of Bark, as he calls it. This Adventrous Gentleman, has several unjust Reflections upon that Country: But I impute them all to his Writing wholly in favour of the Propriety-Government, and upon other Peoples Information, who know as little of the Matter as himself.</p>

                        <p>§. 60. Lapsed Land, is when any one having obtain'd a Patent as before, doth not Seat or Plant thereon within three years, as the Condition of the Patent requires; but leaves it still altogether uninhabited, and uncultivated: In such case it is said to be Lapsed, and any Man is at liberty to obtain a new Patent of it in his own Name; the method of acquiring which Patent, is thus.</p>
                        <p>The Party must apply himself by Petition to the General Court, setting forth all the Circumstances of the Lapse. If this Petition be allow'd, the Court makes an Order, that a Patent be prepared for the Petitioner, upon the same Condition, of Seating or Planting within three years, as was in the former Parent. Thus Land may be lapsed or lost several times, by the negligence of the Patentees; who by such. Omission, lose not only the Land, but all their Rights, and Charges into the bargain.</p>

                        <p>§. 61. When Land is supposed to Escheat, the Governor issues his Warrant to the Escheator, to make Inquest thereof: And when upon such Inquest, Office is found for the Queen, it must be recorded in the Secretaries Office, and there kept nine Months, to see if any Person will lay claim to it, or can traverse the Escheat. If any such appear, upon his Petition to the General Court, he is heard, before any Grant can be made. If no Person oppose the Inquest, the Land is given to the Man that shews the best equitable right thereto; and if there be none such, it is then granted to any one, that the Governor and Council shall think fit, the Grantee always paying two pounds of Tobacco <hi rend="italics">per</hi> Acre into the Treasury of the Country, as a Fine of Composition with her Majesty for her Escheat; And thereupon a Patent issues reciting the Premises.</p>

                        <p>In the year 1699, there went over in about three hundred of these, and the year following about two hundred more, and so on, till there arrived in all, between seven and eight hundred Men, Women, and Children, who had fled from <hi rend="italics">France</hi> on account of their Religion.</p>
                        <p>Those who went over the first year, were advised to Seat on a piece of very rich Land, about twenty Miles above the Falls of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River, on the <hi rend="italics">South</hi> side of the River; which Land was formerly the Seat of a Great and Warlike Nation of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> call'd the <hi rend="italics">Monacàns,</hi> none of which are now left in those Parts; but the Land still retains their Name, and is call'd the <hi rend="italics">Monacàn</hi> Town.</p>

                        <pb n="46"/>
                        <p>The Assembly was very bountiful to those who remain'd at this Town, bestowing on them large. Donations, Money, and Provisions for their Support; they likewise freed them from every Publick Tax, for several years to come, and addrest the Governor, to grant them a Brief, to entitle them to the Charity of all well-dispos'd Persons throughout the Country, which together with the Kings Benevolence, supported them very comfortably, till they could sufficiently supply themselves with Necessaries, which now they do indifferently well, and begin to have Stocks of Cattle, which are said to give abundantly more Milk, than any other in the Country. I have heard that these People are upon a design, of getting into the breed of Buffaloes, to which end they lie in wait for their Calves, that they may tame, and raise a Stock of them. In which if they succeed, 'twill in all probability be greatly for their Advantage; for these are much larger than other Cattle, and have the benefit of being natural to the Climate.</p>
                        <p>They now make many of their own Cloaths, and are resolved, as soon as they have improv'd that Manufacture, to apply themselves to the making of Wine and Brandy, which they do not doubt to bring to Perfection.</p>
                        <p>The last year they began an Essay of Wine, which they made of the wild Grapes gather'd in the Woods; the effect of which, was Noble strong-bodied Claret, of a curious flavour. I heard a Gentleman, who tasted it, give it great Commendation. Now if such may be made of the wild Vine in the Woods, without Pruning, Weeding, or removing it out of the Shade, what may not be produc'd from a Vinyard skilfully Cultivated?</p>

these distressed <hi rend="italics">Hugonots.</hi> Upon their first Arrival in that Country, he receiv'd them with all the tenderness of a Father; and ever since has constantly given them the utmost Assistance. He not only relieves them, but with a Charity very uncommon, is fond of doing it. He makes them the object of his particular care, employing all his Skill, and all his Friends, to advance their Interest, both publickly and privately. He spares no Expence, and what is more than that, he refuses no trouble for their Incouragement. What Liberties has he not all along allow'd them, upon his own Plantations, to furnish themselves from thence with Corn, and other Necessaries? His Mills have been at their Service, to grind their Corn Toll-free, and his People are order'd upon all occasions to assist them. How kind has he been in procuring them Contributions from other People? With what, Zeal did he represent their Cause to the Assembly? And with what earnestness did he press all his Friends in their favour, who otherwise told him, they could not have believ'd their Case to be, as he related it? For even Poverty in all its Distress, cou'd not guard them from ill Reports, which wou'd have had a severe effect upon them, had they not been protected by the Interest, and Credit of this Honourable Gentleman. With what delight did he afterwards gather in the Benevolence, that was given? How frequently do's he continue still to visit their Families, and with what Importunity do's he press them, to make their wants known to him, that takes pleasure in relieving them? It is easie to imagin, how necessary to an Infant Settlement, are the Assistances of so generous a Friend. When several hundred Families of Men, Women, and Children are set ashoar Naked and Hungry, in a strange
<pb n="48"/>
Land, they have not only necessity to struggle with, but likewise with the Envy of Ill-natur'd People, who fancy they come to eat the Bread out of their Mouths: All these Difficulties befell these poor Refugees at their first Arrival there; but God Almighty rais'd up this Gentleman, not only to Succour them with his own Charity, but to solicit the Liberalities of other People. By these Helps they have hitherto Subsisted, and been put into some Condition to shift for themselves. However, they are not yet so far advanc'd, but that their Patron, may still have an opportunity, of shewing his Kindness towards them; which is to prevail with the Assembly, to bestow upon them a certain Title to the Land they now possess, to which as yet they have no other Right, but the bare sitting down upon unseated Land. This seems to be worthy of an early care, lest the Land which they have improv'd by their Industry from wild Woods, should here-after unjustly be taken away from their Children.</p>

From hence it came to pass, that when they were setled there in a comfortable way of Subsisting a Family, they grew sensible of the Misfortune of wanting Wives, and such as had left Wives in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> sent for them; but the single Men were put to their Shifts.

When I come to speak of their Cattle, I can't forbear charging my Country-men with exceeding Ill-Husbandry, in not providing sufficiently for them all Winter, by which means they starve their young Cattle, or at least stint their Growth; so that they seldom or never grow so large as they would do, if they were well manag'd; for the humour is there, if People can but save the lives of their Cattle, tho' they suffer them to be never so poor in the Winter, yet they will presently grow fat again in the Spring, which they esteem sufficient for their purpose.

THE Natural Temperature of the Inhabited part of the Country, is hot and moist: tho' this Moisture I take to be occasion'd by the abundance of low Grounds, Marshes, Creeks, and Rivers, which are every where among their lower Settlements; but more backward in the Woods, where they are now Seating, and making new Plantations, they have abundance of high and dry Land, where there are only Crystal Streams of Water, which flow gently from their Springs, and divide themselves into innumerable Branches, to moisten and enrich the adjacent Lands.</p>

                        <p>§. 78. The Country is in a very happy Situation, between the extreams of Heat and Cold, but inclining rather to the first. Certainly it must be a happy Climate, since it is very near of the same Latitude with the Land of Promise. Besides, As <hi rend="italics">Judoea</hi> was full of Rivers, and Branches of Rivers; So is <hi rend="italics">Virginia:</hi> As that was seated upon a great Bay and Sea, wherein were all the conveniences for Shipping and Trade; So is <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi> Had that fertility of Soil? So has <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> equal to any Land in the known World. In fine, if any one impartially considers all the Advantages of this Country, as Nature made it; he must allow it to be as fine a Place, as any in the Universe; but I confess I am asham'd to say any thing of its Improvements, because I must
<pb n="60"/>
at the same time reproach my Country-Men with a Laziness that is unpardonable. If there be any excuse for them in this Matter, 'tis the exceeding plenty of good things, with which Nature has blest them; for where God Almighty is so Merciful as to work for People, they never work for themselves.</p>

                        <p>§. 79. That which makes this Country most unfortunate, is, that it must submit to receive its Character from the Mouths not only of unfit, but very unequal Judges; For, all its Reproaches happen after this manner.</p>
                        <p>Many of the Merchants and others that go thither from <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> make no distinction between a cold, and a hot Country: but wisely go sweltering about in their thick Cloaths all the Summer, because they used to do so in their <hi rend="italics">Northern</hi> Climate; and then unfairly complain of the heat of the Country. They greedily Surfeit with their delicious Fruits, and are guilty of great Intemperance, through the exceeding Generosity of the Inhabitants; by which means they fall Sick, and then unjustly complain of the unhealthiness of the Country. In the next place, the Sailers for want of Towns there, are put to the hardship of rowing most of the Tobacco, a Mile or more, to the Water-side; this Splinters
<pb n="61"/>
their Hands sometimes, and provokes 'em to curse the Country. Such Exercise, and a bright Sun, makes them hot, and then they imprudently fall to drinking cold Water, or perhaps New Cyder, which in its Season, they find at every Planter's House; Or else they greedily devour all the green Fruit, and unripe Trash they can meet with, and so fall into Fluxes, Fevers, and the Belly-Ach; and then, to spare their own Indiscretion, they in their Tarpawlin Language, cry, God D— the Country. This is the true State of the case, as to the Complaints of its being Sickly; For, by the most impartial Observation I can make, if People will be perswaded to be Temperate, and take due care of themselves, I believe it is as healthy a Country, as any under Heaven: but the extraordinary pleasantness of the Weather, and the goodness of the Fruit, lead People into many Temptations. The clearness and brightness of the Sky, add new vigour to their Spirits, and perfectly remove all Splenetick and sullen Thoughts. Here they enjoy all the benefits of a warm Sun, and by their shady Groves, are protected from its Inconvenience. Here all their Senses are entertain'd with an endless Succession of Native Pleasures. Their Eyes are ravished with the Beauties of naked Nature. Their Ears are Serenaded with the perpetual murmur of Brooks, and the thorow-base which the Wind plays, when it wantons through the Trees; the merry Birds too, join their pleasing Notes to this rural Consort, especially the Mock-birds, who love Society so well, that whenever they see Mankind, they will perch upon a Twigg very near them, and sing the sweetest wild Airs in the World: But what is most remarkable in these Melodious Animals, they will frequently fly at small distances before a Traveller, warbling out
<pb n="62"/>
their Notes several Miles an end, and by their Musick, make a Man forget the Fatigues of his Journey. Their Taste is regaled with the most delicious Fruits, which without Art, they have in great Variety and Perfection. And then their smell is refreshed with an eternal fragrancy of Flowers and Sweets, with which Nature perfumes and adorns the Woods almost the whole year round.</p>
                        <p>Have you pleasure in a Garden? All things thrive in it, most surprisingly; you can't walk by a Bed of Flowers, but besides the entertainment of their Beauty, your Eyes will be saluted with the charming colours of the Humming Bird, which revels among the Flowers, and licks off the Dew and Honey from their render Leaves, on which it only feeds. It's size is not half so large as an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Wren, and its colour is a glorious shining mixture of Scarlet, Green, and Gold. Colonel <hi rend="italics">Byrd,</hi> in his Garden, which is the finest in that Country, has a Summer-House set round with the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Honey-Suckle, which all the Summer is continually full of sweet Flowers, in which these Birds delight exceedingly. Upon these Flowers, I have seen ten or a dozen of these Beautiful Creatures together, which sported about me so familiarly, that with their little Wings they often fann'd my Face.</p>

                        <p>I confess, in the hottest part of Summer, they have sometimes very loud and surprizing Thunder, but rarely any Dammage happens by it. On the country, it is of such advantage to the
<pb n="63"/>
cooling and refining of the Air, that it is oftner wished for, than fear'd. But they have no Earthquakes, which the <hi rend="italics">Caribbee</hi> Islands are so much troubled with.</p>
                        <p>Their Heat is very seldom troublesome, and then only by the accident of a perfect Calm, which happens perhaps two or three times in a year, and lasts but a few Hours at a time; and even that Inconvenience is made easie by cool Shades, by open Airy rooms, Summer-Houses, Arbors, and Grottos: But the Spring and Fall, afford as pleasant Weather, as <hi rend="italics">Mahomet</hi> promis'd in his Paradise.</p>
                        <p>All the troublesom Vermine, that ever I heard any Body complain of, are either Frogs, Snakes, Muskera's, Chinches, Seedticks, or Red-worms, by some call'd Potato-lice. Of all which I shall give an account in their Order.</p>
                        <p>Some People have been so ill inform'd, as to say, that <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> is full of Toads, though there never yet was seen one Toad in it. The Marshes, Fens, and Watry Grounds, are indeed full of harmless Frogs, which do no hurt, except by the noise of their croaking Notes: but in the upper parts of the Country, where the Land is high and dry, they are very scarce. In the Swamps and running Streams, they have Frogs of an incredible bigness, which are call'd Bull-frogs, from the roaring they make. Last year I found one of these near a Stream of fresh Water, of so prodigious a Magnitude, that when I extended its Leggs, I found the distance betwixt them, to be seventeen Inches and an half. I am confident, six <hi rend="italics">French-Men</hi> might have made a comfortable Meal of its Carcase.</p>
                        <p>Some People in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> are startled at the very Name of the Rattle-Snake, and fancy every corner of that Province so much pester'd with them, that a Man goes in constant danger of his Life,
<pb n="64"/>
that walks abroad in the Woods. But this is as gross a Mistake, as most of the other ill reports of this Country. For in the first place, this Snake is very rarely seen; and when that happens, it never do's the least Mischief, unless you offer to disturb it, and thereby prevoke it to bite in its own defence. But it never fails to give you fair warning, by making a noise with its Rattle, which may be heard at a convenient distance. For my own part, I have travell'd the Country as much as any Man in it of my Age, by Night and by Day, above the Inhabitants; as well as among them; and yet I never see a Rattle-Snake alive, and at liberty, in all my Life. I have seen them indeed after they have been killed, or pent up into Boxes to be sent to <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> The bite of this Viper, without some immediate Application, is certainly Death; but Remedies are so well known, that none of their Servants are ignorant of them. I never knew any that had been hurt by these, or any other of their Snakes, although I have a general knowledge all over the Country, and have been in every part of it. They have several other Snakes which are seen more frequently, and have very little or no hurt in them, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> such as they call Black-Snakes, Water-Snakes, and Corn-Snakes. The black Viper-Snake, and the Copper-bellied Snake, are said to be as Venemous as the Rattle-Snake, but they also are as seldom seen; these three poisonous Snakes, bring forth their young alive, whereas the other three sorts lay Eggs, which are hatched afterwards; and that is the distinction they make, esteeming only those to be Venemous, which are Viviparous. They have likewise the Horn-Snake, so call'd from a sharp Horn it carries in its Tail, with which it assaults any thing that offends it, with that force, that
<pb n="65"/>
it will strike its Tail into the But-end of a Musquet, from whence it is not able to dis engage it self.</p>
                        <p>All sorts of Snakes will charm both Birds, and Squirrels, and the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> pretend to charm them. Several Persons have seen Squirrels run down a Tree, directly into a Snakes mouth; they have likewise seen Birds fluttering up and down, and chattering at these Snakes, till at last they have dropt down just before them.</p>
                        <p>Some few years agoe, I was a Bear-Hunting in the Woods above the Inhabitants, and having straggled from my Companions, I was entertain'd at my return, with the Relation of a pleasant Rencounter, between a Dog and Rattle-Snake, about a Squirrel. The Snake had got the Head and Shoulders of the Squirrel into his Mouth, which being something too large for his Throat, it took him up some time to moisten the Furr of the Squirrel with his Spawl, to make it slip down. The Dog took this Advantage, seiz'd the hinder parts of the Squirrel, and tugg'd with all his Might. The Snake on the other side- wou'd not let go his hold for a long time, till at last, fearing he might be bruised by the Dog's running away with him, he gave up his Prey to the Enemy, which he eat, and we eat the Snake, which was dainty food.</p>
                        <p>Musketaes are a sort of Vermin, of less danger, but much more troublesom, because more frequent. They are a long tail'd Gnat, such as are in all Fens, and low Grounds in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and I think, have no other difference from them than the Name. Neither are they troubled with 'em any where, but in their low Grounds, and Marshes. These Insects I believe are stronger, and continue longer there, by reason of the warm Sun, than in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> Whoever is persecuted with
<pb n="66"/>
them in his House there, may get rid of them, by this easie Remedy. Let him but set open his Windows at Sun-set, and shut them again before the Twilight be quite shut in, and all the Musketaes in the Room, will go out at the Windows, and leave the Room clear.</p>
                        <p>Chinches are a sort of flat Bug, which lurks in the Beadsteads and Bedding, and disturbs People's Rest a-nights. Every neat House-Wife contrives there, by several Devices, to keep her Beds clear of them. But the best way I ever heard, effectually to destroy them, is by a narrow search among the Bedding early in the Spring, before these Vermin begin to Nitt, and run about; for they lie snug all the Winter, and are in the Spring large and full of the Winters Growth, having all their Seed within them; and so they become a fair Mark to find, and may with their whole Breed be destroy'd.</p>
                        <p>Seed-Ticks, and Red-Worms are small Insects, that annoy People by day, as Musketaes, and Chinches do by Night: but both these keep out of your way, if you will keep out of theirs; for Seed-Ticks are no where to be met with, but in the track of Cattle, upon which the great Ticks fasten, and fill their Skins so full of Blood, that they drop off, and where-ever they happen to fall, they produce a kind of Egg, which lies about a Fort-night, before the Seedlings are Hatcht. These Seedlings run in Swarms up the next blade of Grass, that lies in their way, and then the first thing that brushes that blade of Grass, gathers off most of these Vermine, which stick like burrs, upon anything that touches them.</p>
                        <p>Red-Worms lie only in old dead Trees, and rotten Loggs; and without sitting down upon such, a Man never meets with them, nor at any other Season, but only in the midst of Summer.
<pb n="67"/>
A little warm Water, immediately brings off both Seed-Ticks, and Red-Worms, tho' they lie never so thick upon any part of the Body: but without some such Remedy, they are so small, that nothing will lay hold of them, but the point of a Pen-Knife, Needle, or such like. And tho nothing be done to remove them, yet the itching they occasion, goes away after two days.</p>

Their Winters are very short, and don't continue above three or four Months, of which they have seldom thirty days of unpleasant Weather, all the rest being blest with a clear Air, and a bright Sun. However, they have very hard Frost sometimes, but it rarely lasts above three or four days, that is, till the Wind change; for if it blow not between the <hi rend="italics">North-East,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">North-West</hi> Points, from the cold Appellatian Mountains, they have no Frost at all. But these Frosts are attended with a Serene Sky, and are otherwise made Delightful, by the tameness of the Wild-fowl and other Game, which by their incredible Number, afford the pleasantest Shooting in the World.</p>
                        <p>Their Rains, except in the depth of Winter, are extreamly agreeable and refreshing. All the Summer long they last but a few Hours at a time, and sometimes not above half an Hour, and then immediately succeeds clear Sun-shine again: but in that short time it rains so powerfully, that it quits the debt of a long Drought, and makes every thing green and gay.</p>

WHile we are upon the Climate, and its Accidents, it will not be improper, to mention the Diseases incident to <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi> Distempers come not there by choaking up the Spirits, with a foggy and thick Air, as in some <hi rend="italics">Northern</hi> Climes; nor by a stifling Heat, that exhales the vigour of those, that dwell in a more <hi rend="italics">Southerly</hi> Latitude: But by a wilful and foolish indulging themselves in those Pleasures, which in a warm and fruitful Country, Nature lavishes upon Mankind, for their Happiness, and not for their Destruction.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have seen Persons impatient of Heat, lie almost naked upon the cold Grass in the Shades, and there often forgetting themselves fall asleep. Nay, many are so imprudent, as to do this in an Evening, and perhaps lie so all Night; when between the Dew from Heaven, and the Damps from the Earth, such impressions are made upon the humours of their Body, as occasion fatal Distempers.</p>
                        <p>Thus also have I seen Persons put into a great heat by excessive Action, and in the midst of that Heat, strip off their Cloaths, and expose their open Pores to the Air. Nay, I have known
<pb n="69"/>
some mad enough in this hot Condition, to take huge draughts of cold Water, or perhaps of Milk and Water, which they esteem much more cold in Operation, than Water alone.</p>
                        <p>And thus likewise have I seen several People, (especially New-Comers) so intemperate in devouring the pleasant Fruits, that they have fallen into dangerous Fluxes, and Surfeits. These, and such like Disorders, are the chief occasions of their Diseases.</p>

                        <p>Their Intermitting Fevers, as well as their Agues, are very troublesome, if a fit Remedy be not apply'd; but of late the Doctors there, have made use of the <hi rend="italics">Cortex Peruviana</hi> with Success, and find that it seldom or never fails to remove the Fits. The Planters too, have several Roots natural to the Country, which in this case they cry up as Infallible. They have the Happiness to have very few Doctors, and those such as make use only of simple Remedies, of which their Woods afford great Plenty. And indeed, their Distempers are not many, and their Cures are so generally known, that there is not Mystery enough, to make a Trade of Physick there, as the Learned do in other Countries, to the great oppression of Mankind.</p>

In their Woods and Fields, they have an unknown variety of Vegetables, and other rarities of Nature to discover and observe. They have Hunting, Fishing, and Fowling, with which they entertain themselves an hundred ways. Here is the most Good-nature, and Hospitality practis'd in the World, both towards Friends and Strangers: but the worst of it is, this Generosity is attended now and then, with a little too much Intemperance. The Neighbourhood is at much the same distance, as in the Country in <hi rend="italics">England:</hi> but with this Advantage, that all the better sort of People have been abroad, and seen the World, by which means they are free from that stiffness and formality, which discover more Civility, than Kindness: And besides, the goodness of the Roads, and the fairness of the Weather, bring People oftener together.</p>

                        <p>§. 87. The <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as I have already observ'd, had in their Hunting, a way of concealing themselves, and coming up to the Deer, under the blind of a Stalking-Head, in imitation of which, many People have taught their Horses to stalk it, that is, to walk gently by the Huntsman's side, to cover him from the sight of the
<pb n="72"/>
Deer. Others cut down Trees for the Deer to browze upon, and lie in wait behind them. Others again set Stakes, at a certain distance within their Fences, where the Deer have been used to leap over into a Field of Peas, which they love extreamly; these Stakes they so place, as to run into the Body of the Deer, when he Pitches, by which means they Impale him.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <p>§. 88. They Hunt their Hares, (which are very numerous) a Foot, with Mungrils or swift Dogs, which either catch them quickly, or force them to hole in a hollow Tree, whither all their Hares generally tend, when they are closely pursued. As soon as they are thus holed, and have crawl'd up into the Body of the Tree, the business is to kindle a Fire, and smother them with Smoak, till they let go their hold, and fall to the bottom stifled; from whence they take them. If they have a mind to spare their Lives, upon turning them loose, they will be as fit as ever to hunt at another time; for the mischief done them by the Smoak, immediately wears off again.</p>

                        <p>§. 89. They have another sort of Hunting, which is very diverting, and that they call Vermine Hunting; It is perform'd a Foot, with small Dogs in the Night, by the Light of the Moon or Stars. Thus in Summer-time they find abundance of Raccoons, Opossums, and Foxes in the Corn-Fields, and about their Plantations: but at other times, they must go into the Woods for them. The Method is to go out with three or four Dogs, and as soon as they come to the place, they bid the Dogs seek out, and all the Company follow immediately. Where-ever a Dog barks, you may depend upon finding
<pb n="73"/>
the Game; and this Alarm, draws both Men and Dogs that way. If this Sport be in the Woods, the Game by that time you come near it, is perhaps mounted to the top of an high Tree, and then they detach a nimble Fellow up after it, who must have a scuffle with the Beast, before he can throw it down to the Dogs; and then the Sport increases, to see the Vermine encounter those little Currs. In this sort of Hunting, they also carry their great Dogs out with them, because Wolves, Bears, Panthers, Wild-Cats, and all other Beasts of Prey, are abroad in the Night.</p>
                        <p>For Wolves they make Traps, and set Guns bated in the Woods, so that when he offers to seize the Bate, he pulls the Trigger, and the Gun discharges upon him. What <hi rend="italics">Elian</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Pliny</hi> write, of the Horses being benummed in their Legs, if they tread in the Track of a Wolf, does not hold good here; for I my self, and many others, have rid full Speed after Wolves in the Woods, and have seen live ones taken out of a Trap, and drag'd at a Horse's Tail; and yet those that follow'd on Horse-back, have not perceived any of their Horses to falter in their pace.</p>

                        <p>§. 90. They have many pretty devices besides the Gun, to take wild Turkeys; And among others, a Friend of mine invented a great Trap, wherein he at times caught many Turkeys, and particularly seventeen at one time, but he could not contrive it so, as to let others in after he had entrapped the first flock, until they were taken out.</p>

<pb n="74"/>
which, they make use of Seins, Trolls, Casting-Netts, Setting-Netts, Hand-fishing, and Angling, and in each find abundance of Diversion. I have set in the shade, at the Heads of the Rivers Angling, and spent as much time in taking the Fish off the Hook, as in waiting for their taking it. Like those of the <hi rend="italics">Euxine</hi> Sea they also Fish with Spilyards, which is a long Line staked out in the River, and hung with a great many Hooks on short strings, fasten'd to the main Line, about three or four Foot asunder. The only difference is, our Line is supported by Stakes, and theirs is buoyed up with Gourds.</p>

They have a vast variety of it, several sorts of which, I have not yet mention'd, as Beaver, Otter, Squirrels, Partridges, Pigeons, and an infinite number of small Birds, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>§. 93. The admirable Oeconomy of the Beavers, deserves to be particularly remember'd. They cohabit in one House, are incorparated in a regular Form of Government, something like Monarchy, and have over them a Superintendent, which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> call <hi rend="italics">Pericu.</hi> He leads them out to their several Imployments, which consist in Felling of Trees, biting off the Branches, and cutting them into certain lengths, suitable to the business they design them for, all which they perform with their Teeth. When this is done, the Governor orders several of his Subjects to joyn together, and take up one of those Logs, which they must carry to their House or Damm, as occasion requires. He walks in State by them all the while, and sees that every one bear
<pb n="75"/>
his equal share of the burden; while he bites with his Teeth, and lashes with his Tail, those that lag behind, and do not lend all their Strength. They commenly build their Houses in Swamps, and then to raise the Water to a convenient height, they make a Damm with Logs, and a binding sort of Clay, so firm, that though the Water runs continually over, it cannot wash it away. Within these Damms, they'l inclose Water enough to make a Pool, like a Mill-pond; and if a Mill happen to be built upon the same Stream, below their Damm, the Miller in a dry Season, finds it worth his while to cut it, to supply his Mill with Water. Upon which Disaster, the Beavers are so expert at their Work, that in one or two Nights time, they will repair the breach, and make it perfectly whole again. Sometimes they build their Houses in a broad Marsh, where the Tide ebbs and flows, and then they make no Damm at all. The Doors into their Houses are under Water. I have been at the Demolishing one of these Houses, that was found in a Marsh, and was surpriz'd to find it fortify'd with Logs, that were six Foot long, and ten Inches through, and had been carried at least one hundred and fifty yards. This House was three Stories high, and contain'd five Rooms, that is to say, two in the lower, and middle Stories, and but one at the top. These Creatures have a great deal of Policy, and know how to defeat all the Subtilty and Stratagems of the Hunter, who seldom can meet with them, tho' they are in great numbers all over the Country.</p>

                        <p>§. 94. There is yet another kind of Sport, which the young People take great Delight in, and that is, the Hunting of wild Horses; which they pursue sometimes with Dogs, and sometimes
<pb n="76"/>
without. You must know they have many Horses foaled in the Woods of the Uplands, that never were in hand, and are as shy as any Savage Creature. These having no mark upon them, belong to him, that first takes them. However, the Captor commonly purchases these Horses very dear, by spoiling better in the pursuit; in which case, he has little to make himself amends, besides the pleasure of the Chace. And very often this is all he has for it, for the wild Horses are so swift, that 'tis difficult to catch them; and when they are taken, tis odds but their Grease is melted, or else being old, they are so sullen, that they can't be tam'd.</p>

A Stranger has no more to do, but to inquire upon the Road, where any Gentleman, or good Housekeeper Lives, and there he may depend upon being received with Hospitality. This good Nature is so general among their People, that the Gentry when they go abroad, order their Principal Servant to entertain all Visitors, with every thing the Plantation affords. And the poor Planters, who have but one Bed, will very often sit up, or lie upon a Form or Couch all Night, to make room for a weary Traveller, to repose himself after his Journey.</p>

But I must confess, (and am heartily sorry for the occasion) that this good Neighbourhood has of late been much depraved by the present Governor, who practices, the detestable Politicks of governing

THE extream fruitfulness of that Country, has been sufficiently shewn in the Second Book, and I think we may justly add, that in that particularly it is not exceeded by any other. No Seed is Sowed there, but it thrives, and most Plants are improved, by being Transplanted thither. And yet there's very little Improvement made among them, nor any thing us'd in Traffique, but Tobacco.</p>
                        <p>Besides all the natural Productions mention'd in the Second Book, you may take notice, that Apples from the Seed, never degenerate into Crabs, or Wildings there, but produce the same, or better Fruit than the Mother-Tree, (which is not so in <hi rend="italics">England,)</hi> and are wonderfully improved by Grafting and Managing; yet there are very few Planters that graft at all, and much fewer that take any care to get choice Fruits.</p>
                        <p>The Fruit-Trees are wonderfully quick of growth, so that in six or seven years time from the Planting, a Man may bring an Orchard to bear in great plenty, from which he may make store of good Cyder, or distill great quantities of Brandy; for the Cyder is very strong, and yields abundance of in Spirit. Yet they have
<pb n="78"/>
very few, that take any care at all for an Orchard; nay, many that have good Orchards, are so negligent of them, as to let them go to ruine, and expose the Trees to be torn, and barked by the Cattle.</p>
                        <p>Peaches, Nectarines, and Apricocks, as well as Plums and Cherries, grow there upon Standard Trees. They commonly bear in three years from the Stone, and thrive so exceedingly, that they seem to have no need of Grafting or Inoculating, if any Body would be so good a Husband; and truly I never heard of any that did Graft either Plum, Nectarine, Peach or Apricock in that Country.</p>
                        <p>Peaches and Nectarines I believe to be Spontaneous some-where or other on that Continent; for the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have, and ever had greater variety, and finer sorts of them than the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi> The best sort of these cling to the Stone, and will not come off clear, which they call Plum-Nectarines, and Plum-Peaches, or Cling-Stones. Some of these are 12 or 13 Inches in the Girt. These sorts of Fruits are raised so easily there, that some good Husbands plant great Orchards of them, purposely for their Hogs; and others make a Drink of them, which they call Mobby, and either drink it as Cyder, or Distil it off for Brandy. This makes the best Spirit next to Grapes.</p>
                        <p>Grape Vines of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Stock, as well as those of their own Production, bear most abundantly, if they are suffered to run near the Ground, and increase very kindly by Slipping; yet very few have them at all in their Gardens, much less indeavour to improve them by cutting or laying. Indeed my Curiosity the last year, caused me to lay some of the white Muscadine, which came of a Stock removed thither from <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and they increased by this method
<pb n="79"/>
to Admiration: I likewise set several Slips of the cuttings of the same Vine, and the Major part of the Sets bore Grapes in perfection the first year, I remember I had seven full Bunches from one of them.</p>
                        <p>When a single Tree happens in clearing the Ground, to be left standing with a Vine upon it, open to the Sun and Air; that Vine generally produces as much as 4 or five others, that remain in the Woods. I have seen in this case, more Grapes upon one single Vine, than wou'd load a <hi rend="italics">London</hi> Cart. And for all this, the People never remove any of them into their Gardens, but content themselves throughout the whole Country, with the Grapes they find thus wild; much less can they be expected to attempt the making of Wine or Brandy from the Grape.</p>
                        <p>The Almond, Pomgranate and Fig, ripen there very well, and yet there are not ten People in the Country, that have any of them in their Gardens much less endeavour to preserve any of them for future spending, or to propagate them to make a Trade.</p>
                        <p>A Garden is no where sooner made than there, either for Fruits, or Flowers. Tulips from the Seed-flower the second year at farthest.

And yet they han't many Gardens in the Country, fit to bear that name.</p>

                        <p>§. 97. All sorts of <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Grain thrive, and increase there, as well as in any other part of the World as for Example, Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Peas, Rape, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> And yet they don't make a Trade of any of them. Their Peas indeed, are troubled with Wivels, which eat a
<pb n="80"/>
Hole in them: But this Hole does neither dammage the Seed, nor make the Peas, unfit for Boiling. And such as are sow'd late, and gather'd after <hi rend="italics">August,</hi> are clear of that Inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>It is thought too much for the same Man, to make the Wheat, and grind it, bolt it, and bake it himself. And it is too great a charge for every Planter, who is willing to sow Barley, to build a Malt-House, and Brew-House too, or else to have no benefit of his Barley; nor will it answer, if he wou'd be at the Charge. These things can never be expected from a single Family: But if they had cohabitations, it might be thought worth attempting. Neither as they are now settled, can they find any certain Market for their other Grain, which if they had Towns, would be quite otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Rice has been tried there, and is found to grow as well, as in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> or in any other part of the Earth: But it labours under the same inconvenience, the want of a Community, to husk and clean it; and after all, to take it off the Planters Hands.</p>

                        <p>§. 98. I have related at large in the first Book, how Flax, Hemp, Cotton, and the Silk Worms have thriven there, in the several essays made upon them; how formerly there was Incouragement given for making of Linnen, Silk, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> and how all Persons not performing several things towards produceing of them were put under a Fine: But now all Incouragement of such things is taken away, and People are not only suffer'd to neglect them, but such as do go about them, are discouraged by their Governor, according to the Maxim laid down in the Memorials before recited.</p>

                        <p>Silk-grass is there spontaneous in many places, and may be cut several times in a Year. I need not mention what Advantage may be made of so useful a Plant, whose Fibres are as fine as Flax, and much stronger than Hemp. Mr. <hi rend="italics">Purchas</hi> tells us, in his <hi rend="italics">Fourth Pilgrim,</hi> Page 1786, That in the first Discovery of this part of the World, they presented Q. <hi rend="italics">Elizabeth</hi> with a Piece of Grogram that had been made of it. And yet to this Day they make no manner of use of this Plant, no, not so much as the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> did, before the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> came among them, who then made their Baskets, Fishing Nets, and Lines, of it.</p>

                        <p>§. 99. The Sheep increase well, and bear good Fleeces, but they generally are suffer'd to be torn off their Backs by Briers, and Bushes, instead of being shorn, or else are left rotting upon the Dunghil with their Skins.</p>
                        <p>Bees thrive there abundantly, and will very easily yield to the careful Huswife, two Crops of Honey in a Year, and besides lay up a Winterstore sufficient to preserve their Stocks.</p>
                        <p>The Beeves, when any Care is taken of them in the Winter, come to great Perfection. They have noble Marshes there, which, with the Charge of draining only, would make as fine Pastures as any in the World; and yet there is not an hundred Acres of Marsh drained throughout the whole Country.</p>
                        <p>Hogs swarm like Vermine upon the Earth, and are often accounted such, insomuch that when an Inventory of any considerable Man's Estate is taken by the Executors, the Hogs are left out, and not listed in the Appraisement. The Hogs run where they list, and find their own Support in the Woods, without any Care of the Owner; and in many Plantations it is
<pb n="82"/>
well, if the Proprietor can find and catch the Pigs, or any part of a Farrow, when they are young, to mark them; for if there be any markt in a Gang of Hogs, they determine the Property of the rest, because they seldom miss their Gangs; but as they are bred in Company, so they continue to the End.</p>

                        <p>§. 100. The Woods produce great Variety of Incense and sweet Gums, which distil from several Trees; as also Trees bearing Honey, and Sugar, as before was mention'd: Yet there's no use made of any of them, either for Profit or Refreshment.</p>
                        <p>All sorts of Naval Stores may be produced there, as Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Turpentine, Plank, Timber, and all sorts of Masts, and Yards, besides Sails, Cordage, and Iron, and all these may be transported, by an easy Water-Carriage.</p>

                        <p>§. 101. These and a Thousand other Advantages that Country naturally affords, which its Inhabitants make no manner of use of. They can see their Naval Stores daily benefit other People, who send thither to build Ships; while they, instead of promoting such Undertakings among themselves, and easing such as are willing to go upon them, allow them no manner of Encouragement, but rather the contrary. They receive no Benefit nor Refreshment from the Sweets, and precious things they have growing amongst them, but make use of the Industry of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> for all such things.</p>
                        <p>What Advantages do they see the Neighbouring Plantations make of their Grain and Provisions, while they, who can produce them infinitely better, not only neglect the making a Trade thereof, but even a necessary Provision against an accidental Scarcity, contenting themselves
<pb n="83"/>
with a supply of Food from hand to mouth, so that if it should please God, to send them an unseasonable Year, there wou'd not be found in the Country, Provision sufficient to support the People for three Months extraordinary.</p>
                        <p>By reason of the unfortunate Method of the Settlement, and want of Cohabitation, they cannot make a beneficial use of their Flax, Hemp, Cotten, Silk, Silk-grass, and Wool, which might otherwise supply their Necessities, and leave the Produce of Tobacco to enrich them, when a gainful Market can be found for it.</p>
                        <p>Thus they depend altogether upon the Liberality of Nature, without endeavouring to improve its Gifts, by Art or Industry. They spunge upon the Blessings of a warm Sun, and a fruitful Soil, and almost grutch the Pains of gathering in the Bounties of the Earth. I should be asham'd to publish this slothful Indolence of my Countrymen, but that I hope it will rouse them out of their Lethargy, and excite them to make the most of all those happy Advantages which Nature has given them; and if it does this, I am sure they will have the Goodness to forgive me.</p>
