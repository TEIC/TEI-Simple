                  <head>“DE HINE FOOT ER A HE FRAWG”</head>
                  <p>TOWARD the close of an early summer afternoon, a 
little girl came running along the turnpike to where a 
boy stood wriggling his feet in the dust.</p>
                  <p>“Old Aunt Ailsey's done come back,” she panted, 
“an' she's conjured the tails off Sambo's sheep. I saw 
'em hanging on her door!”</p>
                  <p>The boy received the news with an indifference 
from which it blankly rebounded. He buried one hare 
foot in the soft white sand and withdrew it with a jerk 
that powdered the blackberry vines beside the way.</p>
                  <p>“Where's Virginia?” he asked shortly.</p>
                  <p>The little girl sat down in the tall grass by the 
roadside and shook her red curls from her eyes. She 
gave a breathless gasp and began fanning herself with 
the flap of her white sunbonnet. A fine moisture shone 
on her bare neck and arms above her frock of sprigged 
chintz calico.</p>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <p>“She can't run a bit,” she declared warmly, peering 
into the distance of the long white turnpike. “I'm a long 
ways ahead of her, and I gave her the start. Zeke's with 
her.”</p>
                  <p>With a grunt the boy promptly descended from his 
heavy dignity.</p>
                  <p>“You can't run,” he retorted. “I'd like to see a 
girl run, anyway.” He straightened his legs and thrust his 
hands into his breeches pockets. “You can't run,” he 
repeated.</p>
                  <p>The little girl flashed a clear defiance; from a
pair of beaming hazel eyes she threw him a scornful challenge. 
“I bet I can beat you,” she stoutly rejoined. Then as the 
boy's glance fell upon her hair, her defiance waned. She 
put on her sunbonnet and drew it down over her brow. 
“I reckon I can run some,” she finished uneasily.</p>
                  <p>The boy followed her movements with a candid 
stare. “You can't hide it,” he taunted; “it shines right 
through everything. O Lord, ain't I glad my head's not 
red!”</p>
                  <p>At this pharisaical thanksgiving the little girl flushed 
to the ruffled brim of her bonnet. Her sensitive lips 
twitched, and she sat meekly gazing past the boy at the 
wall of rough gray stones which skirted a field of 
ripening wheat. Over the wheat a light wind blew, 
fanning the even heads of the bearded grain and 
dropping suddenly against the sunny mountains in the 
distance. In the nearer pasture, where the long grass 
was strewn with wild flowers, red and white cattle were 
grazing beside a little stream, and the tinkle of the cow 
bells drifted faintly across the slanting sunrays. It was 
open
			
<pb n="3"/>
country, with a peculiar quiet cleanliness about its long 
white roads and the genial blues and greens of its 
meadows.</p>
                  <p>“Ain't I glad, O Lord!” chanted the boy again.
The little girl stirred impatiently, her gaze fluttering 
from the landscape.</p>
                  <p>“Old Aunt Ailsey's conjured all the tails off Sambo's 
sheep,”she remarked, with feminine wile. “I saw 'em 
hanging on her door.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, shucks!  she can't conjure!” scoffed the boy.              
“She's nothing but a free nigger, anyway—and besides, 
she's plum crazy—”</p>
                  <p>“I saw 'em hanging on her door,” steadfastly 
repeated the little girl. “The wind blew 'em right out, 
an' there they were.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, they wan't Sambo's sheep tails,” retorted the 
boy, conclusively,“'cause Sambo's sheep ain't got any 
tails.”</p>
                  <p>Brought to bay, the little girl looked doubtfully up 
and down the turnpike. “Maybe she conjured 'em <hi rend="italics">on </hi>
first,” she suggested at last.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you're a regular baby, Betty,” exclaimed the 
boy, in disgust. “You'll be saying next that she can 
make rattlesnake's teeth sprout out of the ground.”</p>
                  <p>“She's got a mighty funny garden patch,” admitted 
Betty, still credulous. Then she jumped up and ran 
along the road. “Here's Virginia!” she called sharply, 
“an' I beat her! I beat her fair!”</p>
                  <p>A second little girl came panting through the dust, 
followed by a small negro boy with a shining black 
face. “There's a wagon comin' roun' the curve,” she 
cried excitedly, “an' it's filled with old Mr.
<pb n="4"/>
Willis's servants. He's dead, and they're sold—Dolly's 
sold, too.”</p>
                  <p>She was a fragile little creature, coloured like a 
flower, and her smooth brown hair hung in silken braids 
to her sash. The strings of her white pique bonnet lined 
with pink were daintily tied under her oval chin; there 
was no dust on her bare legs or short white socks.</p>
                  <p>As she spoke there came the sound of voices singing, 
and a moment later the wagon jogged heavily round a 
tuft of stunted cedars which jutted into the long curve of 
the highway. The wheels crunched a loose stone in the 
road, and the driver drawled a patient “gee-up” to the 
horses, as he flicked at a horse-fly with the end of his 
long rawhide whip. There was about him an almost 
cosmic good nature; he regarded the landscape, the 
horses and the rocks in the road with imperturbable 
ease.</p>
                  <p>Behind him, in the body of the wagon, the negro 
women stood chanting the slave's farewell; and as they 
neared the children, he looked back and spoke 
persuasively.  “I'd set down if I was you all,” he said.  
“You'd feel better. Thar, now, set down and jolt 
softly.”</p>
                  <p>But without turning the women kept up their 
tremulous chant, bending their turbaned heads to the 
imaginary faces upon the roadside. They had left their 
audience behind them on the great plantation, but they 
still sang to the empty road and courtesied to the cedars 
upon the way. Excitement gripped them like a 
frenzy—and a childish joy in a coming change blended 
with a mother's yearning over broken ties.</p>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <p>A bright mulatto led, standing at full height, and her 
rich notes rolled like an organ beneath the shrill plaint 
of her companions. She was large, deep-bosomed, and 
comely after her kind, and in her careless gestures there 
was something of the fine fervour of the artist. She sang 
boldly, her full body rocking from side to side, her 
bared arms outstretched, her long throat swelling like a 
bird's above the gaudy handkerchief upon her breast.</p>
                  <p>The others followed her, half artlessly, half in 
imitation, mingling with their words grunts of 
self-approval. A grin ran from face to face as if thrown 
by the grotesque flash of a lantern. Only a little black 
woman crouching in one corner bowed herself and 
wept.</p>
                  <p>The children had fallen back against the stone wall, 
where they hung staring.</p>
                  <p>“Good-by, Dolly!” they called cheerfully, and the 
woman answered with a long-drawn, hopeless whine: -</p>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Zeke broke from the group and ran a few steps beside 
the wagon, shaking the outstretched hands.</p>
                  <p>The driver nodded peaceably to him, and cut with a 
single stroke of his whip an intricate figure in the sand 
of the road. “Git up an' come along with us, sonny,”
he said cordially; but Zeke only grinned in reply, and 
the children laughed and waved their handkerchiefs 
from the wall. “Good-by, Dolly, and Mirandy, and 
Sukey Sue!” they
<pb n="6"/>
shouted, while the women, bowing over the rolling 
wheels, tossed back a fragment of the song: -</p>

                  <p>“Twel we meet agin,” chirped the little girls, 
tripping into the chorus.</p>
                  <p>Then, with a last rumble, the wagon went by, and 
Zeke came trotting back and straddled the stone wall, 
where he sat looking down upon the loose poppies that 
fringed the yellowed edge of the wheat.</p>
                  <p>“Dey's gwine way-way f'om hyer, Marse Champe,” 
he said dreamily. “Dey's gwine right spang over dar

                  <p>“Colonel Minor bought 'em,” Champe explained, 
sliding from the wall, “and he bought Dolly dirt 
cheap—I heard Uncle say so—”With a grin he looked up 
at the small black figure perched upon the crumbling 
stones. “You'd better look out how you steal any more of 
my fishing lines, or I'll sell you,” he threatened.</p>
                  <p>“Gawd er live! I ain' stole one on 'em sence las' 
mont',” protested Zeke, as he turned a somersault into 
the road, “en dat warn' stealin'  'case hit warn' wu'th it,” 
he added, rising to his feet and staring wistfully after the 
wagon as it vanished in a sunny cloud of dust.</p>
                  <p>Over the broad meadows, filled with scattered wild 
flowers, the sound of the chant still floated, with a 
shrill and troubled sweetness. upon the wind.
<pb n="7"/>		
As he listened the little negro broke into a jubilant 
refrain, beating his naked feet in the dust: -</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Gawd A'moughty bless you twel we</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Then he looked slyly up at his young master.</p>
                  <p>“I 'low dar's one thing you cyarn do, Marse 
Champe.”</p>
                  <p>“I bet there isn't,” retorted Champe.</p>
                  <p>“You kin sell me ter Marse Minor—but Lawd, Lawd, 
you cyarn mek mammy leave off whuppin' me. You 
cyarn do dat widout you 'uz a real ole marster hese'f.”</p>
                  <p>“I reckon I can,” said Champe, indignantly. “I'd just 
like to see her lay hands on you again. I can make 
mammy leave off whipping him, can't I, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>But Betty, with a toss of her head, took her revenge.</p>
                  <p>“'Tain't so long since yo' mammy whipped you,” she 
rejoined. “An' I reckon 'tain't so long since you needed 
it.”</p>
                  <p>As she stood there, a spirited little figure, in a patch 
of faint sunshine, her hair threw a halo of red gold 
about her head. When she smiled—and she smiled now, 
saucily enough—her eyes had a trick of narrowing until 
they became mere beams of light between her lashes. 
Her eyes would smile, though her lips were as prim as 
a preacher's.</p>
                  <p>Virginia gave a timid pull at Betty's frock. 
“Champe's goin' home with us,” she said, “his uncle 
told him to—You're goin' home with us, ain't you, 
Champe?”</p>
                  <p>“I ain't goin' home,” responded Betty, jerking
<pb n="8"/>							
from Virginia's grasp. She stood warm yet resolute in 
the middle of the road, her bonnet swinging in her 
hands. “I ain't goin' home,” she repeated.</p>
                  <p>Turning his back squarely upon her, Champe broke 
into a whistle of unconcern. “You'd just better come 
along,” he called over his shoulder as he started off. 
“You'd just better come along, or you'll catch it.”</p>
                  <p>“I ain't comin',” answered Betty, defiantly, and as 
they passed away kicking the dust before them, she 
swung her bonnet hard, and spoke aloud to herself. “I 
ain't comin',” she said stubbornly.</p>
                  <p>The distance lengthened; the three small figures 
passed the wheat field, stopped for an instant to gather 
green apples that had fallen from a stray apple tree, and 
at last slowly dwindled into the white streak of the road. 
She was alone on the deserted turnpike.</p>
                  <p>For a moment she hesitated, caught her breath, and 
even took three steps on the homeward way; then 
turning suddenly she ran rapidly in the opposite 
direction. Over the deepening shadows she sped as 
lightly as a hare.</p>
                  <p>At the end of a half mile, when her breath came in 
little pants, she stopped with a nervous start and looked 
about her. The loneliness seemed drawing closer like a 
mist, and the cry of a whip-poor-will from the little 
stream in the meadow sent frightened thrills, like 
needles, through her limbs.</p>
                  <p>Straight ahead the sun was setting in a pale red west, 
against which the mountains stood out as if sculptured 
in stone. On one side swept the pasture where a few 
sheep browsed; on the other, at
<pb n="9"/>											
the place where two roads met, there was a blasted tree 
that threw its naked shadow across the turnpike. 
Beyond the tree and its shadow a well-worn foot-path 
led to a small log cabin from which a streak of smoke 
was rising. Through the open door the single room 
within showed ruddy with the blaze of resinous pine.</p>
                  <p>The little girl daintily picked her way along the 
foot-path and through a short garden patch planted in 
onions and black-eyed peas. Beside a bed of sweet sage 
she faltered an instant and hung back. “Aunt Ailsey,” 
she called tremulously, “I want to speak to you, Aunt 
Ailsey.” She stepped upon the smooth round stone 
which served for a doorstep and looked into the room. 
“It's me, Aunt Ailsey!  It's Betty Ambler,” she said.</p>
                  <p>A slow shuffling began inside the cabin, and an old 
negro woman hobbled presently to the daylight and 
stood peering from under her hollowed palm. She was 
palsied with age and blear-eyed with trouble, and time 
had ironed all the kink out of the thin gray locks that 
straggled across her brow. She peered dimly at the child 
as one who looks from a great distance.</p>
                  <p>“I lay dat's one er dese yer ole hoot owls,” she 
muttered querulously, “en ef'n 'tis, he des es well be 
a-hootin' along home, caze I ain' gwine be pestered wid 
his pranks. Dar ain' but one kind er somebody es will 
sass you at yo' ve'y do,' en dat's a hoot owl es is done 
loss count er de time er day—”</p>
                  <p>“I ain't an owl, Aunt Ailsey,” meekly broke in Betty, 
“an' I ain't hootin' at you—”</p>
                  <p>Aunt Ailsey reached out and touched her hair.</p>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <p>“You ain' none er Marse Peyton's chile,” she said. 
“I'se done knowed de Amblers sence de fu'st one er dem 
wuz riz, en dar ain' never been a'er Ambler wid a carrot 
haid—”</p>
                  <p>The red ran from Betty's curls into her face, but she 
smiled politely as she followed Aunt Ailsey into the 
cabin and sat down in a split-bottomed chair upon the 
hearth. The walls were formed of rough, unpolished 
logs, and upon them, as against an unfinished 
background, the firelight threw reddish shadows of the 
old woman and the child. Overhead, from the uncovered 
rafters, hung several tattered sheepskins, and around the 
great fireplace there was a fringe of dead snakes and 
lizards, long since as dry as dust. Under the blazing 
logs, which filled the hut with an almost unbearable 
heat, an ashcake was buried beneath a little gravelike 
mound of ashes.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Ailsey took up a corncob pipe from the stones 
and fell to smoking. She sank at once into a senile 
reverie, muttering beneath her breath with short, 
meaningless grunts. Warm as the summer evening was, 
she shivered before the glowing logs.</p>
                  <p>For a time the child sat patiently watching the 
embers; then she leaned forward and touched the old 
woman's knee. “Aunt Ailsey, O Aunt Ailsey!”</p>
                  <p>Aunt Ailsey stirred wearily and crossed her swollen 
feet upon the hearth.</p>
                  <p>“Dar ain' nuttin' but a hoot owl dat'll sass you ter yo' 
face,” she muttered, and, as she drew her pipe from her 
mouth, the gray smoke circled about her head.</p>
                  <p>The child edged nearer. “I want to speak to you, 
Aunt Ailsey,” she said.  She seized the withered
<pb n="11"/>										
hand and held it close in her own rosy ones. “I want 
you—O Aunt Ailsey, listen! I want you to conjure my 
hair coal black.”</p>
                  <p>She finished with a gasp, and with parted lips sat 
waiting. “Coal black, Aunt Ailsey!” she cried again.</p>
                  <p>A sudden excitement awoke in the old woman's face; 
her hands shook and she leaned nearer. “Hi! who dat 
done tole you I could conjure, honey?” she demanded.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you can, I know you can. You conjured back 
Sukey's lover from Eliza Lou, and you conjured all the 
pains out of Uncle Shadrach's leg.” She fell on her 
knees and laid her head in the old woman's lap.            
“Conjure quick and I won't holler,” she said.</p>
                  <p>“Gawd in heaven!” exclaimed Aunt Ailsey. Her dim 
old eyes brightened as she gently stroked the child's 
brow with her palsied fingers. “Dis yer ain' no way ter 
conjure, honey,” she whispered. “You des wait twel de 
full er de moon, w'en de devil walks de big road.” She 
was wandering again after the fancies of dotage, but 
Betty threw herself upon her. “Oh, change it!  change 
it!” cried the child. “Beg the devil to come and change 
it quick.”</p>
                  <p>Brought back to herself, Aunt Ailsey grunted and 
knocked the ashes from her pipe. “I ain' gwine ter ax 
no favors er de devil,” she replied sternly. “You des 
let de devil alont en he'll let you alont. I'se done 
been young, en I'se now ole, en I ain' never seed de 
devil stick his mouf in anybody's bizness  'fo'  he's 
axed.”</p>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <p>She bent over and raked the ashes from her cake with 
a lightwood splinter.  “Dis yer's gwine tase moughty 
flat-footed,” she grumbled as she did so.</p>
                  <p>“O Aunt Ailsey,” wailed Betty in despair. The tears 
shone in her eyes and rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>“Dar now,” said Aunt Ailsey, soothingly, “you des 
set right still en wait twel ter-night at de full er de 
moon.” She got up and took down one of the crumbling 
skins from the chimney-piece. “Ef'n de hine foot er a he 
frawg cyarn tu'n yo' hyar decent,” she said, “dar ain' 
nuttin' de Lawd's done made es 'll do hit. You des wrop 
er hank er yo' hyar roun' de hine foot, honey, en' w'en de 
night time done come, you teck'n hide it unner a rock in

parts—he gwine tase dat ar frawg foot a mile off.”</p>
                  <p>“A mile off?” repeated the child, stretching out her 
hands.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, Lawd, he gwine tase dat ar frawg foot a mile 
off, en w'en he tase hit, he gwine begin ter sniff en ter 
snuff. He gwine sniff en he gwine snuff, en he gwine 
sniff en he gwine snuff twel he run right spang agin de 
rock in de middle er de road. Den he gwine paw en paw 
twel he root de rock clean up.”</p>
                  <p>The little girl looked up eagerly.</p>
                  <p>“An' my hair, Aunt Ailsey?”</p>
                  <p>“De devil he gwine teck cyar er yo' hyar, honey. 
W'en he come a-sniffin' en a-snuffin' roun' de rock in de 
big road, he gwine spit out flame en smoke en yo' hyar

<pb n="13"/>									
right black. Fo' de sun up yo' haid's gwine ter be es 
black es a crow's foot.”</p>
                  <p>The child dried her tears and sprang up. She tied the 
frog's skin tightly in her handkerchief and started 
toward the door; then she hesitated and looked back.  
“Were you alive at the flood, Aunt Ailsey?” she politely 
inquired.</p>
                  <p>“Des es live es I is now, honey.”</p>
                  <p>“Then you must have seen Noah and the ark and all 
the animals?”</p>
                  <p>“Des es plain es I see you. Marse Noah? Why, I'se 
done wash en i'on Marse Noah's shuts twel I 'uz right 
stiff in de j'ints. He ain' never let nobody flute his frills 
fur 'im 'cep'n' me. Lawd, Lawd, Marse Peyton's shuts 
warn' nuttin ter Marse Noah's!”</p>
                  <p>Betty's eyes grew big. “I reckon you're mighty old, 
Aunt Ailsey—'most as old as God, ain't you?”</p>
                  <p>Aunt Ailsey pondered the question. “I ain' sayin' 
dat, honey,” she modestly replied.</p>
                  <p>“Then you're certainly as old as the devil—you must 
be,” hopefully suggested the little girl.</p>
                  <p>The old woman wavered. “Well, de devil, he ain' 
never let on his age,” she said at last; “but w'en I fust 
lay eyes on 'im, he warn' no mo'n a brat.”</p>
                  <p>Standing upon the threshold for an instant, the child 
reverently regarded her. Then, turning her back upon 
the fireplace and the bent old figure, she ran out into 
the twilight.</p>

                  <head>AT THE FULL OF THE MOON</head>
                  <p>BY the light of the big moon hanging like a lantern 
in the topmost pine upon a distant mountain, the child 
sped swiftly along the turnpike.</p>
                  <p>It was a still, clear evening, and on the summits of 
the eastern hills a fringe of ragged firs stood out 
illuminated against the sky. In the warm June 
weather the whole land was fragrant from the flower 
of the wild grape.</p>
                  <p>When she had gone but a little way, the noise of 
wheels reached her suddenly, and she shrank into the 
shadow beside the wall. A cloud of dust chased 
toward her as the wheels came steadily on. They 
were evidently ancient, for they turned with a 
protesting creak which was heard long before the 
high, old-fashioned coach they carried swung into 
view—long indeed before the driver's whip cracked 
in the air.</p>
                  <p>As the coach neared the child, she stepped boldly 
out into the road—it was only Major Lightfoot, the 
owner of the next plantation, returning, belated, from 
the town.</p>
                  <p>“W'at you doin' dar, chile?” demanded a stern 
voice from the box, and, at the words, the Major's 
head was thrust through the open window, and his 
long white hair waved in the breeze.</p>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <p>“Is that you, Betty?” he asked, in surprise.  “Why, 
I thought it was the duty of that nephew of mine to see 
you home.”</p>
                  <p>“I wouldn't let him,” replied the child. “I don't like 
boys, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“You don't, eh?” chuckled the Major. “Well, there's 
time enough for that, I suppose. You can make up to 
them ten years hence,—and you'll be glad enough to do 
it then, I warrant you,—but are you all alone, young 
lady?” As Betty nodded, he opened the door and 
stepped gingerly down. “I can't turn the horses' heads, 
poor things,” he explained; “but if you will allow me, I 
shall have the pleasure of escorting you on foot.”</p>
                  <p>With his hat in his hand, he smiled down upon the 
little girl, his face shining warm and red above his 
pointed collar and broad black stock. He was very tall 
and spare, and his eyebrows, which hung thick and 
dark above his Roman nose, gave him an odd 
resemblance to a bird of prey. The smile flashed like an 
artificial light across his austere features.</p>
                  <p>“Since my arm is too high for you,” he said, “will 
you have my hand? Yes, you may drive on, Big 
Abel,” to the driver, “and remember to take out those 
bulbs of Spanish lilies for your mistress. You will find 
them under the seat.”</p>
                  <p>The whip cracked again above the fat old roans, and 
with a great creak the coach rolled on its way.</p>
                  <p>“I—I—if you please, I'd rather you wouldn't,” 
stammered the child.</p>
                  <p>The Major chuckled again, still holding out his 
hand. Had she been eighty instead of eight, the gesture 
could not have expressed more deference.
<pb n="16"/>									
“So you don't like old men any better than boys!” 
he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, yes, sir, I do—heaps,” said Betty. She 
transferred the frog's foot to her left hand, and gave 
him her right one. “When I marry, I'm going to 
marry a very old gentleman—as old as you,” she 
added flatteringly.</p>
                  <p>“You honour me,” returned the Major, with a 
bow; “but there's nothing like youth, my dear, 
nothing like youth.” He ended sadly, for he had 
been a gay young blood in his time, and the 
enchantment of his wild oats had increased as he 
passed further from the sowing of them. He had 
lived to regret both the loss of his gayety and the 
languor of his blood, and, as he drifted further from 
the middle years, he had at last yielded to tranquillity 
with a sigh. In his day he had matched any man in 
Virginia at cards or wine or women—to say nothing 
of horseflesh; now his white hairs had brought him 
but a fond, pale memory of his misdeeds and the 
boast that he knew his world—that he knew all his 
world, indeed, except his wife.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, there's nothing like youth!” he sighed over 
to himself, and the child looked up and laughed.</p>
                  <p>“Why do you say that?” she asked.</p>
                  <p>“You will! know some day,” replied the Major. 
He drew himself erect in his tight black broadcloth, 
and thrust out his chin between the high points of his 
collar. His long white hair, falling beneath his hat, 
framed his ruddy face in silver. “There are the lights 
of Uplands,” he said suddenly, with a wave of his 
hand.</p>
                  <p>Betty quickened her pace to his, and they went on
<pb n="17"/>									
in silence. Through the thick grove that ended at the 
roadside she saw the windows of her home flaming 
amid the darkness. Farther away there were the small 
lights of the negro cabins in the “quarters,” and a great 
one from the barn door where the field hands were 
strumming upon their banjos.</p>
                  <p>“I reckon supper's ready,” she remarked, walking 
faster. “Yonder comes Peter, from the kitchen with the 
waffles.”</p>
                  <p>They entered an iron gate that opened from the road, 
and went up a lane of lilac bushes to the long stuccoed 
house, set with detached wings in a grove of maples.  
“Why, there's papa looking for me,” cried the child, as a 
man's figure darkened the square of light from the hall 
and came between the Doric columns of the portico 
down into the drive.</p>
                  <p>“You won't have to search far, Governor,” called the 
Major, in his ringing voice, and, as the other came up 
to him, he stopped to shake hands. “Miss Betty has 
given me the pleasure of a stroll with her.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, it was like you, Major,” returned the other, 
heartily. “I'm afraid it isn't good for your gout, 
though.”</p>
                  <p>He was a small, soldierly-looking man, with a 
clean-shaven, classic face, and thick, brown hair, 
slightly streaked with gray. Beside the Major's gaunt 
figure he appeared singularly boyish, though he held 
himself severely to the number of his inches, and even 
added, by means of a simplicity almost august, a full 
cubit to his stature. Ten years before he had been 
governor of his state, and to his.
<pb n="18"/>
friends and neighbours the empty honour, at least, 
was still his own.</p>
                  <p>“Pooh! pooh!” the older man protested airily, 
“the gout's like a woman, my dear sir—if you begin 
to humour it, you'll get no rest. If you deny yourself 
a half bottle of port, the other half will soon follow. 
No, no, I say—put a bold foot on the matter. Don't 
give up a good thing for the sake of a bad one, sir. I 
remember my grandfather in England telling me that 
at his first twinge of gout he took a glass of sherry, 
and at the second he took two. ‘What! would you 
have my toe become my master?’ he roared to the 
doctor. ‘I wouldn't give in if it were my whole 
confounded foot, sir!’ Oh, those were ripe days, 
Governor!”</p>
                  <p>“A little overripe for the toe, I fear, Major.” </p>
                  <p>“Well, well, we're sober enough now, sir, sober 
enough and to spare. Even the races are dull things. 
I've just been in to have a look at that new mare 
Tom Bickels is putting on the track, and bless my 
soul, she can't hold a candle to the Brown Bess I ran 
twenty years ago—you don't remember Brown Bess, 
eh, Governor?”</p>
                  <p>“Why, to be sure,” said the Governor. “I can see 
her as if it were yesterday,—and a beauty she was, 
too,—but come in to supper with us, my dear Major; 
we were just sitting down. No, I shan't take an 
excuse—come in, sir, come in.”</p>
                  <p>“No, no, thank you,” returned the Major.             
“Molly's waiting, and Molly doesn't like to wait, you 
know. I got dinner at Merry Oaks tavern by the way, 
and a mighty bad one, too, but the worst thing about 
it was that they actually had the
<pb n="19"/>
impudence to put me at the table with an 
abolitionist. Why, I'd as soon eat with a darkey, sir, 
and so I told him, so I told him!”</p>
                  <p>The Governor laughed, his fine, brown eyes twinkling 
in the gloom. “You were always a man of your word,” 
he said; “so I must tell Julia to mend her views before 
she asks you to dine. She, has just had me draw up my 
will and free the servants. There's no withstanding 
Julia, you know, Major.”</p>
                  <p>“You have an angel,” declared the other, “and 
she gets lovelier every day; my regards to her,—and 
to her aunts, sir. Ah, good night, good night,” and 
with a last cordial gesture he started rapidly upon his 
homeward way.</p>
                  <p>Betty caught the Governor's hand and went with 
him into the house. As they entered the hall, Uncle 
Shadrach, the head butler, looked out to reprimand 
her. “Ef'n anybody 'cep'n Marse Peyton had cotch 
you, you'd er des been lammed,” he grumbled. “An' 
papa was real mad!” called Virginia from the table.</p>
                  <p>“That's jest a story!” cried Betty. Still 
clinging to her father's hand, she entered the dining 
room; “that's jest a story, papa,” she repeated.</p>
                  <p>“No, I'm not angry,” laughed the Governor.          
“There, my dear, for heaven's sake don't strangle me. 
Your mother's the one for you to hang on. Can't you 
see what a rage she's in?”</p>
                  <p>“My dear Mr. Ambler,” remonstrated his wife, 
looking over the high old silver service. She was 
very frail and gentle, and her voice was hardly more 
than a clear whisper. “No, no, Betty, you must
<pb n="20"/>
go up and wash your face first,” she added 
decisively.</p>
                  <p>The Governor sat down and unfolded his napkin, 
beaming hospitality upon his food and his family. He 
surveyed his wife, her two maiden aunts and his 
own elder brother with the ineffable good humour he 
bestowed upon the majestic home-cured ham fresh 
from a bath of Madeira.</p>
                  <p>“I am glad to see you looking so well, my dear,” 
he remarked to his wife, with a courtliness in which 
there was less polish than personality. “Ah, Miss 
Lydia, I know whom to thank for this,” he added, 
taking up a pale tea rosebud from his plate, and 
bowing to one of the two old ladies seated beside his 
wife. “Have you noticed, Julia, that even the roses 
have become more plentiful since your aunts did us 
the honour to come to us?”</p>
                  <p>“I am sure the garden ought to be grateful to Aunt 
Lydia,” said his wife, with a pleased smile, “and the 
quinces to Aunt Pussy,” she added quickly, “for 
they were never preserved so well before.”</p>
                  <p>The two old ladies blushed and cast down their 
eyes, as they did every evening at the same kindly 
by-play. “You know I am very glad to be of use, my 
dear Julia,” returned Miss Pussy, with conscious 
virtue. Miss Lydia, who was tall and delicate and 
bent with the weight of potential sanctity, shook her 
silvery head and folded her exquisite old hands 
beneath the ruffles of her muslin under-sleeves. She 
wore her hair in shining folds beneath her thread-lace 
cap, and her soft brown eyes still threw a youthful 
lustre over the faded pallor of her face.</p>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <p>“Pussy has always had a wonderful talent for 
preserving,” she murmured plaintively. “It makes me 
regret my own uselessness.”</p>
                  <p>“Uselessness!” warmly protested the Governor. “My 
dear Miss Lydia, your mere existence is a blessing to 
mankind. A lovely woman is never useless, eh, Brother 
Bill?”</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bill, a stout and bashful gentleman, who never 
wasted words, merely bowed over his plate, and went 
on with his supper. There was a theory in the family—a 
theory romantic old Miss Lydia still hung hard 
by—that Mr. Bill's peculiar apathy was of a sentimental 
origin. Nearly thirty years before he had made a series 
of mild advances to his second cousin, Virginia 
Ambler—and her early death before their polite vows 
were plighted had, in the eyes of his friends, doomed 
the morose Mr. Bill to the position of a perpetual 
mourner.</p>
                  <p>Now, as he shook his head and helped himself to 
chicken, Miss Lydia sighed in sympathy.</p>
                  <p>“I am afraid Mr. Bill must find us very flippant,” she 
offered as a gentle reproof to the Governor.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bill started and cast a frightened glance across 
the table. Thirty years are not as a day, and, after all, 
his emotion had been hardly more than he would have 
felt for a prize perch that had wriggled from his line 
into the stream. The perch, indeed, would have 
represented more appropriately the passion of his 
life—though a lukewarm lover, he was an ardent 
angler.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, Brother Bill understands us,” cheerfully 
interposed the Governor. His keen eyes had noted
Mr. Bill's alarm as they noted the emptiness of
<pb n="22"/>
Miss Pussy's cup. “By the way, Julia,” he went on 
with a change of the subject, “Major  Lightfoot 
found Betty in the road and brought her home. The 
little rogue had run away.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler filled Miss Pussy's cup and pressed 
Mr. Bill to take a slice of Sally Lunn. “The Major is 
so broken that it saddens me,” she said, when these 
offices of hostess were accomplished. “He has never 
been himself since his daughter ran away, and that 
was—dear me, why that was twelve years ago next 
Christmas. It was on Christmas Eve, you remember, 
he came to tell us. The house was dressed in 
evergreens, and Uncle Patrick was making punch.”</p>
                  <p>“Poor Patrick was a hard drinker,” sighed Miss 
Lydia; “but he was a citizen of the world, my dear.”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, yes, I perfectly recall the evening,” said the 
Governor, thoughtfully. “The young people were 
just forming for a reel and you and I were of them, 
my dear,—it was the year, I remember, that the 
mistletoe was brought home in a cart,—when the 
door opened and in came the Major. ‘Jane has run 
away with that dirty scamp Montjoy,’ he said, and 
was out again and on his horse before we caught the 
words. He rode like a madman that night. I can see 
him now, splashing through the mud with Big Abel 
after him.”</p>
                  <p>Betty came running in with smiling eyes, and 
fluttered into her seat. “I got here before the 
waffles,” she cried. “Mammy said I wouldn't. Uncle 
Shadrach, I got here before you!”</p>
                  <p>“Dat's so, honey,” responded Uncle Shadrach
<pb n="23"/>
from behind the Governor's chair. He was so like 
his master—commanding port, elaborate shirt-front, 
and high white stock—that the Major, in a moment 
of merry-making, had once dubbed him “the 
Governor's silhouette.”</p>
                  <p>“Say your grace, dear,” remonstrated Miss 
Lydia, as the child shook out her napkin.  “It's 
always proper to offer thanks standing, you know. I 
remember your great-grandmother telling me that 
once when she dined at the White House, when her 
father was in Congress, the President forgot to say 
grace, and made them all get up again after they 
were seated. Now, for what are we about—”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, papa thanked for me,” cried Betty. “Didn't 
you, papa?”</p>
                  <p>The Governor smiled; but catching his wife's 
eyes, he quickly forced his benign features into a 
frowning mask.</p>
                  <p>“Do as your aunt tells you, Betty,” said Mrs. 
Ambler, and Betty got up and said grace, while 
Virginia took the brownest waffle. When the 
thanksgiving was ended, she turned indignantly 
upon her sister. “That was just a sly, mean trick!” 
she cried in a flash of temper. “You saw my eye 
on that waffle!”</p>
                  <p>“My dear, my dear,” murmured Miss Lydia.</p>
                  <p>“She's des an out'n out fire bran', dat's w'at she 
is,” said Uncle Shadrach.</p>
                  <p>“Well, the Lord oughtn't to have let her take it 
just as I was thanking Him for it!” sobbed Betty, 
and she burst into tears and left the table, upsetting 
Mr. Bill's coffee cup as she went by.</p>
                  <p>The Governor looked gravely after her, “I'm
<pb n="24"/>
afraid the child is really getting spoiled, Julia,” he 
mildly suggested.</p>
                  <p>“She's getting a—a vixenish,” declared Mr. Bill, 
mopping his expansive white waistcoat.</p>
                  <p>“You des better lemme go atter a twig er willow, 
Marse Peyton,” muttered Uncle Shadrach in the 
Governor's ear.</p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongue, Shadrach,” retorted the 
Governor, which was the harshest command he was 
ever known to give his servants.</p>
                  <p>Virginia ate her waffle and said nothing. When 
she went upstairs a little later, she carried a pitcher 
of buttermilk for Betty's face.</p>
                  <p>“It isn't usual for a young lady to have freckles, 
Aunt Lydia says,” she remarked, “and you must rub 
this right on and not wash it off till morning—and, 
after you've rubbed it well in, you must get down on 
your knees and ask God to mend your temper.”</p>
                  <p>Betty was lying in her little trundle bed, while 
Petunia, her small black maid, pulled off her 
stockings, but she got up obediently and raved her 
face in buttermilk. “I don't reckon there's any use 
about the other,” she said. “I believe the Lord's jest 
leavin' me in sin as a warnin' to you and Petunia,” 
and she got into her trundle bed and waited for the 
lights to go out, and for the watchful Virginia to fall 
asleep.</p>
                  <p>She was still waiting when the door softly 
opened and her mother came in, a lighted candle in 
her hand, the pale flame shining through her profile 
as through delicate porcelain, and illumining her 
worn and fragile figure. She moved with a slow
<pb n="25"/>
step, as if her white limbs were a burden, and her 
head, with its smoothly parted bright brown hair, 
bent like a lily that has begun to fade.</p>
                  <p>She sat down upon the bedside and laid her hand on 
the child's forehead. “Poor little firebrand,” she said 
gently. “How the world will hurt you!”  Then she 
knelt down and prayed beside her, and went out 
again with the white light streaming upon her bosom. 
An hour later Betty heard her soft, slow step on the 
gravelled drive and knew that she was starting on a 
ministering errand to the quarters. Of all the souls on 
the great plantation, the mistress alone had never 
rested from her labours.</p>
                  <p>The child tossed restlessly, beat her pillow, and fell 
back to wait more patiently. At last the yellow strip 
under the door grew dark, and from the other 
trundle bed there came a muffled breathing. With a 
sigh, Betty sat up and listened; then she drew the 
frog's skin from beneath her pillow and crept on 
bare feet to the door. It was black there, and black 
all down the wide, old staircase. The great hall 
below was like a cavern underground. Trembling 
when a board creaked under her, she cautiously felt 
her way with her hands on the balustrade. The front 
door was fastened with an iron chain that rattled as 
she touched it, so she stole into the dining room, 
unbarred one of the long windows, and slipped 
noiselessly out. It was almost like sliding into 
sunshine, the moon was so large and bright.</p>
                  <p>From the wide stone portico, the great white 
columns, looking grim and ghostly, went upward to 
the roof, and beyond the steps the gravelled drive
<pb n="26"/>
shone hard as silver. As the child went between the 
lilac bushes, the moving shadows crawled under her 
bare feet like living things.</p>
                  <p>At the foot of the drive ran the big road, and when 
she came out upon it her trailing gown caught in a 
fallen branch, and she fell on her face. Picking 
herself up again, she sat on a loosened rock and 
looked about her.</p>
                  <p>The strong night wind blew on her flesh, and she 
shivered in the moonlight, which felt cold and 
brazen. Before her stretched the turnpike, darkened 
by shadows that bore no likeness to the objects from 
which they borrowed shape. Far as eye could see, 
they stirred ceaselessly back and forth like an 
encamped army of grotesques.</p>
                  <p>She got up from the rock and slipped the frog's 
skin into the earth beneath it. As she settled it in 
place, her pulses gave a startled leap, and she stood 
terror-stricken beside the stone. A thud of footsteps 
was coming along the road.</p>
                  <p>For an instant she trembled in silence; then her 
sturdy little heart took courage, and she held up her 
hand.</p>
                  <p>“If you'll wait a minute, Mr. Devil, I'm goin' in,” 
she cried.</p>
                  <p>From the shadows a voice laughed at her, and a 
boy came forward into the light—a half-starved boy, 
with a white, pinched face and a dusty bundle 
swinging from the stick upon his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>“What are you doing here?” he snapped out.</p>
                  <p>Betty gave back a defiant stare. She might have 
been a tiny ghost in the moonlight, with her trailing 
gown and her flaming curls.</p>
                  <pb n="27"/>
                  <p>“I live here,” she answered simply. “Where do you 
live?”</p>
                  <p>“Nowhere.” He looked her over with a laugh.</p>
                  <p>“Nowhere?”</p>
                  <p>“I did live somewhere, but I ran away a week 
ago.”</p>
                  <p>“Did they beat you? Old Rainy-day Jones beat 
one of his servants and he ran away.”</p>
                  <p>“There wasn't anybody,” said the boy. “My 
mother died, and my father went off—I hope he'll 
stay off. I hate him!”</p>
                  <p>He sent the words out so sharply that Betty's lids 
flinched.</p>
                  <p>“Why did you come by here?” she questioned.      
“Are you looking for the devil, too?”</p>
                  <p>The boy laughed again. “I am looking for my 
grandfather. He lives somewhere on this road, at a 
place named Chericoke. It has a lot of elms in the 
yard; I'll know it by that.”</p>
                  <p>Betty caught his arm and drew him nearer. “Why, 
that's where Champe lives!” she cried. “I don't like 
Champe much, do you?”</p>
                  <p>“I never saw him,” replied the boy; “but I don't 
like him—”</p>
                  <p>“He's mighty good,” said Betty, honestly; then, as 
she looked at the boy again, she caught her breath 
quickly. “You do look terribly hungry,” she added.</p>
                  <p>“I haven't had anything since—since yesterday.”</p>
                  <p>The little girl thoughtfully tapped her toes on 
the road. “There's a currant pie in the safe,” 
she said. “I saw Uncle Shadrach put it there. Are 
you fond of currant pie?—then you just wait!” </p>
                  <pb n="28"/>
                  <p>She ran up the carriage way to the dining-room 
window, and the boy sat down on the rock and buried 
his face in his hands. His feet were set stubbornly in 
the road, and the bundle lay beside them. He was 
dumb, yet disdainful, like a high-bred dog that has 
been beaten and turned adrift.</p>
                  <p>As the returning patter of Betty's feet sounded in 
the drive, he looked up and held out his hands. When 
she gave him the pie, he ate almost wolfishly, licking 
the crumbs from his fingers, and even picking up a 
bit of crust that had fallen to the ground.</p>
                  <p>“I'm sorry there isn't any more,” said the little 
girl. It had seemed a very large pie when she took it 
from the safe.</p>
                  <p>The boy rose, shook himself, and swung his 
bundle across his arm.</p>
                  <p>“Will you tell me the way?” he asked, and she 
gave him a few childish directions. “You go past the 
wheat field an' past the maple spring, an' at the dead 
tree by Aunt Ailsey's cabin you turn into the road 
with the chestnuts. Then you just keep on till you get 
there—an' if you don't ever get there, come back to 
breakfast.”</p>
                  <p>The boy had started off, but as she ended, he 
turned and lifted his hat.</p>
                  <p>“I am very much obliged to you,” he said, with 
a quaint little bow; and Betty bobbed a courtesy in 
her nightgown before she fled back into the house.</p>

                  <head>III</head>
                  <head>THE COMING OF THE BOY</head>
                  <p>THE boy trudged on bravely, his stick sounding the 
road. Sharp pains ran through his feet where his shoes 
had worn away, and his head was swimming like a top. 
The only pleasant fact of which he had consciousness 
was that the taste of the currants still lingered in his 
mouth.</p>
                  <p>When he reached the maple spring, he swung himself 
over the stone wall and knelt down for a drink, dipping 
the water in his hand. The spring was low and damp 
and fragrant with the breath of mint which grew in 
patches in the little stream. Overhead a wild grapevine 
was festooned, and he plucked a leaf and bent it into a 
cup from which he drank. Then he climbed the wall 
again and went on his way.</p>
                  <p>He was wondering if his mother had ever walked 
along this road on so brilliant a night. There was 
not a tree beside it of which she had not told him 
—not a shrub of sassafras or sumach that she had 
not carried in her thoughts. The clump of cedars, 
the wild cherry, flowering in the spring like snow, 
the blasted oak that stood where the branch roads 
met, the perfume of the grape blossoms on the wall 
—these were as familiar to him as the streets of the 
little crowded town in which he had lived. It was as 
if nature had stood still here for twelve long 
<pb n="30"/>											
summers, or as if he were walking, ghostlike, amid 
the ever present memories of his mother's heart.</p>
                  <p>His mother! He drew his sleeve across his eyes 
and went on more slowly. She was beside him on 
the road, and he saw her clearly, as he had seen her 
every day until last year—a bright, dark woman, 
with slender, blue-veined hands and merry eyes that 
all her tears had not saddened. He saw her in a long, 
black dress, with upraised arm, putting back a crepe 
veil from her merry eyes, and smiling as his father 
struck her. She had always smiled when she was 
hurt—even when the blow was heavier than usual, 
and the blood gushed from her temple, she had fallen 
with a smile. And when, at last, he had seen her 
Iying in her coffin with her baby under her clasped 
hands, that same smile had been fixed upon her face, 
which had the brightness and the chill repose of 
marble.</p>
                  <p>Of all that she had thrown away in her foolish
 marriage, she had retained one thing only—her pride. 
To the end she had faced her fate with all the 
insolence with which she faced her husband. And 
yet—“the Lightfoots were never proud, my son,” 
she used to say; “they have no false pride, but they 
know their place, and in England, between you and 
me, they were more important than the Washingtons. 
Not that the General wasn't a great man, dear, he 
was a very great soldier, of course—and in his 
youth, you know, he was an admirer of your 
Great-great-aunt Emmeline. But she—why, she was 
the beauty and belle of two continents—there's an 
ottoman at home covered with a piece of her 
wedding dress.”</p>
                  <pb n="31"/>
                  <p>And the house? Was the house still as she had left 
it on that Christmas Eve?“ A simple gentleman's 
home, my child—not so imposing as Uplands, with 
its pillars reaching to the roof, but older, oh, much 
older, and built of brick that was brought all the 
way from England, and over the fireplace in the 
panelled parlour you will find the Lightfoot arms.</p>
                  <p>“It was in that parlour, dear, that grandmamma 
danced a minuet with General Lafayette; it looks out, 
you know, upon a white thorn planted by the General 
himself, and one of the windows has not been opened 
for fifty years, because the spray of English ivy your 
Great-aunt Emmeline set out with her own hands has 
grown across the sash. Now the window is quite dark 
with leaves, though you can still read the words Aunt 
Emmeline cut with her diamond ring in one of the tiny 
panes, when young Harry Fitzhugh came in upon her 
just as she had written a refusal to an English earl. She 
was sitting in the window seat with the letter in her 
hand, and, when your Great-uncle Harry—she 
afterwards married him, you know—fell on his knees 
and cried out that others might offer her fame and 
wealth, but that he had nothing except love, she turned, 
with a smile, and wrote upon the pane  ‘Love is best.’ 
You can still see the words, very faint against the ivy 
that she planted on her wedding day—”</p>
                  <p>Oh, yes, he knew it all—Great-aunt Emmeline 
was but the abiding presence of the place. He 
knew the lawn with its grove of elms that overtopped 
the peaked roof, the hall, with its shining
<pb n="32"/>
floor and detached staircase that crooked itself in the 
centre where the tall clock stood, and, best of all, the 
white panels of the parlour where hung the portrait 
of that same fascinating great-aunt, painted, in 
amber brocade, as Venus with the apple in her hand.</p>
                  <p>And his grandmother, herself, in her stiff black 
silk, with a square of lace turned back from her thin 
throat and a fluted cap above her corkscrew curls 
—her daguerreotype, taken in all her pride and her 
precision, was tied up in the bundle swinging on his 
arm.</p>
                  <p>He passed Aunt Ailsey's cabin, and turned into the 
road with the chestnuts. A mile farther he came 
suddenly upon the house, standing amid the grove of 
elms, dwarfed by the giant trees that arched above it. 
A dog's bark sounded snappily from a kennel, but he 
paid no heed. He went up the broad white walk, 
climbed the steps to the square front porch, and 
lifted the great brass knocker. When he let it fall, the 
sound echoed through the shuttered house.</p>
                  <p>The Major, who was sitting in his library with a 
volume of Mr. Addison open before him and a 
decanter of Burgundy at his right hand, heard the 
knock, and started to his feet. “Something's gone 
wrong at Uplands,” he said aloud; “there's an 
illness—or the brandy is out.” He closed the book, 
pushed aside the bedroom candle which he had been 
about to light, and went out into the hall. As he 
unbarred the door and flung it open, he began at 
once:—</p>
                  <p>“I hope there's no ill news,” he exclaimed.</p>
                  <pb n="33"/>
                  <p>The boy came into the hall, where he stood 
blinking from the glare of the lamplight. His head 
whirled, and he reached out to steady himself 
against the door. Then he carefully laid down his 
bundle and looked up with his mother's smile.</p>
                  <p>“You're my grandfather, and I'm very hungry,” 
he said.</p>
                  <p>The Major caught the child's shoulders and drew 
him, almost roughly, under the light. As he towered 
there above him, he gulped down something in his 
throat, and his wide nostrils twitched.</p>
                  <p>“So you're poor Jane's boy?” he said at last.</p>
                  <p>The boy nodded. He felt suddenly afraid of the 
spare old man with his long Roman nose and his 
fierce black eyebrows. A mist gathered before his 
eyes and the lamp shone like a great moon in a 
cloudy circle.</p>
                  <p>The Major looked at the bundle on the floor, and 
again he swallowed. Then he stooped and picked up 
the thing and turned away.</p>
                  <p>“Come in, sir, come in,” he said in a knotty voice. 
“You are at home.”</p>
                  <p>The boy followed him, and they passed the 
panelled parlour, from which he caught a glimpse of 
the painting of Great-aunt Emmeline, and went into 
the dining room, where his grandfather pulled out a 
chair and bade him to be seated. As the old man 
opened the huge mahogany sideboard and brought 
out a shoulder of cold lamb and a plate of bread and 
butter, he questioned him with a quaint courtesy 
about his life in town and the details of his journey. 
“Why, bless my soul, you've walked two hundred 
miles,” he cried, stopping on his way from
<pb n="34"/>
the pantry, with the ham held out. “And no money! 
Why, bless my soul!”</p>
                  <p>“I had fifty cents,” said the boy, “that was left 
from my steamboat fare, you know.”</p>
                  <p>The Major put the ham on the table and attacked 
it grimly with the carving-knife.</p>
                  <p>“Fifty cents,” he whistled, and then, “you 
begged, I reckon?”</p>
                  <p>The boy flushed. “I asked for bread,” he replied, 
stung to the defensive. “They always gave me bread 
and sometimes meat, and they let me sleep in the 
barns where the straw was, and once a woman took 
me into her house and offered me money, but I 
would not take it. I—I think I'd like to send her a 
present, if you please, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“She shall have a dozen bottles of my best 
Madeira,” cried the Major. The word recalled him to 
himself, and he got up and raised the lid of the 
cellaret, lovingly running his hand over the rows of 
bottles.</p>
                  <p>“A pig would be better, I think,” said the boy, 
doubtfully, “or a cow, if you could afford it. She is 
a poor woman, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“Afford it!” chuckled the Major.—“Why, I'll sell 
your grandmother's silver, but I'll afford it, sir.”</p>
                  <p>He took out a bottle, held it against the light, and 
filled a wine glass. “This is the finest port in 
Virginia,” he declared; “there is life in every drop of 
it. Drink it down,” and, when the boy had taken it, he 
filled his own glass and tossed it off, not lingering, 
as usual, for the priceless flavour. “Two hundred 
miles!” he gasped, as he looked at the child
<pb n="35"/>											
with moist eyes over which his red lids half closed.  
“Ah, you're a Lightfoot,” he said slowly. “I should know 
you were a Lightfoot if I passed you in the road.” He 
carved a slice of ham and held it out on the end of the 
knife. “It's long since you've tasted a ham like 
this—browned in bread crumbs,” he added temptingly, 
but the boy gravely shook his head.</p>
                  <p>“I've had quite enough, thank you, sir,” he answered 
with a quaint dignity, not unlike his grandfather's and 
as the Major rose, he stood up also, lifting his black 
head to look in the old man's face with his keen gray 
eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Major took up the bundle and moved toward the 
door. “You must see your grandmother,” he said as 
they went out, and he led the way up the crooked stair 
past the old clock in the bend. On the first landing he 
opened a door and stopped upon the threshold. “Molly, 
here is poor Jane's boy,” he said.</p>
                  <p>In the centre of a big four-post bed, curtained in 
white dimity, a little old lady was lying between 
lavender-scented sheets. On her breast stood a tall silver 
candlestick which supported a well-worn volume of  
“The Mysteries of Udolpho,” held open by a pair of 
silver snuffers. The old lady's face was sharp and 
wizened, and beneath her starched white nightcap rose 
the knots of her red flannel curlers. Her eyes, which 
were very small and black, held a flickering brightness 
like that in live embers.</p>
                  <p>“Whose boy, Mr. Lightfoot?” she asked sharply.</p>
                  <p>Holding the child by the hand, the Major went into 
the room.</p>
                  <pb n="36"/>
                  <p>“It's poor Jane's boy, Molly,” he repeated huskily.</p>
                  <p>The old lady raised her head upon her high pillows, 
and looked at him by the light of the candle on her 
breast. “Are you Jane's boy?” she questioned in 
suspicion, and at the child's “Yes, ma'am,” she said,  
“Come nearer. There, stand between the curtains. Yes, 
you are Jane's boy, I see.” She gave the decision flatly, as 
if his parentage were a matter of her pleasure. “And 
what is your name?” she added, as she snuffed the 
candle.</p>
                  <p>The boy looked from her stiff white nightcap to the  
“log-cabin” quilt on the bed, and then at her steel hoops 
which were hanging from a chair back. He had always 
thought of her as in her rich black silk, with the tight 
gray curls about her ears, and at this revelation of her 
inner mysteries, his fancy received a checkmate.</p>
                  <p>But he met her eyes again and answered simply,  
“Dandridge—they call me Dan—Dan Montjoy.”</p>
                  <p>“And he has walked two hundred miles, Molly,” 
gasped the Major.</p>
                  <p>“Then he must be tired,” was the old lady's rejoinder, 
and she added with spirit: “Mr. Lightfoot, will you 
show Dan to Jane's old room, and see that he has a 
blanket on his bed. He should have been asleep hours 
ago—good night, child, be sure and say your prayers,” 
and as they crossed the threshold, she laid aside her 
book and blew out her light.</p>
                  <p>The Major led the way to “Jane's old room” at the 
end of the hall, and fetched a candle from somewhere 
outside. “I think you'll find everything you
<pb n="37"/>											
need,” he said, stooping to feel the covering on the 
bed. “Your grandmother always keeps the rooms 
ready. God bless you, my son,” and he went out, 
softly closing the door after him.</p>
                  <p>The boy sat down on the steps of the tester bed, 
and looked anxiously round the three-cornered 
room, with its sloping windows filled with small, 
square panes of glass. By the candlelight, flickering 
on the plain, white walls and simple furniture, he 
tried to conjure back the figure of his mother,—
handsome Jane Lightfoot. Over the mantel hung two 
crude drawings from her hand, and on the table at 
the bedside there were several books with her name 
written in pale ink on the fly leaves. The mirror to 
the high old bureau seemed still to hold the outlines 
of her figure, very shadowy against the greenish 
glass. He saw her in her full white skirts—she had 
worn nine petticoats, he knew, on grand 
occasions—fastening her coral necklace about her 
stately throat, the bands of her black hair drawn like 
a veil above her merry eyes. Had she lingered on 
that last Christmas Eve, he wondered, when her 
candlestick held its sprig of mistletoe and her room 
was dressed in holly? Did she look back at the 
cheerful walls and the stately furniture before she 
blew out her light and went downstairs to ride madly 
off, wrapped in his father's coat? And the old people 
drank their eggnog and watched the Virginia reel, 
and, when they found her gone, shut her out forever.</p>
                  <p>Now, as he sat on the bed-steps, it seemed to 
him that he had come home for the first time in his 
life. All this was his own by right,—the queer
<pb n="38"/>										
old house, his mother's room, and beyond the sloping 
windows, the meadows with their annual yield of 
grain. He felt the pride of it swelling within him; he 
waited breathlessly for the daybreak when he might 
go out and lord it over the fields and the cattle and 
the servants that were his also. And at last—his head 
big with his first day's vanity—he climbed between 
the dimity curtains and fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>When he awaked next morning, the sun was 
shining through the small square panes, and outside 
were the waving elm boughs and a clear sky. He was 
aroused by a knock on his door, and, as he jumped 
out of bed, Big Abel, the Major's driver and 
confidential servant, came in with the warm water. 
He was a strong, finely-formed negro, black as the 
ace of spades (so the Major put it), and of a 
singularly open countenance.</p>
                  <p>“Hi! ain't you up yit, young Marster?” he 
exclaimed. “Sis Rhody, she sez she done save you 
de bes' puffovers you ever tase, en ef'n you don' 
come 'long down, dey'll fall right flat.”</p>
                  <p>“Who is Sis Rhody?” inquired the boy, as he 
splashed the water on his face.</p>
                  <p>“Who she? Why, she de cook.”</p>
                  <p>“All right, tell her I'm coming,” and he dressed 
hurriedly and ran down into the hall where he found 
Champe Lightfoot, the Major's great-nephew, who 
lived at Chericoke.</p>
                  <p>“Hello!” called Champe at once, plunging his 
hands into his pockets and presenting an expression 
of eager interest.  “When did you get here?”</p>
                  <p>“Last night,” Dan replied, and they stood staring 
at each other with two pairs of the Lightfoot
gray eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="39"/>
                  <p>“How'd you come?”</p>
                  <p>“I walked some and I came part the way on a 
steamboat. Did you ever see a steamboat?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, shucks! A steamboat ain't anything. I've 
seen George Washington's sword. Do you like to 
fish?”</p>
                  <p>“I never fished. I lived in a city.”</p>
                  <p>Zeke came in with a can of worms, and Champe 
gave them the greater share of his attention. “I tell 
you what, you'd better learn,” he said at last, 
returning the can to Zeke and taking up his 
fishing-rod. “There're a lot of perch down yonder in 
the river,” and he strode out, followed by the small 
negro.</p>
                  <p>Dan looked after him a moment, and then went 
into the dining room, where his grandmother was 
sitting at the head of her table, washing her pink 
teases in a basin of soapsuds. She wore her stiff, 
black silk this morning with its dainty undersleeves 
of muslin, and her gray curls fell beneath her cap 
of delicate yellowed lace. “Come and kiss me, 
child,” she said as he entered. “Did you sleep well?”</p>
                  <p>“I didn't wake once,” answered the boy, kissing 
her wrinkled cheek.</p>
                  <p>“Then you must eat a good breakfast and go to 
your grandfather in the library. Your grandfather is 
a very learned man, Dan, he reads Latin every 
morning in the library.—Cupid, has Rhody a freshly 
broiled chicken for your young master?”</p>
                  <p>She got up and rustled about the room, arranging 
the pink teases behind the glass doors of the 
corner press.  Then she slipped her key basket over
<pb n="40"/>										
her arm and fluttered in and out of the storeroom, 
stopping at intervals to scold the stream of servants 
that poured in at the dining-room door. “Ef'n you 
don' min',  Ole Miss, Paisley, she done got de colick 
f'om a hull pa'cel er green apples,” and “Abram he's 
des a-shakin' wid a chill en he say he cyarn go ter de 
co'n field.”</p>
                  <p>“Wait a minute and be quiet,” the old lady 
responded briskly, for, as the boy soon learned, she 
prided herself upon her healing powers, and suffered 
no outsider to doctor her husband or her slaves.        
“Hush, Silas, don't say a word until I tell you. 
Cupid—you are the only one with any sense—
measure Paisley a dose of Jamaica ginger from the 
bottle on the desk in the office, and send Abram a 
drink of the bitters in the brown jug—why, Car'line, 
what do you mean by coming into the house with a 
slit in your apron?”</p>
                  <p>“Fo' de Lawd, Ole Miss, hit's des done cotch on 
de fence. All de ducks Aun' Meeley been fattenin' up 
fur you done got loose en gone ter water.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you go, too, every one of you!” and she 
dismissed them with waves of her withered, little 
hands. “Send them out, Cupid. No, Car'line, not a 
word. Don't ' Ole Miss ' me, I tell you!” and the 
servants streamed out again as they had come.</p>
                  <p>When he had finished his breakfast the boy went 
back into the hall where Big Abel was taking down 
the Major's guns from the rack, and, as he caught 
sight of the strapping figure and kindly black face, 
he smiled for the first time since his home-coming. 
With a lordly manner, he went over and held out 
his hand.</p>
                  <pb n="41"/>
                  <p>“I like <hi rend="italics">you</hi>, Big Abel,” he said gravely, and he 
followed him out into the yard.</p>
                  <p>For the next few weeks he did not let Big Abel out 
of his sight. He rode with him to the pasture, he sat 
with him on his doorstep of a fine evening, and he 
drove beside him on the box when the old coach 
went out. “Big Abel says a gentleman doesn't go 
barefooted,” he said to Champe when he found him 
without his shoes in the meadow, “and I'm a 
gentleman.”</p>
                  <p>“I'd like to know what Big Abel knows about it,” 
promptly retorted Champe, and Dan grew white 
with rage and proceeded to roll up his sleeves. “I'll 
whip any man who says Big Abel doesn't know a 
gentleman!” he cried, making a lunge at his cousin. 
In point of truth, it was Champe who did the 
whipping in such free fights; but bruises and a 
bleeding nose had never scared the savage out of 
Dan. He would spring up from his last tumble as 
from his first, and let fly at his opponent until Big 
Abel rushed, in tears, between them.</p>
                  <p>From the garrulous negro, the boy soon learned 
the history of his family—learned, indeed, much 
about his grandfather of which the Major himself 
was quite unconscious. He heard of that kindly, 
rollicking early life, half wild and wholly 
good-humoured, in which the eldest male Lightfoot 
had squandered his time and his fortune. Why, was 
not the old coach itself but an existing proof of Big 
Abel's stories?“ 'Twan' mo'n twenty years back dat 
Ole Miss had de fines' car'ige in de county,” he 
began one evening on the doorstep, and the boy 
drove away a brood of half-fledged chickens and
<pb n="42"/>										
settled himself to listen. “Hadn't you better light 
your pipe, Big Abel?” he inquired courteously.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel shuffled into the cabin and came back 
with his corncob pipe and a lighted taper. “We all 
ain' rid in de ole coach den,” he said with a sigh, as 
he sucked at the long stem, and threw the taper at the 
chickens. “De ole coach hit uz th'owed away in de 
out'ouse, en I 'uz des stiddyin' 'bout splittin' it up fer 
kindlin' wood—en de new car'ige hit cos' mos' a mint 
er money. Ole Miss she uz dat sot up dat she ain' let 
de hosses git no sleep—nor me nurr. Ef'n she spy out

been nuttin' like dat ar car'ige in Varginny sence

                  <p>“But where is it, Big Abel?”</p>
                  <p>“You des wait, young Marster, you des wait twel 
I git dar. I'se gwine git dar w'en I come ter de day

                  <p>“‘I ain' tied, Plaintain, I'm tired,’ sez Ole Marster, 
‘I'm tired losin' money.’ Den Marse Plaintain he 
laugh like a devil. ‘Oh, come in, suh, come in en

                  <pb n="44"/>
                  <p>“And Grandma? Did she cry?” asked the boy, 
breathlessly.</p>
                  <p>“Who cry? Ole Miss? Huh! She des th'ow up her

                  <head>A HOUSE WITH AN OPEN DOOR</head>
                  <p>THE master of Uplands was standing upon his portico 
behind the Doric columns, looking complacently over 
the fat lands upon which his fathers had sown and 
harvested for generations. Beyond the lane of lilacs and 
the two silver poplars at the gate, his eyes wandered 
leisurely across the blue green strip of grass-land to the 
tawny wheat field, where the slaves were singing as they 
swung their cradles. The day was fine, and the outlying 
meadows seemed to reflect his gaze with a smile as 
beneficent as his own. He had cast his bread upon the 
soil, and it had returned to him threefold.</p>
                  <p>As he stood there, a small, yet imposing figure, 
in his white duck suit, holding his broad slouch hat 
in his hand, he presented something of the genial aspect
of the country—as if the light that touched the pleasant 
hills and valleys was aglow in his clear brown eyes and 
comely features. Even the smooth white hand in which 
he held his hat and riding-whip had about it a certain 
plump kindliness which would best become a careless 
gesture of concession. And, after all, he looked but 
what he was -a bland and generous gentleman, whose 
heart was as open as his wine cellar.</p>
                  <pb n="46"/>
                  <p>A catbird was singing in one of the silver poplars, 
and he waited, with upraised head, for the song to 
end. Then he stooped beside a column and carefully 
examined a newly planted coral honeysuckle before 
he went into the wide hall, where his wife was seated 
at her work-table.</p>
                  <p>From the rear door, which stood open until frost, a 
glow of sunshine entered, brightening the white walls 
with their rows of antlers and gunracks, and rippling 
over the well-waxed floor upon which no drop of 
water had ever fallen. A faint sweetness was in the 
air from the honeysuckle arbour outside, which led 
into the box-bordered walks of the garden.</p>
                  <p>As the Governor hung up his hat, he began at once 
with his daily news of the farm. “I hope they'll get 
that wheat field done to-day,” he said; “but it doesn't 
look much like it—they've been dawdling over it for 
the last three days. I am afraid Wilson isn't much of 
a manager, after all; if I take my eyes off him, he 
seems to lose his head.”</p>
                  <p>“I think everything is that way,” returned his wife, 
looking up from one of the elaborately tucked and 
hemstitched shirt fronts which served to gratify the 
Governor's single vanity. “I'm sure Aunt Pussy says 
she can't trust Judy for three days in the dairy 
without finding that the cream has stood too long for 
butter—and Judy has been churning for twenty 
years.” She cut off her thread and held the linen out 
for the Governor's inspection. “I really believe that 
is the prettiest one I've made. How do you like this 
new stitch?”</p>
                  <pb n="47"/>
                  <p>“Exquisite!” exclaimed her husband, as he took 
the shirt front in his hand. “Simply exquisite, my 
love. There isn't a woman in Virginia who can do 
such needlework; but it should go upon a younger 
and handsomer man, Julia.”</p>
                  <p>His wife blushed and looked up at him, the colour 
rising to her beautiful brow and giving a youthful 
radiance to her nunlike face. “It could certainly go 
upon a younger man, Mr. Ambler,” she rejoined, 
with a touch of the coquetry for which she had once 
been noted; “but I should like to know where I'd 
find a handsomer one.”</p>
                  <p>A pleased smile broadened the Governor's face, 
and he settled his waistcoat with an approving pat.  
“Ah, you're a partial witness, my dear,” he said
“but I've an error to confess, so I mustn't forego 
your favour—I—I bought several of Mr. Willis's 
servants, my love.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, Mr. Ambler!” remonstrated his wife, 
reproach softening her voice until it fell like a 
caress. “Why, Mr. Ambler, you bought six of 
Colonel Blake's last year, you know and one of the 
house servants has been nursing them ever since. 
The quarters are filled with infirm darkies.”</p>
                  <p>“But I couldn't help it, Julia, I really couldn't,” 
pleaded the Governor. “You'd have done it yourself, 
my dear. They were sold to a dealer going south, 
and one of them wants to marry that Mandy of 
yours.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, if it's Mandy's lover,” broke in Mrs. 
Ambler, with rising interest, “of course you had to 
buy him, and you did right about the others—you 
always do right.” She put out her delicate blue
<pb n="48"/>										
veined hand and touched his arm. “I shall see them 
to-day,” she added, “and Mandy may as well be 
making her wedding dress.”</p>
                  <p>“What an eye to things you have,” said the 
Governor, proudly. “You might have been 
President, had you been a man, my dear.”</p>
                  <p>His wife rose and took up her work-box with a 
laugh of protest. “I am quite content with the 
mission of my sex, sir,” she returned, half in jest, 
half in wifely humility. “I'm sure I'd much rather 
make shirt fronts for you than wear them—myself.” 
Then she nodded to him and went, with her stately 
step, up the broad staircase, her white hand flitting 
over the mahogany balustrade.</p>
                  <p>As he looked after her, the Governor's face 
clouded, and he sighed beneath his breath. The cares 
she met with such serenity had been too heavy for 
her strength; they had driven the bloom from her 
cheeks and the lustre from her eyes; and, though she 
had not faltered at her task, she had drooped daily 
and grown older than her years. The master might 
live with a lavish disregard of the morrow, not the 
master's wife. For him were the open house, the 
shining table, the well-stocked wine cellar and the 
morning rides over the dewy fields; for her the cares 
of her home and children, and of the souls and 
bodies of the black people that had been given into 
her hands. In her gentle heart it seemed to her that 
she had a charge to keep before her God; and she 
went her way humbly, her thoughts filled with things 
so vital as the uses of her medicine chest and the 
unexpounded mysteries of salvation.</p>
                  <pb n="49"/>
                  <p>Now, as she reached the upper landing, she met 
Betty running to look for her.</p>
                  <p>“O, mamma, may I go to fish with Champe and 
the new boy and Big Abel? And Virginia wants to 
go, too, she says.”</p>
                  <p>“Wait a moment, child,” said Mrs. Ambler.      
“You have torn the trimming on your frock. Stand 
still and I'll mend it for you,” and she got out her 
needle and sewed up the rent, while Betty hopped 
impatiently from foot to foot.</p>
                  <p>“I think the new boy's a heap nicer than Champe, 
mamma,” she remarked as she waited.</p>
                  <p>“Do you, dear?”</p>
                  <p>“An' he says I'm nicer than Champe, too. He 
fought Champe 'cause he said I didn't have as much 
sense as he had—an' I have, haven't I, mamma?”</p>
                  <p>“Women do not need as much sense as men, my 
dear,” replied Mrs. Ambler, taking a dainty stitch.</p>
                  <p>“Well, anyway, Dan fought Champe about it,” 
said Betty, with pride. “He'll fight about 'most 
anything, he says, if he jest gets roused—an' that 
cert'n'y did rouse him. His nose bled a long time, 
too, and Champe whipped him, you know. But, 
when it was over, I asked him if I had as much sense 
as he had, and he said, ‘Psha! you're just a girl.’
Wasn't that funny, mamma?”</p>
                  <p>“There, there, Betty,” was Mrs. Ambler's 
rejoinder. “I'm afraid he's a wicked boy, and you 
mustn't get such foolish thoughts into your head. If 
the Lord had wanted you to be clever, He would 
have made you a man. Now, run away, and don't 
get your feet wet; and if you see Aunt Lydia in
<pb n="50"/>											
the garden, you may tell her that the bonnet has 
come for her to look at.”</p>
                  <p>Betty bounded away and gave the message to Aunt 
Lydia over the whitewashed fence of the garden.  
“They've sent a bonnet from New York for you to 
look at, Aunt Lydia,” she cried. “It came all 
wrapped up in tissue paper, with mamma's gray 
silk, and it's got flowers on it—a lot of them!” 
with which parting shot, she turned her back upon 
the startled old lady and dashed off to join the boys 
and Big Abel, who, with their fishing-poles, had 
gathered in the cattle pasture.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lydia, who was lovingly bending over a bed 
of thyme, raised her eyes and looked after the child, 
all in a gentle wonder. Then she went slowly up and 
down the box-bordered walks, the full skirt of her     
“old lady's gown” trailing stiffly over the white 
gravel, her delicate face rising against the 
blossomless shrubs of snowball and bridal-wreath, 
like a faintly tinted flower that had been blighted 
before it—fully bloomed. Around her the garden was 
fragrant as a rose-jar with the lid left off, and the 
very paths beneath were red and white with fallen 
petals. Hardy cabbage roses, single pink and white 
dailies, yellow-centred damask, and the last 
splendours of the giant of battle, all dipped their
 colours to her as she passed, while the little rustic 
summer-house where the walks branched off was 
but a flowering bank of maiden's blush and 
microphylla.</p>
                  <p>Amid them all, Miss Lydia wandered in her full 
black gown, putting aside her filmy ruffles as she 
tied back a hanging spray or pruned a broken stalk,
<pb n="51"/>											
sometimes even lowering her thread lace cap as 
she weeded the tangle of sweet Williams and 
touch-me-not. Since her gentle girlhood she had 
tended bountiful gardens, and dreamed her virgin 
dreams in the purity of their box-trimmed walks. 
In a kind of worldly piety she had bound her 
prayer book in satin and offered to her Maker the 
incense of flowers. She regarded heaven with 
something of the respectful fervour with which she 
regarded the world—that great world she had never 
seen; for “the proper place for a spinster is her 
father's house,” she would say with her conventional 
primness, and send, despite herself, a mild 
imagination in pursuit of the follies from which 
she so earnestly prayed to be delivered—she, to 
whom New York was as the terror of a modern 
Babylon, and a Jezebel but a woman with paint 
upon her cheeks. “They tell me that other women 
have painted since,” she had once said, with a 
wistful curiosity. “Your grandmamma, my dear 
Julia, had even seen one with an artificial colour. 
She would not have mentioned it to me, of course,
—an unmarried lady,—but I was in the next room 
when she spoke of it to old Mrs. Fitzhugh. She 
was a woman of the world, was your grandmamma, 
my dear, and the most finished dancer of her day.” 
The last was said with a timid pride, though to 
Miss Lydia herself the dance was the devil's own 
device, and the teaching of the catechism to 
small black slaves the chief end of existence. But 
the blood of the “most finished dancer of her day” 
still circulated beneath the old lady's gown and 
the religious life, and in her attenuated 
romances she forever held the sinner
<pb n="52"/>											
above the saint, unless, indeed, the sinner chanced to 
be of her own sex, when, probably, the book would 
never have reached her hands. For the purely 
masculine improprieties, her charity was as 
boundless as her innocence. She had even dipped 
into Shakespeare and brought away the memory of 
Mercutio; she had read Scott, and enshrined in her 
pious heart the bold Rob Roy. “Men are very 
wicked, I fear,” she would gently offer, “but they 
are very a—a—engaging, too.”</p>
                  <p>To-day, when Betty came with the message, she 
lingered a moment to convince herself that the 
bonnet was not in her thoughts, and then swept her 
trailing bombazine into the house. “I have come to 
tell you that you may as well send the bonnet back, 
Julia,” she began at once. “Flowers are much too 
fine for me, my dear. I need only a plain black 
poke.”</p>
                  <p>“Come up and try it on,” was Mrs. Ambler's 
cheerful response. “You have no idea how lovely it 
will look on you.”</p>
                  <p>Miss Lydia went up and took the bonnet out of its 
wrapping of tissue paper. “No, you must send it 
back, my love,” she said in a resigned voice. “It 
does not become me to dress as a married woman. It 
may as well go back, Julia.”</p>
                  <p>“But do look in the glass, Aunt Lydia—there, let 
me put it straight for you. Why, it suits you 
perfectly. It makes you look at least ten years 
younger.”</p>
                  <p>“A plain black poke, my dear,” insisted Aunt 
Lydia, as she carefully swathed the flowers in the 
tissue paper. “And, besides, I have my old one,
<pb n="53"/>											
which is quite good enough for me, my love. It was 
very sweet of you to think of it, but it may as well 
go back.” She pensively gazed at the mirror for a 
moment, and then went to her chamber and took out 
her Bible to read Saint Paul on Woman.</p>
                  <p>When she came down a few hours later, her face 
wore an angelic meekness. “I have been thinking of 
that poor Mrs. Brown who was here last week,” she 
said softly, “and I remember her telling me that she 
had no bonnet to wear to church. What a loss it 
must he to her not to attend divine service.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler quickly looked up from her 
needlework. “Why, Aunt Lydia, it would be really a 
charity to give her your old one!” she exclaimed. “It 
does seem a shame that she should be kept away 
from church because of a bonnet. And, then, you 
might as well keep the new one, you know, since it 
is in the house; I hate the trouble of sending it back.”</p>
                  <p>“It would be a charity,” murmured Miss Lydia, 
and the bonnet was brought down and tried On 
again. They were still looking at it when Betty 
rushed in and threw herself upon her mother. “O, 
mamma, I can't help it!” she cried in tears, “an' I 
wish I hadn't done it! Oh, I wish I hadn't; but I set 
fire to the Major's woodpile, and he's whippin' Dan!”</p>
                  <p>“Betty!” exclaimed Mrs. Ambler. She took the 
child by her shoulders and drew her toward her.        
“Betty, did you set fire to the Major's woodpile?” she 
questioned sternly.</p>
                  <pb n="54"/>
                  <p>Betty was sobbing aloud, but she stopped long 
enough to gasp out an answer.</p>
                  <p>“We were playin' Injuns, mamma, an' we couldn't 
make believe 'twas real,” she said, “an' it isn't any 
fun unless you can make believe, so I lit the 
woodpile and pretended it was a fort, an' Big Abel, 
he was an Injun with the axe for a tomahawk; but 
the woodpile blazed right up, an' the Major came 
runnin' out. He asked Dan who did it, an' Dan 
wouldn't say 'twas me,—an' I wouldn't say, either, -
so he took Dan in to whip him. Oh, I wish I'd told! I 
wish I'd told!”</p>
                  <p>“Hush, Betty,” said Mrs. Ambler, and she called 
to the Governor in the hall, “Mr. Ambler, Betty has 
set fire to the Major's woodpile!” Her voice was 
hopeless, and she looked up blankly at her husband 
as he entered.</p>
                  <p>“Set fire to the woodpile!” whistled the 
Governor. “Why, bless my soul, we aren't safe in 
our beds!”</p>
                  <p>“He whipped Dan,” wailed Betty.</p>
                  <p>“We aren't safe in our beds,” repeated the 
Governor, indignantly. “Julia, this is really too 
much.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you will have to ride right over there,” 
said his wife, decisively. “Petunia, run down and tell 
Hosea to saddle his master's horse. Betty, I hope this 
will be a lesson to you. You shan't have any 
preserves for supper for a week.”</p>
                  <p>“I don't want any preserves,” sobbed Betty, her 
apron to her eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Then you mustn't go fishing for two weeks.
Mr. Ambler you'd better be starting at  once, and
<pb n="55"/>											
don't forget to tell the Major that Betty is in great 
distress—you are, aren't you, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, ma'am,” wept Betty.</p>
                  <p>The Governor went out into the hall and took 
down his hat and riding-whip.</p>
                  <p>“The sins of the children are visited upon the 
fathers,” he remarked gloomily as he mounted his 
horse and rode away from his supper.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>THE SCHOOL FOR GENTLEMEN</head>
                  <p>THE Governor rode up too late to avert the 
punishment. Dan had taken his whipping and was 
sitting on a footstool in the library, facing the Major 
and a couple of the Major's cronies. His face wore 
an expression in which there was more resentment 
than resignation; for, though he took blows 
doggedly, he bore the memory of them long after the 
smart had ceased—long, indeed, after light-handed 
justice, in the Major's person, had forgotten alike the 
sin and the expiation. For the Major's hand was not 
steady at the rod, and he had often regretted a 
weakness of heart which interfered with a physical 
interpretation of the wisdom of Solomon. “If you get 
your deserts, you'd get fifty  lashes,” was his 
habitual reproof to his servants, though, as a matter 
of fact, he had never been known to order one. His 
anger was sometimes of the kind that appalls, but it 
usually vented itself in a heightened redness of face 
or a single thundering oath; and a woman's sob 
would melt his stoniest mood. It was only because 
his daughter had kept out of his sight that he had 
never forgiven her, people said; but there was, 
perhaps, something characteristic in the proof that he 
was most relentless where he had most loved.</p>
                  <pb n="57"/>
                  <p>As for Dan's chastisement, he had struck him 
twice across the shoulders, and when the boy had 
turned to him with the bitter smile which was Jane 
Lightfoot's own, the Major had choked in his wrath, 
and, a moment later, flung the whip aside. “I'll be 
damned,—I beg your pardon, sir,—I'll be ashamed of 
myself if I give you another lick,” he said. “You are 
a gentleman, and I shall trust you.”</p>
                  <p>He held out his hand, but he had not counted on 
the Montjoy blood. The boy looked at him and 
stubbornly shook his head. “I can't shake hands yet 
because I am hating you just now,” he answered. 
“ Will you wait awhile, sir?” and the Major choked 
again, half in awe, half in amusement.</p>
                  <p>“You don't bear malice, I reckon?” he ventured 
cautiously.</p>
                  <p>“I am not sure,” replied the boy, “I rather think I 
do.”</p>
                  <p>Then he put on his coat, and they went out to meet 
Mr. Blake and Dr. Crump, two hale and jolly 
gentlemen who rode over every Thursday to spend 
the night.</p>
                  <p>As the visitors came panting up the steps, the 
Major stood in the doorway with outstretched 
hands.</p>
                  <p>“You are late, gentlemen, you are late,” was his 
weekly greeting, to which they as regularly 
responded, “We could never come too early for our 
pleasure, my dear Major: but there are professional 
duties, you know, professional duties.”</p>
                  <p>After this interchange of courtesies, they would 
enter the house and settle themselves, winter or summer, 
in their favourite chairs upon the hearth-rug,
<pb n="58"/>
when it was the custom of Mrs. Lightfoot to send in 
a fluttering maid to ask if Mrs. Blake had done her 
the honour to accompany her husband. As Mrs. 
Blake was never known to leave her children and her 
pet poultry, this was merely a conventionalism by 
which the elder lady meant to imply a standing 
welcome for the younger.</p>
                  <p>On this evening, Mr. Blake—the rector of the 
largest church in Leicesterburg—straightened his fat 
legs and folded his hands as he did at the ending of 
his sermons, and the others sat before him with the 
strained and reverential faces which they put on like 
a veil in church and took off when the service was 
over. That it was not a prayer, but a pleasantry of 
which he was about to deliver himself, they quite 
understood; but he had a habit of speaking on week 
days in his Sunday tones, which gave, as it were, an 
official weight to his remarks. He was a fleshy 
wide-girthed gentleman, with a bald head, and a face 
as radiant as the full moon.</p>
                  <p>“I was just asking the doctor when I was to have the 
honour of making the little widow Mrs. Crump?” he 
threw out at last, with a laugh that shook him from 
head to foot. “It is not good for man to live alone, 
eh, Major?”</p>
                  <p>“That sentence is sufficient to prove the divine 
inspiration of the Scriptures,” returned the Major, 
warmly, while the doctor blushed and stammered, as 
he always did, at the rector's mild matrimonial jokes. 
It was twenty years since Mr. Blake began teasing 
Dr. Crump about his bachelorship, and to them both 
the subject was as fresh as in its beginning.</p>
                  <pb n="59"/>
                  <p>“I—I declare I haven't seen the lady for a week,” 
protested the doctor, “and then she sent for me.”</p>
                  <p>“Sent for you?” roared Mr. Blake. “Ah, doctor, 
doctor!”</p>
                  <p>“She sent for me because she had heart trouble,” 
returned the doctor, indignantly. The lady's name 
was never mentioned between them.</p>
                  <p>The rector laughed until the tears started.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, you're a success with the ladies,” he 
exclaimed, as he drew out a neatly ironed 
handkerchief and shook it free from its folds, “and 
no wonder—no wonder! We'll be having an 
epidemic of heart trouble next.” Then, as he saw the 
doctor wince beneath his jest, his kindly heart 
reproached him, and he gravely turned to politics 
and the dignity of nations.</p>
                  <p>The two friends were faithful Democrats, though 
the rector always began his very forcible remarks 
with: “A minister knows nothing of politics, and I 
am but a minister of the Gospel. If you care, 
however, for the opinion of an outsider—”</p>
                  <p>As for the Major, he had other leanings which 
were a source of unending interest to them all. “I 
am a Whig, not from principle, but from prejudice, 
sir,” he declared. “The Whig is the gentleman's 
party.  I never saw a Whig that didn't wear 
broadcloth.”</p>
                  <p>“And some Democrats,” politely protested the 
doctor, with a glance at his coat.</p>
                  <p>The Major bowed.</p>
                  <p>“And many Democrats, sir; but the Whig party, 
if I may say so, is the broadcloth party—the cloth
<pb n="60"/>										
stamps it; and besides this, sir, I think its ‘parts are 
solid and will wear well.’”</p>
                  <p>Now when the Major began to quote Mr. Addison, 
even the rector was silent, save for an occasional 
prompting, as, “I was reading the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> until 
eleven last night, sir,” or “I have been trying to 
recall the lines in <hi rend="italics">The Campaign</hi> before  ”Twas then 
great Marlborough's mighty soul was proved.”</p>
                  <p>This was the best of the day to Dan, and, as he 
turned on his footstool, he did not even glare at 
Champe, who, from the window seat, was regarding 
him with the triumphant eye with which the young 
behold the downfall of a brother. For a moment he 
had forgotten the whipping, but Champe had not; he 
was thinking of it in the window seat.</p>
                  <p>But the Major was standing on the hearth-rug, and 
the boy's gaze went to him. Tossing back his long 
white hair, and fixing his eagle glance on his friends, 
the old gentleman, with a free sweep of his arm, 
thundered his favourite lines: -</p>

                  <p>He had got so far when the door opened and the 
Governor entered—a little hurriedly, for he was 
thinking of his supper.</p>
                  <p>“I am the bearer of an apology, my dear Major,” 
he said, when he had heartily shaken hands all round. 
“It seems that Betty—I assure you she is in great 
distress—set fire to your woodpile this afternoon,
<pb n="61"/>										
and that your grandson was punished for her 
mischief. My dear boy,” he laid his hand on Dan's 
shoulder and looked into his face with the winning 
smile which had made him the most popular man in 
his State, “my dear boy, you are young to be such a 
gentleman.”</p>
                  <p>A hot flush overspread Dan's face; he forgot the 
smart and the wounded pride—he forgot even 
Champe staring from the window seat. The 
Governor's voice was like salve to his hurt; the 
upright little man with the warm brown eyes seemed 
to lift him at once to the plane of his own chivalry.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I couldn't tell on a girl, sir,” he answered, 
and then his smothered injury burst forth; “but she 
ought to be ashamed of herself,” he added bluntly.</p>
                  <p>“She is,” said the Governor with a smile; then he 
turned to the others. “Major, the boy is a 
Lightfoot!” he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, so I said, so I said!” cried the Major, 
clapping his hand on Dan's head in a racial 
benediction. “‘I'd  know you were a Lightfoot if I 
met you in the road’ was what I said the first 
evening.”</p>
                  <p>“And a Virginian,” added Mr. Blake, folding his 
hands on his stomach and smiling upon the group.  
“My daughter in New York wrote to me last week for 
advice about the education of her son. ‘Shall I send 
him to the school of learning at Cambridge, papa?’
she asked; and I answered, ‘Send him there, if you 
will, but, when he has finished with his books, by all 
means let him come to Virginia—the school for 
gentlemen.’”</p>
                  <pb n="62"/>
                  <p>“The school for gentlemen!” cried the doctor, 
delightedly. “It is a prouder title than the ‘Mother of 
Presidents.’”</p>
                  <p>“And as honourably earned,” added the rector. 
“If you want polish, come to Virginia; if you want 
chivalry, come to Virginia. When I see these two 
things combined, I say to myself, ‘The blood of the 
Mother of Presidents is here.’”</p>
                  <p>“You are right, sir, you are right!” cried the Major, 
shaking back his hair, as he did when he was about 
to begin the lines from <hi rend="italics">The Campaign</hi>. “Nothing 
gives so fine a finish to a man as a few years spent 
with the influences that moulded Washington. Why, 
some foreigners are perfected by them, sir. When I 
met General Lafayette in Richmond upon his second 
visit, I remember being agreeably impressed with his 
dignity and ease, which, I have no doubt, sir, he 
acquired by his association, in early years, with the 
Virginia gentlemen.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor looked at them with a twinkle in his 
eye. He was aware of the humorous traits of his 
friends, but, in the peculiar sweetness of his temper, 
he loved them not the less because he laughed at 
them—perhaps the more. In the rector's fat body and 
the Major's lean one, he knew that there beat hearts 
as chivalrous as their words. He had seen the Major 
doff his hat to a beggar in the road, and the rector 
ride forty miles in a snowstorm to read a prayer at 
the burial of a slave. So he said with a pleasant 
laugh, “We are surely the best judges, my dear 
sirs,” and then, as Mrs. Lightfoot rustled in, they 
rose and fell back until she had taken her seat, and 
found her knitting.</p>
                  <pb n="63"/>
                  <p>“I am so sorry not to see Mrs. Blake,” she said to 
the rector. “I have a new recipe for yellow pickle 
which I must write out and send to her.” And, as 
the Governor rose to go, she stood up and begged 
him to stay to supper. “Mr. Lightfoot, can't you 
persuade him to sit down with us?” she asked.</p>
                  <p>“Where you have failed, Molly, it is useless for 
me to try,” gallantly responded the Major, picking 
up her ball of yarn.</p>
                  <p>“But I must bear your pardon to my little girl, I 
really must,” insisted the Governor. “By the way, 
Major,” he added, turning at the door, “what do you 
think of the scheme to let the Government buy the 
slaves and ship them back to Africa? I was talking 
to a Congressman about it last week.”</p>
                  <p>“Sell the servants to the Government!” cried the 
Major, hotly. “Nonsense! nonsense! Why, you are 
striking at the very foundation of our society! 
Without slavery, where is our aristocracy, sir?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” said the Governor 
lightly. “Well, we shall keep them a while longer, I 
expect. Good night, madam, good night, gentlemen,” 
and he went out to where his horse was 
standing.</p>
                  <p>The Major looked after him with a sigh. “When I 
hear a man talking about the abolition of slavery,” 
he remarked gloomily, “I always expect him to 
want to do away with marriage next—”he checked 
himself and coloured, as if an improper speech had 
slipped out in the presence of Mrs. Lightfoot. The 
old lady rose primly and, taking the rector's arm, led 
the way to supper.</p>
                  <pb n="64"/>
                  <p>Dan was not noticed at the table,—it was a part 
of his grandmother's social training to ignore 
children before visitors,—but when he went upstairs 
that night, the Major came to the boy's room and 
took him in his arms.</p>
                  <p>“I am proud of you, my child,” he said. “You are 
my grandson, every inch of you, and you shall have 
the finest riding horse in the stables on your 
birthday.”</p>
                  <p>“I'd rather have Big Abel, if you please, sir,” 
returned Dan. “I think Big Abel would like to 
belong to me, grandpa.”</p>
                  <p>“Bless my soul!” cried the Major. “Why, you 
shall have Big Abel and his whole family, if you 
like. I'll give you every darky on the place, if you 
want them—and the horses to boot,” for the old 
gentleman was as unwise in his generosity as in his 
wrath.</p>
                  <p>“Big Abel will do, thank you,” responded the 
boy; “and I'd like to shake hands now, grandpa,” he 
added gravely; but before the Major left that night 
he had won not only the child's hand, but his heart. 
It was the beginning of the great love between them.</p>
                  <p>For from that day Dan was as the light of his 
grandfather's eyes. As the boy strode manfully 
across the farm, his head thrown back, his hands 
clasped behind him, the old man followed, in wondering 
pride, on his footsteps. To see him stand amid 
the swinging cradles in the wheat field, ordering the 
slaves and arguing with the overseer, was sufficient 
delight unto the Major's day. “Nonsense, Molly,” he 
would reply half angrily to his wife's 
<pb n="65"/>
remonstrances. “The child can't be spoiled. I tell 
you he's too fine a boy. I couldn't spoil him if I 
tried,” and once out of his grandmother's sight, 
Dan's arrogance was laughed at, and his 
recklessness was worshipped. “Ah, you will make a 
man, you will make a man!” the Major had 
exclaimed when he found him swearing at the 
overseer, “but you mustn't curse, you really mustn't, 
you know. Why, your grandmother won't let me do 
it.”</p>
                  <p>“But I told him to leave that haystack for me to 
slide on,” complained the boy, “and he said he 
wouldn't, and began to pull it down. I wish you'd 
send him away, grandpa.”</p>
                  <p>“Send Harris away!” whistled the Major.           
“Why, where could I get another, Dan? He has been 
with me for twenty years.”</p>
                  <p>“Hi, young Marster, who gwine min' de han's?” 
cried Big Abel, from behind.</p>
                  <p>“Do you like him, Big Abel?” asked the child, for 
the opinion of Big Abel was the only one for which 
he ever showed respect. “It's because he's not free, 
grandpa,” he had once explained at the Major's 
jealous questioning. “I wouldn't hurt his feelings 
because he's not free, you know, and he couldn't 
answer back,” and the Major had said nothing more.</p>
                  <p>Now “Do you like him, Big Abel?” he inquired; 
and to the negro's “He's done use me moughty well, 
suh,” he said gravely, “Then he shall stay, 
grandpa—and I'm sorry I cursed you, Harris,” he 
added before he left the field. He would always own 
that he was as wrong, if he could once be made to 
see it, which rarely happened.</p>
                  <pb n="66"/>
                  <p>“The boy's kind heart will save him, or he is 
lost,” said the Governor, sadly, as Dan tore by on his 
little pony, his black hair blown from his face, his 
gray eyes shining.</p>
                  <p>“He has a kind heart, I know,” returned Mrs. 
Ambler, gently; “the servants and the animals adore 
him—but—but do you think it well for Betty to be 
thrown so much with him? He is very wild, and 
they deny him nothing. I wish she went with Champe 
instead—but what do you think?”</p>
                  <p>“I don't know, I don't know,” answered the 
Governor, uneasily. “He told the doctor to mind his 
own business, yesterday—and that is not unlike 
Betty, herself, I am sorry to say—but this morning I 
saw him give his month's pocket money to that poor 
free negro, Levi. I can't say, I really do not know,” 
his eyes followed Betty as she flew out to climb 
behind Dan on the pony's back. “I wish it were 
Champe, myself,” he added doubtfully.</p>
                  <p>For Betty—independent Betty—had become Dan's 
slave. Ever since the afternoon of the burning 
woodpile, she had bent her stubborn little knees to 
him in hero-worship. She followed closer than a 
shadow on his footsteps; no tortures could wring his 
secrets from her lips. Once, when he hid himself in 
the mountains for a day and night and played Indian, 
she kept silence, though she knew his hiding-place, 
and a search party was out with lanterns until dawn.</p>
                  <p>“I didn't tell,” she said triumphantly, when he 
came down again.</p>
                  <p>“No, you didn't tell,” he frankly acknowledged.</p>
                  <pb n="67"/>
                  <p>“So I can keep a secret,” she declared at last.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, yes, you can keep a secret—for a girl,” he 
returned, and added, “I tell you what, I like you 
better than anybody about here, except grandpa and 
Big Abel.”</p>
                  <p>She shone upon him, her eyes narrowing; then her 
face darkened. “Not better than Big Abel?” she 
questioned plaintively.</p>
                  <p>“Why, I have to like Big Abel best,” he replied,    
“because he belongs to me, you know—you ought to 
love the thing that belongs to you.”</p>
                  <p>“But I might belong to you,” suggested Betty. 
She smiled again, and, smiling or grave, she always 
looked as if she were standing in a patch of 
sunshine, her hair made such a brightness about 
her.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you couldn't, you're white,” said Dan;         
“and, besides, I reckon Big Abel and the pony are 
as much as I can manage. It's a dreadful weight, 
having people belong to you.”</p>
                  <p>Then he loaded his gun, and Betty ran away with 
her fingers in her ears, because she couldn't bear to 
have things killed.</p>
                  <p>A month later Dan and Champe settled down to 
study. The new tutor came—a serious young man 
from the North, who wore spectacles, and read the 
Bible to the slaves on the half-holidays. He was 
kindly and conscientious, and, though the boys 
found him unduly weighed down by responsibility 
for the souls of his fellows, they soon loved him in a 
light-hearted fashion. In a society where even the 
rector harvested alike the true grain and the tares, 
and left the Almighty to do His own winnowing, 
Mr. Bennett's free-handed fight with the
<pb n="68"/>
flesh and the devil was looked upon with smiling 
tolerance, as if he were charging a windmill with a 
wooden sword.</p>
                  <p>On Saturdays he would ride over to Uplands, and 
discuss his schemes for the uplifting of the negroes 
with the Governor and Mrs. Ambler; and once he 
even went so far as to knock at Rainy-day Jones's 
door and hand him a pamphlet entitled “The Duties 
of the Slaveholder.” Old Rainy-day, who was the 
biggest bully in the county, set the dogs on him, and 
lit his pipe with the pamphlet; but the Major, when 
he heard the story, laughed, and called the young 
man “a second David.”</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bennett looked at him seriously through his 
glasses, and then his eyes wandered to the small 
slave, Mitty, whose chief end in life was the finding 
of Mrs. Lightfoot's spectacles. He was an earnest 
young man, but he could not keep his eyes away 
from Mitty when she was in the room; and at the old 
lady's, “Mitty, my girl, find me my glasses,” he felt 
like jumping from his seat and calling upon her to 
halt. It seemed a survival of the dark ages that one 
immortal soul should spend her life hunting for the 
spectacles of another. To Mr. Bennett, a soul was a 
soul in any colour; to the Major the sons of Ham 
were under a curse which the Lord would lighten in 
His own good time.</p>
                  <p>But before many months, the young man had won 
the affection of the boys and the respect of their 
grandfather, whose candid lack of logic was 
overpowered by the reasons which Mr. Bennett 
carried at every finger tip. He not only believed 
things, he knew why he believed them; and to the
<pb n="69"/>
Major, with whom feelings were convictions, this 
was more remarkable than the courage with which 
he had handed his tract to old Rainy-day Jones.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. Bennett, he found the Major a riddle 
that he could not read; but the Governor's first smile 
had melted his reserve, and he declared Mrs. Ambler 
to be “a Madonna by Perugino.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler had never heard of Perugino, and the 
word “Madonna” suggested to her vague Romanist 
snares, but her heart went out to the stranger when 
she found that he was in mourning for his mother. 
She was not a clever woman in a worldly sense, yet 
her sympathy, from the hourly appeals to it, had 
grown as fine as intellect. She was hopelessly 
ignorant of ancient history and the Italian 
Renaissance; but she had a genius for the affections, 
and where a greater mind would have blundered over 
a wound, her soft hand went by intuition to the spot. 
It was very pleasant to sit in a rosewood chair in her 
parlour, to hear her gray silk rustle as she crossed 
her feet, and to watch her long white fingers 
interlace.</p>
                  <p>So she talked to the young man of his mother, and 
he showed her the daguerrotype of the girl he loved; 
and at last she confided to him her anxieties for 
Betty's manners and the Governor's health, and her 
timid wonder that the Bible “countenanced” slavery. 
She was rare and elegant like a piece of fine point 
lace; her hands had known no harder work than the 
delicate hemstitching, and her mind had never 
wandered over the nearer hills.</p>
                  <p>As time went on, Betty was given over to the
<pb n="70"/>
care of her governess, and she was allowed to run 
wild no more in the meadows. Virginia, a pretty 
prim little girl, already carried her prayer book in 
her hands when she drove to church, and wore Swiss 
muslin frocks in the evenings; but Betty when she 
was made to hem tablecloths on sunny mornings, 
would weep until her needle rusted.</p>
                  <p>On cloudy days she would sometimes have her 
ambitions to be ladylike, and once, when she had 
gone to a party in town and seen Virginia dancing 
while she sat against the wall, she had come home to 
throw herself upon the floor.</p>
                  <p>“It's not that I care for boys, mamma,” she 
wailed, “for I despise them; but they oughtn't to 
have let me sit against the wall. And none of them 
asked me to dance—not even Dan.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, you are nothing but a child, Betty,” said 
Mrs. Ambler, in dismay. “What on earth does it 
matter to you whether the boys notice you or not?”</p>
                  <p>“It doesn't,” sobbed Betty; “but you wouldn't like 
to sit against the wall, mamma.”</p>
                  <p>“You can make them suffer for it six years hence, 
daughter,” suggested the Governor, revengefully.</p>
                  <p>“But suppose they don't have anything to do with 
me then,” cried Betty, and wept afresh.</p>
                  <p>In the end, it was Uncle Bill who brought her to 
her feet, and, in doing so, he proved himself to be the 
philosopher that he was.</p>
                  <p>“I tell you what, Betty,” he exclaimed, “if you get 
up and stop crying, I'll give you fifty cents. I reckon 
fifty cents will make up for any boy, eh?”</p>
                  <p>Betty lay still and looked up from the floor.</p>
                  <pb n="71"/>
                  <p>“I—I reckon a dol-lar m-i-g-h-t,” she gasped,
and caught a sob before it burst out.</p>
                  <p>“Well, you get up and I'll give you a dollar. There ain't 
many boys worth a dollar, I can tell you.”</p>
                  <p>Betty got up and held out one hand as she wiped her 
eyes with the other.</p>
                  <p>“I shall never speak to a boy again,” she declared, as 
she took the money.</p>
                  <p>That was when she was thirteen, and a year later 
Dan went away to college.</p>

                     <p>“MY dear grandpa,” wrote Dan during his first 
weeks at college,  “I think I am going to like it pretty 
well here after I get used to the professors. The 
professors are a great nuisance. They seem to forget 
that a fellow of seventeen isn't a baby any longer.</p>
                     <p>“The Arcades are very nice, and the maples on the 
lawn remind me of those at Uplands, only they aren't 
nearly so fine. My room is rather small, but Big 
Abel keeps everything put away, so I manage to get 
along. Champe sleeps next to me, and we are always 
shouting through the wall for Big Abel. I tell you, he 
has to step lively now.</p>
                     <p>“The night after we came, we went to supper at 
Professor Ball's. There was a Miss Ball there who 
had a pair of big eyes, but girls are so silly. Champe 
talked to her all the evening and walked out to the 
graveyard with her the next afternoon. I don't see 
why he wants to spend so much of his time with 
young ladies. It's because they think him 
good-looking, I reckon. </p>
                     <p>“We are the only men who have horses here, so I am 
glad you made me bring Prince Rupert, after all. 
When I ride him into town, everybody turns to look 
at him, and Batt Horsford, the stableman, says
											
<pb n="73"/>
his trot is as clean as a razor. At first I wished I'd 
brought my hunter instead, they made such a fuss 
over Champe's, and I tell you he's a regular 
timber-topper.</p>
                     <p>“A week ago I rode to the grave of Mr. Jefferson, 
as I promised you, but I couldn't carry the wreath 
for grandma because it would have looked silly—
Champe said so. However, I made Big Abel get 
down and pull a few flowers on the way.</p>
                     <p>“You know, I had always thought that only 
gentlemen came to the University, but whom do you 
think I met the first evening?—why, the son of old 
Rainy-day Jones. What do you think of that? He 
actually had the impudence to pass himself off as 
one of the real Joneses, and he was going with all 
the men. Of course, I refused to shake hands with 
him—so did Champe—and, when he wanted to fight 
me, I said I fought only gentlemen. I wish you could 
have seen his face. He looked as old Rainy-day did 
when he hit the free negro Levi, and I knocked him 
down.</p>
                     <p>“By the way, I wish you would please send me 
my half-year's pocket money in a lump, if you can 
conveniently do so. There is a man here who is 
working his way through Law, and his mother has 
just lost all her money, so, unless some one helps 
him, he'll have to go out and work before he takes 
his degree. I've promised to lend him my half-year's 
allowance—I said ‘lend’ because it might hurt 
his feelings; but, of course, I don't want him to 
pay it back. He's a great fellow, but I can't tell 
you his name—I shouldn't like it in his place, you 
know.</p>
                     <pb n="74"/>
                     <p>“The worst thing about college life is having to 
go to classes. If it wasn't for that I should be all 
right, and, anyway, I am solid on my Greek and Latin—
but I can't get on with the higher mathematics. Mr. 
Bennett couldn't drive them into my head as he did 
into Champe's.</p>
                     <p>“I hope grandma has entirely recovered from her 
lumbago. Tell her Mrs. Ball says she was cured by 
using red pepper plasters.</p>
                     <p>“Do you know, by the way, that I left my 
half-dozen best waistcoats—the embroidered 
ones—in the bottom drawer of my bureau, at least 
Big Abel swears that's where he put them. I should 
be very much obliged if grandma would have them 
fixed up and sent to me—I can't do without them. A 
great many gentlemen here are wearing coloured 
cravats, and Charlie Morson's brother, who came up 
from Richmond for a week, has a pair of side 
whiskers. He says they are fashionable down there, 
but I don't like them.</p>

                     <p>The Major read the letter aloud to his wife while she 
sat knitting by the fireside, with Mitty holding the ball 
of yarn on a footstool at her feet.</p>
                     <p>“What do you think of that, Molly?” he asked when 
he had finished, his voice quivering with excitement.</p>
                     <p>“Red pepper plasters!” returned the old lady, 
contemptuously. “As if I hadn't been making them for 
Cupid for the last twenty years. Red pepper plasters, 
indeed! Why, they're no better than mustard ones. I 
reckon I've made enough of them to know.”</p>
                     <p>“I don't mean that, Molly,” explained the Major, a 
little crestfallen. “I was speaking of the letter. That's a 
fine letter, now, isn't it?”</p>
                     <p>“It might be worse,” admitted Mrs. Lightfoot, coolly; 
“but for my part, I don't care to have my grandson upon 
terms of equality with any of that rascal Jones's blood. 
Why, the man whips his servants.”</p>
                     <p>“But he isn't upon any terms, my dear. He refused to 
shake hands with him, didn't you hear that? Perhaps I'd 
better read the letter again.”</p>
                     <p>“That is all very well, Mr. Lightfoot,” said his wife, 
clicking her needles, “but it can't prevent his being in 
classes with him, all the same. And I am sure, if I had 
known the University was so little select, I should have 
insisted upon sending him to Oxford, where his 
great-grandfather went before him.”</p>
                     <p>“Good gracious, Molly! You don't wish the lad was 
across the ocean, do you?”</p>
                     <p>“It matters very little where he is so long as he
<pb n="76"/>
is a gentleman,” returned the old lady, so sharply 
that Mitty began to unwind the worsted rapidly.</p>
                     <p>“Nonsense, Molly,” protested the Major, irritably, 
for he could not stand opposition upon his own 
hearth-rug. “The boy couldn't be hurt by sitting in 
the same class with the devil himself—nor could 
Champe, for that matter. They are too good 
Lightfoots.”</p>
                     <p>“I am not uneasy about Champe,” rejoined his 
wife. “Champe has never been humoured as Dan has 
been, I'm glad to say.”</p>
                     <p>The Major started up as red as a beet.</p>
                     <p>“Do you mean that I humour him, madam?” he 
demanded in a terrible voice.</p>
                     <p>“Do pray, Mr. Lightfoot, you will frighten Mitty 
to death,” said his wife, reprovingly, “and it is really 
very dangerous for you to excite yourself so—you 
remember the doctor cautioned you against it.” And, 
by the time the Major was thoroughly depressed, she 
skilfully brought out her point. “Of course you spoil 
the child to death. You know it as well as I do.”</p>
                     <p>The Major, with the fear of apoplexy in his mind, 
had no answer on his tongue, though a few minutes 
later he showed his displeasure by ordering his horse 
and riding to Uplands to talk things over with the 
Governor.</p>
                     <p>“I am afraid Molly is breaking,” he thought 
gloomily, as he rode along. “She isn't what she was 
when I married her fifty years ago.”</p>
                     <p>But at Uplands his ill humour was dispelled. The 
Governor read the letter and declared that Dan was a 
fine lad, “and I'm glad you haven't spoiled him,
<pb n="77"/>
Major,” he said heartily. “Yes, they're both fine 
lads and do you honour.”</p>
                     <p>“So they do! so they do!” exclaimed the Major, 
delightedly. “That's just what I said to Molly, sir. 
And Dan sends his love to the little girls,” he added, 
smiling upon Betty and Virginia, who stood by.</p>
                     <p>“Thank you, sir,” responded Virginia, prettily, 
looking at the old man with her dovelike eyes; but 
Betty tossed her head—she had an imperative little 
toss which she used when she was angry. “I am 
only three years younger than he is,” she said, “and 
I'm not a little girl any longer—Mammy has had to 
let down all my dresses. I am fourteen years old, 
sir.”</p>
                     <p>“And quite a young lady,” replied the Major, with 
a bow. “There are not two handsomer girls in the 
state, Governor, which means, of course, that there 
are not two handsomer girls in the world, sir. Why, 
Virginia's eyes are almost a match for my Aunt 
Emmeline's, and poets have immortalized hers. Do 
you recall the verses by the English officer she 
visited in prison?—</p>
                     <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                        <l part="N">“‘The stars in Rebel skies that shine </l>
                        <l part="N">Are the bright orbs of Emmeline.’”</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>“Yes, I remember,” said the Governor.                 
“Emmeline Lightfoot is as famous as Diana,” then 
his quick eyes caught Betty's drooping head, “and 
what of this little lady?” he asked, patting her 
shoulder. “There's not a brighter smile in Virginia 
than hers, eh, Major?”</p>
                     <pb n="78"/>
                     <p>But the Major was not to be outdone when there 
were compliments to be exchanged.</p>
                     <p>“Her hair is like the sunshine,” he began, and 
checked himself, for at the first mention of her hair 
Betty had fled.</p>
                     <p>It was on this afternoon that she brewed a dye of 
walnut juice and carried it in secret to her room. She 
had loosened her braids and was about to plunge her 
head into the basin when Mrs. Ambler came in upon 
her. “Why, Betty! Betty!” she cried in horror.</p>
                     <p>Betty turned with a start, wrapped in her shining 
hair. “It is the only thing left to do, mamma,” she 
said desperately. “I am going to dye it. It isn't 
ladylike, I know, but red hair isn't ladylike either. I 
have tried conjuring, and it won't conjure, so I'm 
going to dye it.”</p>
                     <p>“Betty!  Betty!” was all Mrs. Ambler could say, 
though she seized the basin and threw it from the 
window as if it held poison. “If you ever let that 
stuff touch your hair, I—I'll shave your head for 
you,” she declared as she left the room; but a 
moment afterward she looked in again to add, “Your 
grandmamma had red hair, and she was the beauty 
of her day—there, now, you ought to be ashamed of 
yourself!”</p>
                     <p>So Betty smiled again, and when Virginia came 
in to dress for supper, she found her parading about 
in Aunt Lydia's best bombazine gown.</p>
                     <p>“This is how I'll look when I'm grown up,” she 
said, the corner of her eye on her sister.</p>
                     <p>“You'll look just lovely,” returned Virginia, 
promptly, for she always said the sweetest thing at 
the sweetest time.</p>
                     <pb n="79"/>
                     <p>“And I'm going to look like this when Dan comes 
home next summer,” resumed Betty, sedately.</p>
                     <p>“Not in Aunt Lydia's dress?”</p>
                     <p>“You goose!  Of course not. I'm going to get Mammy 
to make me a Swiss muslin down to the ground, and I'm 
going to wear six starched petticoats because I haven't 
any hoops. I'm just wild to wear hoops, aren't you, 
Virginia?”</p>
                     <p>“I reckon so,” responded Virginia, doubtfully; “but it 
will be hard to sit down, don't you think?”</p>
                     <p>“Oh, but I know how,” said Betty. “Aunt Lydia 
showed me how to do it gracefully. You give a little 
kick—ever so little and nobody sees it—and then you 
just sink into your seat. I can do it well.”</p>
                     <p>“You were always clever,” exclaimed Virginia, as 
sweetly as before. She was parting her satiny hair over 
her forehead, and the glass gave back a youthful 
likeness of Mrs. Ambler. She was the beauty of the 
family, and she knew it, which made her all the lovelier 
to Betty.</p>
                     <p>“I declare, your freckles are all gone,” she said, as 
her sister's head looked over her shoulder. “I wonder if 
it is the buttermilk that has made you so white?”</p>
                     <p>“It must be that,” admitted Betty, who had used it 
faithfully for the sixty nights “Aunt Lydia says it works 
wonders.” Then, as she looked at herself, her eyes 
narrowed and she laughed aloud. “Why, Dan won't 
know me,” she cried merrily.</p>
                     <p>But whatever hopes she had of Dan withered in the 
summer. When he came home for the holidays, he 
brought with him an unmistakable swagger and
<pb n="80"/>
a supply of coloured neckerchiefs. On his first visit 
to Uplands he called Virginia “my pretty child,” and 
said “Good day, little lady,” to Betty. He carried 
himself like an Indian, as the Governor put it, and he 
was very lithe and muscular, though he did not 
measure up to Champe by half a head. It was the 
Montjoy blood in him, people thought, for the 
Lightfoots were all of great height, and he had, too, a 
shock of his father's coarse black hair, which flared 
stiffly above the brilliant Lightfoot eyes. As he 
galloped along the turnpike on Prince Rupert, the 
travelling countrymen turned to look after him, and 
muttered that “dare-devil Jack Montjoy had risen 
from his grave—if he had a grave.”</p>
                     <p>Once he met Betty at the gate, and catching her up 
before him, dashed with her as far as Aunt Ailsey's 
cabin and back again. “You are as light as a fly,” he 
said with a laugh, “and not much bigger. There, 
take your hair out of my eyes, or I'll ride amuck.”</p>
                     <p>Betty caught her hair in one hand and drew it 
across her breast. “This is like—”she began gayly, 
and checked herself. She was thinking of “that devil 
Jack Montjoy and Jane Lightfoot.”</p>
                     <p>“I must take my chance now,” said Dan, in his 
easy, masterful way. “You will be too old for this 
by next year. Why, you will be in long dresses then, 
and Virginia—have you noticed, by the way, what a 
beauty Virginia is going to be?”</p>
                     <p>“She is just lovely,” heartily agreed Betty. “She's 
prettier than your Great-aunt Emmeline, isn't she?”</p>
                     <p>“By George, she is. And I've been in love with
<pb n="81"/>
Great-aunt Emmeline for ten years because I couldn't 
find her match. I say, don't let anybody go off with 
Virginia while I'm at college, will you?”</p>
                     <p>“All right,” said Betty, and though she smiled at him 
through her hair, her smile was not so bright as it had 
been. It was all very well to hear Virginia praised, she 
told herself, but she should have liked it better had Dan 
been a little less emphatic. “I don't think any one is 
going to run off with her,” she added gravely, and let 
the subject of her sister's beauty pass.</p>
                     <p>But at the end of the week, when Dan went back to 
college, her loyal heart reproached her, and she 
confided to Virginia that “he thought her a great deal 
lovelier than Great-aunt Emmeline.”</p>
                     <p>“Really?” asked Virginia, and determined to be 
very nice to him when he came home for the holidays.</p>
                     <p>“But what does he say about you?” she inquired 
after a moment.</p>
                     <p>“About me?” returned Betty. “Oh, he doesn't say 
anything about me, except that I am kind.”</p>
                     <p>Virginia stooped and kissed her. “You are kind 
dear,” she said in her sweetest voice.</p>
                     <p>And “kind,” after all, was the word for Betty, 
unless Big Abel had found one when he said, “She 
is des all heart.” It was Betty who had tramped 
three miles through the snow last Christmas to carry 
her gifts to the free negro Levi, who was “laid up” 
and could not come to claim his share; and it was 
Betty who had asked as a present for herself the 
lame boy Micah, that belonged to old Rainy-day 
Jones. She had met Micah in the road, and from
<pb n="82"/>
that day the Governor's life was a burden until he 
sent the negro up to her door on Christmas morning. 
There was never a sick slave or a homeless dog that 
she would not fly out to welcome, bareheaded and a 
little breathless, with the kindness brimming over 
from her eyes. “She has her father's head and her 
mother's heart,” said the Major to his wife, when he 
saw the girl going by with the dogs leaping round 
her and a young fox in her arms. “What a wife she 
would make for Dan when she grows up! I wish he'd 
fancy her. They'd be well suited, eh, Molly?”</p>
                     <p>“If he fancies the thing that is suited to him, 
he is less of a man than I take him to be,” retorted Mrs. 
Lightfoot, with a cynicism which confounded the 
Major. “He will lose his head over her doll baby of 
a sister, I suppose—not that she isn't a good girl,” 
she added briskly. “Julia Ambler couldn't have had a 
bad child if she had tried, though I confess I am 
surprised that she could have helped having a silly 
one; but Betty, why, there hasn't been a girl since I 
grew up with so much sense in her head as Betty 
Ambler has in her little finger.”</p>
                     <p>“When I think of you fifty years ago, I must 
admit that you put a high standard, Molly,” 
interposed the Major, who was always polite when 
he was not angry.</p>
                     <p>“She spent a week with me while you were 
away,” Mrs. Lightfoot went on in an unchanged 
voice, though with a softened face, “and, I declare, 
she kept house as well as I could have done it 
myself, and Cupid says she washed the pink teases 
every morning with her own hands, and she actually
<pb n="83"/>
cured Rhody's lameness with a liniment she made out 
of Jimson weed. I tell you now, Mr. Lightfoot, that, if I 
get sick, Betty Ambler is the only girl I'm going to 
have inside the house.”</p>
                     <p>“Very well, my dear,” said the Major, meekly, “I'll 
try to remember; and, in that case, I reckon we'd as well 
drop a hint to Dan, eh, Molly?”</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Lightfoot looked at him a moment in silence. 
Then she said “Humph!” beneath her breath, and took 
up her knitting from the little table at her side.</p>
                     <p>But Dan was living fast at college, and the Major's 
hints were thrown away. He read of “the Ambler girls 
who are growing into real beauties,” and he skipped the 
part that said, “Your grandmother has taken a great 
fancy to Betty and enjoys having her about.”</p>
                     <p>“Here's something for you, Champe,” he remarked 
with a laugh, as he tossed the letter upon the table.       
“Gather your beauties while you may, for I prefer bull 
pups. Did Batt Horsford tell you I'd offered him 
twenty-five dollars for that one of his?”</p>
                     <p>Champe picked up the letter and unfolded it slowly. 
He was a tall, slender young fellow, with curling pale 
brown hair and fine straight features. His face, in the 
strong light of the window by which he stood, showed a 
tracery of blue veins across the high forehead.</p>
                     <p>“Oh, shut up about bull pups,” he said irritably.        
“You are as bad as a breeder, and yet you couldn't tell 
that thoroughbred of John Morson's from a cross with a 
terrier.”</p>
                     <p>“You bet I couldn't,” cried Dan, firing up; but 
Champe was reading the letter, and a faint flush
<pb n="84"/>
had risen to his face. “The girl is like a spray of 
golden-rod in the sunshine,” wrote the Major, with 
his old-fashioned rhetoric.</p>
                     <p>“What is it he says, eh?” asked Dan, noting the 
flush and drawing his conclusions.</p>
                     <p>“He says that Aunt Molly and himself will meet 
us at the White Sulphur next summer.”</p>
                     <p>“Oh, I don't mean that. What is it he says about 
the girls; they are real beauties aren't they? By the 
way, Champe, why don't you marry one of them and 
settle down?”</p>
                     <p>“Why don't you?” retorted Champe, as Dan got 
up and called to Big Abel to bring his riding clothes. 
“Oh, I'm not a lady's man,” he said lightly. “I've too 
moody a face for them,” and he began to dress 
himself with the elaborate care which had won for 
him the title of “Beau” Montjoy.</p>
                     <p>By the next summer, Betty and Virginia had shot 
up as if in a night, but neither Champe nor Dan came 
home. After weeks of excited preparation, the Major 
and Mrs. Lightfoot started, with Congo and Mitty, 
for the White Sulphur, where the boys were awaiting 
them. As the months went on, vague rumours reached 
the Governor's ears—rumours ours which the Major 
did not quite disprove when he came back in the 
autumn. “Yes, the boy is sowing his wild oats,” he 
said; “but what can you expect, Governor? Why, he 
is not yet twenty, and young blood is hot blood, sir.”</p>
                     <p>“I am sorry to hear that he has been losing at 
cards,” returned the Governor; “but take my advice, 
and let him pick himself up when he falls to hurt. 
Don't back him up, Major.”</p>
                     <pb n="85"/>
                     <p>“Pooh! pooh!” exclaimed the Major, testily.       
“You're like Molly, Governor, and, bless my soul, 
one old woman is as much as I can manage. Why, 
she wants me to let the boy starve.”</p>
                     <p>The Governor sighed, but he did not protest. He 
liked Dan, with all his youthful errors, and he 
wanted to put out a hand to hold him back from 
destruction; but he feared to bring the terrible flush 
to the Major's face. It was better to leave things 
alone, he thought, and so sighed and said nothing.</p>
                     <p>That was an autumn of burning political 
conditions, and the excited slavery debates in the 
North were reechoing through the Virginia 
mountains. The Major, like the old war horse that 
he was, had already pricked up his ears, and 
determined to lend his tongue or his sword, as his 
state might require. That a fight could go on in the 
Union so long as Virginia or himself kept out of it, 
seemed to him a possibility little less than 
preposterous.</p>
                     <p>“Didn't we fight the Revolution, sir? and didn't 
we fight the War of 1812? and didn't we fight the 
Mexican War to boot?” he would demand. “And, 
bless my soul, aren't we ready to fight all the 
Yankees in the universe, and to whip them clean 
out of the Union, too? Why, it wouldn't take us ten 
days to have them on their knees, sir.”</p>
                     <p>The Governor did not laugh now; the times were 
too grave for that. His clear eyes had seen whither 
they were drifting, and he had thrown his influence 
against the tide, which, he knew, would but sweep 
over him in the end. “You are out of place in 
Virginia Major,” he said seriously. “Virginia
<pb n="86"/>
wants peace, and she wants the Union. Go south, my 
dear sir, go south.”</p>
                     <p>During the spring before he had gone south 
himself to a convention at Montgomery, and he had 
spoken there against one of the greatest of the 
Southern orators. His state had upheld him, but the 
Major had not. He came home to find his old 
neighbour red with resentment, and refusing for the 
first few days to shake the hand of “a man who 
would tamper with the honour of Virginia.” At the 
end of the week the Major's hand was held out, but 
his heart still bore his grievance, and he began 
quoting William L. Yancey, as he had once quoted 
Mr. Addison. In the little meetings at Uplands or at 
Chericoke, he would now declaim the words of the 
impassioned agitator as vigorously as in the old days 
he had recited those of the polished gentleman of 
letters. The rector and the doctor would sit silent and 
abashed, and only the Governor would break in now 
and then with: “You go too far, Major. There is a 
step from which there is no drawing back, and that 
step means ruin to your state, sir.”</p>
                     <p>“Ruin, sir? Nonsense!  nonsense! We made the 
Union, and we'll unmake it when we please. We 
didn't make slavery; but, if Virginia wants slaves, by 
God, sir, she shall have slaves!”</p>
                     <p>It was after such a discussion in the Governor's 
library that the old gentleman rose one evening to 
depart in his wrath. “The man who sits up in my 
presence and questions my right to own my slaves is 
a damned black abolitionist, sir,” he thundered as he 
went, and by the time he reached his coach he was 
so blinded by his rage that Congo, the driver,
<pb n="87"/>
was obliged to lift him bodily into his seat. “Dis yer 
ain' no way ter do, Ole Marster,” said the negro, 
reproachfully. “How I gwine teck cyar you like Ole 
Miss done tole me, w'en you let yo' bile git ter yo' 
haid like dis? 'Tain' no way ter do, suh.”</p>
                     <p>The Major was too full for silence; and, ignoring 
the Governor, who had hurried out to beseech him 
to return, he let his rage burst forth.</p>
                     <p>“I can't help it, Congo, I can't help it!” he 
said. “They want to take you from me, do you hear? 
and that black Republican party up north wants to 
take you, too. They say I've no right to you, Congo, 
—bless my soul, and you were born on my own 
land!”</p>
                     <p>“Go 'way, Ole Marster, who gwine min' w'at dey 
say?” returned Congo, soothingly. “You des better 
wrop dat ar neck'chif roun' yo' thoat er Ole Miss'll 
git atter you sho' es you live!”</p>
                     <p>The Major wiped his eyes on the end of the 
neckerchief as he tied it about his throat. “But, if 
they elect their President, he may send down an 
army to free you,” he went on, with something like a 
sob of anger, “and I'd like to know what we'd do 
then, Congo.”</p>
                     <p>“Lawd, Lawd, suh,” said Congo, as he wrapped the 
robe about his master's knees. “Did you ever heah 
tell er sech doin's!” then, as he mounted the box, he 
leaned down and called out reassuringly, “Don' 
you min', Ole Marster, we'll des loose de dawgs on 
'em, dat's w'at we'll do,” and they rolled off 
indignantly, leaving the Governor half angry and 
half apologetic upon his portico.</p>
                     <p>It was on the way home that evening that Congo 
<pb n="88"/>
spied in the sassafras bushes beside the road a 
runaway slave of old Rainy-day Jones's, and 
descended, with a shout, to deliver his brother into 
bondage.</p>
                     <p>“Hi, Ole Marster, w'at I gwine tie him wid?” he 
demanded gleefully.</p>
                     <p>The Major looked out of the window, and his face 
went white.</p>
                     <p>“What's that on his cheek, Congo?” he asked in 
a whisper.</p>
                     <p>“Dat's des whar dey done hit 'im, Ole Marster. 
How I gwine tie 'im?”</p>
                     <p>But the Major had looked again, and the awful 
redness rose to his brow.</p>
                     <p>“Shut up, you fool!” he said with a roar, as he 
dived under his seat and brought out his brandy 
flask. “Give him a swallow of that—be quick, do 
you hear? Pour it into your cup, sir, and give him 
that corn pone in your pocket. I see it sticking out. 
There, now hoist him up beside you, and, if I meet 
that rascal Jones, I'll blow his damn brains out!”</p>
                     <p>The Major doubtless would have fulfilled his oath 
as surely as his twelve peers would have shaken his 
hand afterwards; but, by the time they came up with 
Rainy-day a mile ahead, his wrath had settled and he 
had decided that “he didn't want such dirty blood 
upon his hands.”</p>
                     <p>So he took a different course, and merely swore a 
little as he threw a roll of banknotes into the road.    
“Don't open your mouth to me, you hell hound,” he 
cried, “or I'll have you whipped clean out of this 
county, sir, and there's not a gentleman in Virginia 
that wouldn't lend a hand. Don't open your
<pb n="89"/>										
mouth to me, I tell you; here's the price of your 
property, and you can stoop in the dirt to pick it up. 
There's no man alive that shall question the divine 
right of slavery in my presence; but—but it is an 
institution for gentlemen, and you, sir, are a damned 
scoundrel!”</p>
                     <p>With which the Major and old Rainy-day rode on 
in opposite ways.</p>

                  <head>THE MAJOR'S CHRISTMAS</head>
                  <p>ON Christmas Eve the great logs blazed at 
Chericoke. From the open door the red light of the fire 
streamed through the falling snow upon the broad drive 
where the wheel ruts had frozen into ribbons of ice. The 
naked boughs of the old elms on the lawn tapped the 
peaked roof with twigs as cold and bright as steel, and 
the two high urns beside the steps had an iridescent 
fringe around their marble basins.</p>
                  <p>In the hall, beneath swinging sprays of mistletoe and 
holly. the Major and his hearty cronies were dipping 
apple toddy from the silver punch bowl half hidden in 
its wreath of evergreens. Behind them the panelled 
parlour was aglow with warmth. and on its shining 
wainscoting Great-aunt Emmeline under her Christmas 
garland, held her red apple stiffly away from the skirt of 
her amber brocade.</p>
                  <p>The Major, who had just filled the rector's glass, let 
the ladle fall with a splash, and hurried to the open 
door.</p>
                  <pb n="94"/>
                  <p>“ They're coming, Molly!” he called excitedly, “I 
hear their horses in the drive. No, bless my soul, it's 
wheels! The Governor's here, Molly! Fill their 
glasses at once—they'll be frozen through!”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot, who had been watching from the 
ivied panes of the parlour, rustled, with sharp 
exclamation, into the hall, and began hastily dipping 
from the silver punch bowl. “I really think, Mr. 
Lightfoot, that the house would be more comfortable 
if you'd be content to keep the front door closed,” she 
found time to remark. “Do take your glass by the 
fire, Mr. Blake; I declare, I positively feel the sleet in 
my face. Don't you think it would be just as 
hospitable, Mr. Lightfoot, to open to them when they 
knock?”</p>
                  <p>“What, keep the door shut on Christmas Eve, 
Molly!” exclaimed the Major from the front steps, 
where the snow was falling on his bare head. “Why, 
you're no better than a heathen. It's time you were 
learning your catechism over again. Ah, here they 
are, here they are! Come in, ladies, come in. The 
night is cold, but the welcome's warm.—Cupid, you 
fool, bring an umbrella, and don't stand grinning 
there.—Here, my dear Miss Lydia, take my arm, and 
never mind the weather; we've the best apple toddy 
in Virginia to warm you with, and the biggest log in 
the woods for you to look at. Ah, come in, come in,” 
and he led Miss Lydia, in her white wool “fascinator,” 
into the house where Mrs. Lightfoot stood waiting with 
open arms and the apple toddy. The Governor had insisted 
upon carrying his wife, lest she chill her
<pb n="95"/>
feet, and Betty and Virginia, in their long cloaks, 
fluttered across the snow and up the steps. As they 
reached the hall, the Major caught them in his arms and 
soundly kissed them. “It isn't Christmas every day, you 
know,” he lamented ruefully, “and even our friend Mr. 
Addison wasn't steeled against rosy cheeks, though he 
was but a poor creature who hadn't been to Virginia. But 
come to the fire, come to the fire. There's eggnog to your 
liking, Mr. Bill, and just a sip of this, Miss Lydia, to 
warm you up. You may defy the wind, ma'am, with a 
single sip of my apple toddy.” He seized the poker and, 
while Congo brought the glasses, prodded the giant log 
until the flames leaped, roaring, up the chimney and the 
wainscoting glowed deep red.</p>
                  <p>“What, not a drop, Miss Lydia?” he cried, in 
aggrieved tones, when he turned his back upon the fire.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lydia shook her head, blushing as she untied 
her “fascinator.” She was fond of apple toddy, but she 
regarded the taste as an indelicate one, and would as 
soon have admitted, before gentlemen, a liking for 
cabbage.</p>
                  <p>“Don't drink it, dear,” she whispered to Betty, as the 
girl took her glass; “it will give you a vulgar colour.”</p>
                  <p>Betty turned upon her the smile of beaming affection 
with which she always regarded her family. She was 
standing under the mistletoe in her light blue cloak and 
hood bordered with swan's-down, and her eyes shone 
like lamps in the bright pallor of her face.</p>
                  <p>“Why, it is delicious!” she said, with the pretty
<pb n="96"/>
effusion the old man loved. “It is better than my 
eggnog, isn't it, papa?”</p>
                  <p>“If anything can be better than your eggnog, my 
dear,” replied the Governor, courteously, “it is the 
Major's apple toddy.” The Major bowed, and Betty 
gave a merry little nod. “If you hadn't put it so 
nicely, I should never have forgiven you,” she 
laughed; “but he always puts it nicely, Major, 
doesn't he? I made him the other day a plum 
pudding of my very own,—I wouldn't even let Aunt 
Floretta seed the raisins,—and when it came on 
burnt, what do you think he said? Why, I asked him 
how he liked it, and he thought for a minute and 
replied, ‘My dear, it's the very best burnt plum 
pudding I ever ate.’ Now wasn't that dear of 
him?”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, but you should have heard how he put 
things when he was in politics,” said the Major, 
refilling his glass. “On my word, he could make the 
truth sound sweeter than most men could make a 
lie.”</p>
                  <p>“Come, come, Major,” protested the Governor.     
“Julia, can't you induce our good friend to forbear?”</p>
                  <p>“He knows I like to hear it,” said Mrs. Ambler, 
turning from a discussion of her Christmas dinner 
with Mrs. Lightfoot.</p>
                  <p>“Then you shall hear it, madam,” declared the 
Major, “and I may as well say at once that if the 
Governor hasn't told you about the reply he made 
to Plaintain Dudley when he asked him for his 
political influence, you haven't the kind of husband, 
ma'am, that Molly Lightfoot has got. Keep a
<pb n="97"/>
secret from Molly! Why, I'd as soon try to keep a 
keg full of brandy from following an auger.”</p>
                  <p>“Auger, indeed!” exclaimed the little old lady, to 
whom the Major's facetiousness was the only serious 
thing about him. “Your secrets are like apples, sir, 
that hang to every passer-by, until I store them 
away. Auger, indeed!”</p>
                  <p>“No offence, my dear,” was the Major's meek 
apology. “An auger is a very useful implement, eh, 
Governor; and it's Plaintain Dudley, after all, that 
we're concerned with. Do you remember Plaintain, 
Mrs. Ambler, a big ruddy fellow, with ruffled 
shirts? Oh, he prided himself on his shirts, did 
Plaintain!”</p>
                  <p>“A very becoming weakness,” said Mrs. Ambler, 
smiling at the Governor, who was blushing above 
his tucks.</p>
                  <p>“Becoming? Well, well, I dare say,” admitted 
the Major. “Plaintain thought so, at any rate. 
Why, I can see him now, on the day he came to the 
Governor, puffing out his front, and twirling his 
white silk handkerchief. ‘May I ask your opinion of 
me, sir?’ he had the audacity to begin, and the 
Governor! Bless my soul, ma'am, the Governor 
bowed his politest bow, and replied with his 
pleasantest smile, ‘My opinion of you, sir, is that 
were you as great a gentleman as you are a 
scoundrel, you would be a greater gentleman than 
my Lord Chesterfield.’ Those were his words, 
ma'am, on my oath, those were his words!”</p>
                  <p>“But he was a scoundrel!” exclaimed the 
Governor. “Why, he swindled women, Major. It 
was always a mystery to me how you tolerated 
him.”</p>
                  <pb n="98"/>
                  <p>“And a mystery to Mrs. Lightfoot,” responded the 
Major, in a half whisper; “but as I tell her, sir, you 
mustn't judge a man by his company, or a 'possum 
by his grin.” Then he raised a well-filled glass and 
gave a toast that brought even Mr. Bill upon his 
feet, “To Virginia, the home of brave men and,” he 
straightened himself, tossed back his hair, and 
bowed to the ladies, “and of angels.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor raised his glass with a smile. “To 
the angels who take pity upon the men,” he said.</p>
                  <p>“That more angels may take pity upon men,” 
added the rector, rising from his seat by the fireside, 
with a wink at the doctor.</p>
                  <p>And the toast was drunk, standing, while the girls 
ran up the crooked stair to lay aside their wraps in a 
three-cornered bedroom.</p>
                  <p>As Virginia threw off her pink cloak and twirled 
round in her flaring skirts, Betty gave a little gasp of 
admiration and stood holding the lighted candle, with 
its sprig of holly, above her head. The tall girlish 
figure, in its flounces of organdy muslin, with the 
smooth parting of bright brown hair and the dovelike 
eyes, had flowered suddenly into a beauty that took 
her breath away.</p>
                  <p>“Why, you are a vision—a vision!” she cried 
delightedly.</p>
                  <p>Virginia stopped short in her twirling and settled 
the illusion ruche over her slim white shoulders.  “It's 
the first time I've dressed like this, you know,” she 
said, glancing at herself in the dim old mirror.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, I'm not half so pretty,” sighed Betty, hopelessly.  
“Is the rose in place, do you think?”  She
<pb n="99"/>
had fastened a white rose in the thick coil on her 
neck, where it lay half hidden by her hair.</p>
                  <p>“It looks just lovely,” replied Virginia, heartily.    
“Do you hear some one in the drive?” She went to 
the window, and looked out into the falling snow, 
her bare shoulders shrinking from the frosted pane.  
“What a long ride the boys have had, and how cold 
they'll be. Why, the ground is quite covered with 
snow.” Betty, with the candle still in her hand, 
turned from the mirror, and gave a quick glance 
through the sloping window, to the naked elms 
outside. “Ah, poor things, poor things!” she cried.</p>
                  <p>“But they have their riding cloaks,” said 
Virginia, in her placid voice.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I don't mean Dan and Champe and Big 
Abel,” answered Betty, “I mean the elms, the poor 
naked elms that wear their clothes all summer, and 
are stripped bare for the cold. How I should like to 
warm you, you dear things,” she added, going to the 
window. Against the tossing branches her hair made 
a glow of colour, and her vivid face was warm with 
tenderness. “And Jane Lightfoot rode away on a 
night like this!” she whispered after a pause.</p>
                  <p>“She wore a muslin dress and a coral necklace, 
you know,” said Virginia, in the same low tone,      
“and she had only a knitted shawl over her head 
when she met Jack Montjoy at the end of the drive. 
He wrapped her in his cape, and they rode like mad 
to the town—and she was laughing! Uncle Shadrach 
met them in the road, and he says he heard her 
laughing in the wind. She must have been very 
wicked, mustn't she, Betty?”</p>
                  <pb n="100"/>
                  <p>But Betty was looking into the storm, and did not 
answer. “I wonder if he were in the least like Dan,” 
she murmured a moment later.</p>
                  <p>“Well, he had black hair, and Dan has that,” 
responded Virginia, lightly; “and he had a square 
chin, and Dan has that, too. Oh, every one says that 
Dan's the image of his father, except for the 
Lightfoot eyes. I'm glad he has the Lightfoot eyes, 
anyway. Are you ready to go down?”</p>
                  <p>Betty was ready, though her face had grown a 
little grave, and with a last look at the glass, they 
caught hands and went sedately down the winding 
stair.</p>
                  <p>In the hall below they met Mrs. Lightfoot, who 
sent Virginia into the panelled parlour, and bore 
Betty off to the kitchen to taste the sauce for the 
plum pudding. “I can't do a thing on earth with 
Rhody,” she remarked uneasily, throwing a knitted 
scarf over her head as they went from the back porch 
along the covered way that led to the brick kitchen.   
“She insists that yours is the only palate in all the 
country she will permit to pass judgment upon her 
sauce. I made the Major try it, and he thinks it needs 
a dash more of rum, but Rhody says she shan't be 
induced to change it until she has had your advice. 
Here, Rhody, open the door; I've brought your young 
lady.”</p>
                  <p>The door swung back with a jerk upon the big 
kitchen, where before the Christmas turkeys toasting 
on the spit, Aunt Rhody was striding to and fro 
like an Amazon in charcoal. From the beginning of 
the covered way they had been guided by the tones 
of penetrant contempt, with which she
<pb n="101"/>
lashed the circle of house servants who had gathered 
to her assistance. “You des lemme alont now,” was 
the advice she royally offered. “Ef you gwine ax me 
w'at you'd better do, I des tell you right now, you'd 
better lemme alont. Ca'line, you teck yo' eyes off dat 
ar roas' pig, er I'll fling dis yer b'ilin' lard right spang  
on you. I ain' gwine hev none er my cookin' conjured 
fo' my ve'y face. Congo, you shet dat mouf er yourn, 
er I'll shet hit wid er flat-iron, en den hit'll be shet ter 
stay.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as Mrs. Lightfoot and Betty came in, she 
broke off, and wiped her large black hands on her 
apron, before she waved with pride to the shelves 
and tables bending beneath her various creations.     
“I'se done stuff dat ar pig so full er chestnuts dat he's 
fitten ter bus',” she exclaimed proudly. “Lawd, 
Lawd, hit's a pity he ain' 'live agin des ter tase 
hese'f!”</p>
                  <p>“Poor little pig,” said Betty, “he looks so small and 
pink, Aunt Rhody, I don't see how you have the heart 
to roast him.”</p>
                  <p>“I'se done stuff `im full,” returned Aunt Rhody, 
in justification .</p>
                  <p>“I hope he's well done, Rhody,” briskly broke 
in Mrs. Lightfoot; “and be sure to bake the hams 
until the juice runs through the bread crumbs. Is 
everything ready for to-morrow?” </p>
                  <p>“Des es ready es ef  'twuz fer Kingdom Come, 
Ole Miss, en dar ain' gwine be no better dinner on 
Jedgment Day nurr, I don' cyar who gwine cook hit. 
You des tase dis yer sass—dat's all I ax, you des 
tase dis yer sass.”</p>
                  <p>“You taste it, Betty,” begged Mrs. Lightfoot,
<pb n="102"/>
shrinking from the approaching spoon; and Betty 
tasted and pronounced it excellent, “and there never 
was an Ambler who wasn't a judge of ‘sass,’” she 
added.</p>
                  <p>Moved by the compliment, Aunt Rhody fell back 
and regarded the girl, with her arms akimbo. “I 
d'clar, her eyes do des shoot fire,” she exclaimed 
admiringly. “I dunno whar de beaux done hid 
deyse'ves dese days; hit's a wonner dey ain' des 
a-busin' dey sides ter git yer. Marse Dan, now, 
whynt he come a-prancin' roun' dese yer parts?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot looked at Betty and saw her colour 
rise. “That will do, Rhody,” she cautioned; “you 
will let the turkeys burn,” but as they moved toward 
the door, Betty herself paused and looked back.</p>
                  <p>“I gave your Christmas gift to Uncle Cupid, Aunt 
Rhody,” she said; “he put it under the joists in your 
cabin, so you mustn't look at it till morning.”</p>
                  <p>“Lawd, chile, I'se done got Christmas gifts afo' 
now,” replied Aunt Rhody, ungratefully, “en I'se 
done got a pa'cel er no count ones, too. Folks dey 
give Christmas gifts same es de Lawd he give 
chillun—dey des han's out w'at dey's got on dey 
han's, wid no stiddyin' 'bout de tase. Sakes er live! 
Ef'n de Lawd hadn't hed a plum sight ter git rid er, 
he 'ouldn't er sont Ca'line all dose driblets, fo' he'd 
done sont 'er a husban'.”</p>
                  <p>“Husban', huh!”  exclaimed Ca'line, with a snort 
from the fireplace. “Husban' yo'se'f! No mo' 
niggerisms fer me, ma'am!” </p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongue, Ca'line,” said Mrs. 
Lightfoot, sternly; “and, Rhody, you ought to be
<pb n="103"/>
ashamed of yourself to talk so before your Miss 
Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“Husban', huh!”  repeated the indignant Ca'line, 
under her breath.</p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongues, both of you,” cried the old 
lady, as she lifted her silk skirt in both hands and 
swept from the kitchen.</p>
                  <p>When they reached the house again, they heard 
the Major's voice, on its highest key, demanding:      
“Molly! Why, bless my soul, what's become of 
Molly?”  He was calling from the front steps, and 
the sound of tramping feet rang in the drive below. 
Against the whiteness of the storm Big Abel's face 
shone in the light from the open door, and about 
him, as he held the horses, Dan and Champe and a 
guest or two were dismounting upon the steps.</p>
                  <p>As the old lady went forward, Champe rushed into 
the hall, and caught her in his arms.</p>
                  <p>“On my word, you're so young I didn't know 
you,” he cried gayly. “If you keep this up, Aunt 
Molly, there'll be a second Lightfoot beauty yet. 
You grow prettier every day—I declare you do!” </p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongue, you scamp,” said the old 
lady, flushing with pleasure, “or there'll be a second 
Ananias as well. Here, Betty, come and wish this 
bad boy a Merry Christmas.”</p>
                  <p>Betty looked round with a smile, but as she did so, 
her eyes went beyond Champe, and saw Dan 
standing in the doorway, his soft slouch hat in his 
hand, and a powdering of snow on his dark hair. He 
had grown bigger and older in the last few months, 
and the Lightfoot eyes, with the Lightfoot twinkle in 
their pupils, gave an expression of careless
<pb n="104"/>
humour to his pale, strongly moulded face. The same 
humour was in his voice even as he held his 
grandfather's hand.</p>
                  <p>“By George, we're glad to get here,” was his 
greeting. “Morson's been cursing our hospitality for 
the last three miles. Grandpa, this is my friend 
Morson—Jack Morson, you've heard me speak of 
him; and this is Bland Diggs, you know of him, too.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, to be sure, to be sure,” cried the Major, 
heartily, as he held out both hands. “You're 
welcome, gentlemen, as welcome as Christmas—what 
more can I say? But come in, come in to the fire. 
Cupid, the glasses!” </p>
                  <p>“Ah, the ladies first,” suggested Dan, lightly;       
“grace before meat, you know. So here you are, 
grandma, cap and all. And Virginia;—ye gods! -is 
this little Virginia?”</p>
                  <p>His laughing eyes were on her as she stood, tall 
and lovely, beneath a Christmas garland, and with 
the laughter still in them, they blazed with approval 
of her beauty. “Oh, but do you know, how did you 
do it?”  he demanded with his blithe confidence, as 
if it mattered very little how his words were met.</p>
                  <p>“It wasn't any trouble, believe me,” responded 
Virginia, blushing, “not half so much trouble as you 
took to tie your neckerchief.”</p>
                  <p>Dan's hand went to his throat. “Then I may 
presume that it is mere natural genius,” he 
exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“Genius, to grow tall?” </p>
                  <p>“Well, yes, just that—to grow tall,” then he
<pb n="105"/>
caught sight of Betty, and held out his hand again.    
“And you, little comrade, you haven't grown up to 
the world, I see.”</p>
                  <p>Betty laughed and looked him over with the smile 
the Major loved. “I content myself with merely 
growing up to you,” she returned.</p>
                  <p>“Up to me? Why, you barely reach my 
shoulder.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, up to the greater part of you, at least.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, up to my heart,” said Dan, and Betty 
coloured beneath the twinkle in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>The colour was still in her face when the Major 
came out, with Mrs. Ambler on his arm, and led the 
way to supper.</p>
                  <p>“All of us are hungry, and some of us have a 
day's ride behind us,” he remarked, as, after the 
rector's grace, he stood waving the carving-knife 
above the roasted turkey. “I'd like to know how 
often during the last hour you've thought of this 
turkey, Mr. Morson?”</p>
                  <p>“It has had a fair share of my thoughts, I'm 
forced to admit, Major,” responded Jack Morson, 
readily. He was a hearty, light-haired young fellow, 
with a girlish complexion and pale blue eyes, as 
round as marbles. “As fair a share as the apple 
toddy has had of Diggs's, I'll be bound.”</p>
                  <p>“Apple toddy!”  protested Diggs, turning his 
serious face, flushed from the long ride, upon the 
Major. “I was too busy thinking we should never 
get here; and we were lost once, weren't we, Beau?”  
he asked of Dan.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I for one am safely housed for the night, 
doctor?” declared the rector, with an uneasy glance
<pb n="106"/>
through the window, “and I trust that Mrs. Blake's 
reproach will melt before the snow does. But what's 
that about being lost, Dan?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, we got off the road,” replied Dan; “but I 
gave Prince Rupert the rein and he brought us in. 
The sense that horse has got makes me fairly 
ashamed of going to college in his place; and I may 
as well warn you, Mr. Blake, that when I get ready 
to go to Heaven, I shan't seek your guidance at 
all—I'll merely nose Prince Rupert at the Bible and 
give him his head.”</p>
                  <p>“It's a comfort to know, at least, that you won't 
be trusting to your own deserts, my boy,” responded 
the rector, who dearly loved his joke, as he helped 
himself to yellow pickle.</p>
                  <p>“Let us hope that the straight and narrow way is 
a little clearer than the tavern road to-night,” said 
Champe. “I'm afraid you'll have trouble getting 
back, Governor.”</p>
                  <p>“Afraid!”  took up the Major, before the 
Governor could reply. “Why, where are your 
manners, my lad? It will be no ill wind that keeps 
them beneath our roof. We'll make room for you, 
ladies, never fear; the house will stretch itself to fit 
the welcome, eh, Molly?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot, looking a little anxious, put 
forward a hearty assent; but the Governor laughed 
and threw back the Major's hospitality as easily as it 
was proffered.</p>
                  <p>“I know that your welcome's big enough to 
hold us, my dear Major,” he said; “but Hosea's 
driving us, you see, and he could take us along the 
turnpike blindfold. Why, he actually discovered
<pb n="107"/>
in passing just before the storm that somebody had 
dug up a sugar berry bush from the corner of your 
old rail fence.”</p>
                  <p>“And we really must get back,” insisted Mrs. 
Ambler, “we haven't even fixed the servants' 
Christmas, and Betty has to fill the stockings for the 
children in the quarters.”</p>
                  <p>“Then if you will go, go you shall,” cried the 
Major, as heartily as he had pressed his invitation.   
“You shall get back, ma'am, if I have to go before 
you with a shovel and clear the snow away. So just 
a bit more of this roast pig, just a bit, Governor. My 
dear Miss Lydia, I beg you to try that spiced 
beef—and you, Mr. Bill?—Cupid, Mr. Bill will 
have a piece of roast pig.”</p>
                  <p>By the time the Tokay was opened, the Major had 
grown very jolly, and he began to exchange jokes 
with the Governor and the rector. Mr. Bill and the 
doctor, neither of whom could have told a story for 
his life, listened with a kind of heavy gravity; and 
the young men, as they rattled off a college tale or 
two, kept their eyes on Betty and Virginia.</p>
                  <p>Betty, leaning back in her high mahogany chair, 
and now and then putting in a word with the bright 
effusion which belonged to her, gave ear half to the 
Major's anecdotes, and half to a jest of Jack 
Morson's. Before her branched a silver 
candelabrum, and beyond it, with the light in his 
face, Dan was sitting. She watched him with a frank 
curiosity from eyes, where the smile, with which she 
had answered the Major, still lingered in a gleam of 
merriment. There was a puzzled wonder in her
<pb n="108"/>
mind that Dan—the Dan of her childhood—should 
have become for her, of a sudden, but a strong, 
black-haired stranger from whom she shrank with a 
swift timidity. She looked at Champe's high 
blue-veined forehead and curling brown hair; he was 
still the big boy she had played with; but when she 
went back to Dan, the wonder returned with a kind of 
irritation, and she felt that she should like to shake 
him and have it out between them as she used to do 
before he went away. What was the meaning of it? 
Where the difference? As he sat across from her, with 
his head thrown back and his eyes dark with laughter, 
her look questioned him half humorously, half in 
alarm. From his broad brow to his strong hand, 
playing idly with a little heap of bread crumbs, she 
knew that she was conscious of his presence—with a 
consciousness that had quickened into a living thing.</p>
                  <p>To Dan, himself, her gaze brought but the 
knowledge that her smile was upon him, and he met 
her question with lifted eyebrows and perplexed 
amusement. What he had once called “the Betty look” 
was in her face,—so kind a look, so earnest yet so 
humorous, with a sweet sane humour at her own 
bewilderment, that it held his eyes an instant before 
they plunged back to Virginia—an instant only, but 
long enough for him to feel the thrill of an impulse 
which he did not understand. Dear little Betty, he 
thought, tenderly, and went back to her sister.</p>
                  <p>The next moment he was telling himself that 
“the girl was a tearing beauty.” He liked that modest 
droop of her head and those bashful soft eyes, as
<pb n="109"/>
if, by George. as if she were really afraid of him. Or 
was it Champe or Jack Morson that she bent her 
bewitching glance upon?  Well, Champe, or 
Morson, or himself, in a week they would all be over 
head and ears in love with her, and let him win who 
might. It was mere folly, of course, to break one's 
heart over a girl, and there was no chance of that so 
long as he had his horses and the bull pups to fall 
back upon; but she was deucedly pretty, and if he 
ever came to the old house to live it would be rather 
jolly to have her about. He would be twenty-one by 
this time next year, and a man of twenty-one was 
old enough to settle down a bit. In the meantime he 
laughed and met Virginia's eye, and they both 
blushed and looked away quickly.</p>
                  <p>But when they left the dining room an hour later, it 
was not Virginia that Dan sought. He had learned 
the duties of hospitality in the Major's school, and so 
he sat down beside Miss Lydia and asked her about 
her window garden, while Jack Morson made 
desperate love to his beautiful neighbour. Once, 
indeed, he drew Betty aside for an instant, but it was 
only to whisper: “Look here, you'll be real nice to 
Diggs, won't you? He's bashful, you know, and 
besides he's awfully poor, and works like the devil. 
You make him enjoy his holidays, and I—well, yes, 
I'll let that fox get away next week, I declare I will.”</p>
                  <p>“All right,” agreed Betty, “it's a bargain. Mr. 
Diggs shall have a merry Christmas, and the fox 
shall have his life. You'll keep faith with me?”</p>
                  <p>“Sworn,” said Dan, and he went back to Miss 
Lydia, while Betty danced a reel with young Diggs,
<pb n="110"/>
who fell in love with her before he was an hour 
older. The terms cost him his heart, perhaps, but 
there was a life at stake, and Betty, who had not a 
touch of the coquette in her nature, would have 
flirted open-eyed with the rector could she have 
saved a robin from the shot. As for Diggs, he might 
have been a family portrait or a Christmas garland 
for all the sentiment she gave him.</p>
                  <p>When she went upstairs some hours later to put on 
her wraps, she had forgotten, indeed, that Diggs or 
his emotion was in existence. She tied on her blue 
hood with the swan's-down, and noticed, as she did 
so, that the white rose was gone from her hair. “I 
hope I lost it after supper,” she thought rather 
wistfully, for it was becoming; and then she slipped 
into her long cloak and started down again. It was 
not until she reached the bend in the staircase, where 
the tall clock stood, that she looked over the 
balustrade and saw Dan in the hall below with the 
white rose in his hand.</p>
                  <p>She had come so softly that he had not heard her 
step. The light from the candelabra was full upon 
him, and she saw the half-tender, half-quizzical look 
in his face. For an instant he held the white rose 
beneath his eyes, then he carefully folded it in his 
handkerchief and hid it in the pocket of his coat. As 
he did so, he gave a queer little laugh and went 
quickly back into the panelled parlour, while Betty 
glowed like a flower in the darkened bend of the 
staircase.</p>
                  <p>When they called her and she came down the 
bright colour was still in her face, and her eyes were 
shining happily under the swan's-down border of
<pb n="111"/>
her hood. “This little lady isn't afraid of the cold,” 
said the Major, as he pinched her cheeks. “Why, 
she's as warm as a toast, and, bless my soul, if I were 
thirty years younger, I'd ride twenty miles tonight to 
catch a glimpse of her in that bonny blue hood. Ah, 
in my day, men were men, sir.”</p>
                  <p>Dan, who had come back from escorting Miss 
Lydia to the carriage, laughed and held out his arms.</p>
                  <p>“Let me carry you, Betty; I'll show grandpa that 
there's still a man alive.”</p>
                  <p>“No, sir, no,” said Betty, as she stood on tiptoe 
and held her cheek to the Major. “You haven't a 
chance when your grandfather's by. There, I'll let 
you carry the sleeping draught for Aunt Pussy; but 
my flounces, no, never!” and she ran past him and 
slipped into the carriage beside Mrs. Ambler and 
Miss Lydia.</p>
                  <p>In a moment Virginia came out under an umbrella 
that was held by Jack Morson, and the carriage 
rolled slowly along the drive, while the young men 
stood, bareheaded, in the falling snow.</p>
                  <p>“Keep a brave heart, Morson,” said Champe, with 
a laugh, as he ran back into the house, where the 
Major waited to bar the door, “remember, you've 
known her but three hours, and stand it like a man. 
Well I'm off to bed,” and he lighted his candle and, 
with a gay “good night,” went whistling up the stair.</p>
                  <p>In Dan's bedroom, where he had crowded for the 
holidays, he found his cousin, upon the hearth-rug, 
looking abstractedly into the flames.</p>
                  <p>As Champe entered he turned, with the poker in
<pb n="112"/>
his hand, and spoke out of the fulness of his heart: -</p>
                  <p>“She's a beauty, I declare she is.”</p>
                  <p>Champe broke short his whistling, and threw off 
his coat.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I dare say she was fifty years ago,” he 
rejoined gravely.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, don't be an utter ass; you know I mean 
Virginia.”</p>
                  <p>“My dear boy, I had supposed Miss Lydia to be 
the object of your attentions. You mustn't be a Don 
Juan, you know, you really mustn't. Spare the sex, I 
entreat.”</p>
                  <p>Dan aimed a blow at him with a boot that was 
Iying on the rug. “Shut up, won't you,” he growled.</p>
                  <p>“Well, Virginia is a beauty,” was Champe's 
amiable response. “Jack Morson swears Aunt 
Emmeline's line's picture can't touch her. He's 
writing to his father now, I don't doubt, to say he 
can't live without her. Go down, and he'll read you 
the letter.”</p>
                  <p>Dan's face grew black. “I'll thank him to mind his 
own business,” he grumbled.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, he thinks he's doing it.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, his business isn't either of the Ambler girls, 
and I'll have him to know it. What right has he got, 
I'd like to know, to come up here and fall in love 
with our neighbours.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Beau, Beau! Why, it was only last week you 
ran him away from Batt Horsford's daughter. Are 
you going in for a general championship?”</p>
                  <p>“The devil! Sally Horsford's a handsome girl, and 
a good girl, too; and I'll fight any man who
<pb n="113"/>
says she isn't. By George, a woman's a woman, if 
she is a stableman's daughter!” </p>
                  <p>“Bravo!”  cried Champe, with a whistle, “there 
spoke the Lightfoot.”</p>
                  <p>“She's a good girl,” repeated Dan, furiously, as 
he flung the other boot at his cousin. Champe 
caught the boot, and carefully set it beside the door. 
“Well, she's welcome to be, as far as I'm 
concerned,” he replied calmly. “Turn not your 
speaking eye upon me. I harbour no dark intent, Sir 
Galahad.”</p>
                  <p>“Damn Sir Galahad!”  said Dan, and blew out the 
light.</p>

                  <head>BETTY DREAMS BY THE FIRE</head>
                  <p>BETTY, lying back in the deep old carriage as it 
rolled through the storm, felt a glow at her hear as if 
a lamp were burning there, shut in from the night. 
Above the wind and the groaning of the wheels, she 
heard Hosea calling to the horses, but the sound 
reached her through muffled ears.</p>
                  <p>“Git along dar!”  cried Hosea, with sudden 
spirit, “dar ain' no oats dis side er home, en dar ain' 
no co'n, nurr. Git along dar! 'Tain' no use a-mincin'. 
Git along dar!”</p>
                  <p>The snow beat softly on the windows, and the 
Governor's profile was relieved, fine and straight, 
against the frosted glass. “Are you asleep, 
daughter?”  he asked, turning to where the girl lay in 
her dark corner.</p>
                  <p>“Asleep!” She came back with a start, and caught 
his hand above the robe in her demonstrative way. 
“Why, who can sleep on Christmas Eve? there's too 
much to do, isn't there, mamma? Twenty stockings to 
fill and I don't know how many bundles to tie up. Oh, 
no, I shan't sleep tonight.”</p>
                  <p>“We might get up early to-morrow and do them,” 
suggested Virginia, nodding in her pink hood.</p>
                  <pb n="115"/>
                  <p>“You, at least, must go to bed, dear,” insisted 
Mrs. Ambler. “Betty and I will fix the things.”</p>
                  <p>“Indeed, you shall go to bed, mamma,” said 
Betty, sternly. “Papa and I shall make Christmas 
this year. You'll help me, won't you, papa?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, my dear, I don't see how I can help myself,” 
returned the Governor; “I wasn't born to be the 
father of a Betty for nothing.”</p>
                  <p>“Get along dar!” sang out Hosea again. “'Tain' 
no use a-mincin', gemmun. Dar ain' no fiddlin' 
roun'.  Git along dar!”</p>
                  <p>Miss Lydia had fallen asleep, with her head on 
her breast, but the sound aroused her, and she 
opened her eyes and sat up very straight.</p>
                  <p>“Why, I declare I'd almost dropped off,” she said.  
“Are we nearly there, Peyton?”</p>
                  <p>“I think so,” replied the Governor, “but the 
snow's so thick I can't see;” he opened the window 
and put out his head. “Are we nearly there, 
Hosea?”</p>
                  <p>“We des done pas' de clump er cedars, suh,” 
yelled Hosea through the storm. “I'ud a knowd 'em 
ef dey'd come a-struttin' down de road—dey cyarn 
fool me. Den we got ter pas' de wil' cher'y and de 
gap in de fence, en dar we are.”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, we're nearly there,” said the Governor, as 
he drew in his head, and Miss Lydia slept again 
until the carriage turned into the drive and stopped 
before the portico.</p>
                  <p>Uncle Shadrach, in the open doorway, was 
grinning with delight. “Ef'n de snow had er kep' 
you, dar 'ouldn't a been no Christmas for de res' er 
us,” he declared.</p>
                  <pb n="116"/>
                  <p>“Oh, the snow couldn't keep us, Shadrach,” 
returned the Governor, as he gave him his overcoat, 
and set himself to unfastening his wife's wraps. “We 
were too anxious to get home. There, Julia, you go to 
bed, and leave Betty and myself to manage things. 
Don't say I can't do it. I tell you I've been Governor 
of Virginia, and I'll not be daunted by an empty 
stocking. Now go away, and you, too, Virginia—you're 
as sleepy as a kitten. Miss Lydia, shall I take Mrs. 
Lightfoot's mixture to Miss Pussy, or will you?”</p>
                  <p>Miss Lydia took the pitcher, and Betty put her 
arm about her mother and led her upstairs, holding 
her hand and kissing it as she went. She was always 
lavish with little ways of love, but to-night she felt 
tenderer than ever—she felt that she should like to 
take the world in her arms and hold it to her bosom. 
“Dearest, sweetest,” she said, and her voice was full 
and tremulous, though still with its crisp brightness 
of tone. It was as if she caressed with her whole 
being, with those hidden possibilities of passion 
which troubled her yet, only as the vibration, of 
strong music, making her joy pensive and her 
sadness sweet. She felt that she was walking in a 
pleasant and vivid dream; she was happy, she could 
not tell why; nor could she tell why she was 
sorrowful.</p>
                  <p>In Mrs. Ambler's room they found Mammy Riah, 
awaiting her mistress's return.</p>
                  <p>“Put her to bed, Mammy,” she said; “she is all 
chilled by the drive,” and she gave her mother over 
to the old regress, and ran down again to the
<pb n="117"/>
dining room, where the Governor was standing 
surrounded by the Christmas litter.</p>
                  <p>“Do you expect to straighten out all these things, 
daughter?”  he asked hopelessly.</p>
                  <p>“Why, there's hardly anything left to do,”
was Betty's cheerful assurance. “You just sit
down at the table and put the nuts into the toes
of those stockings, and I'll count out these print
frocks.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor obediently sat down and went to 
work. “I am moved to offer thanks that we are not 
as the beasts that have four legs,” he remarked 
thoughtfully. “I shouldn't care to fill stockings for 
quadrupeds, Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, you goose, there's only one stocking for 
each child.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, but with four feet our expectations might be 
doubled,” suggested the Governor. “You can't 
convince me that it isn't a merciful providence, my 
dear.”</p>
                  <p>When the stockings were filled and the packages 
neatly tied up and separated, Uncle Shadrach came 
with a hamper, and Betty went out to the kitchen to 
prepare for the morning gathering of the field hands 
and their families. Returning after the work was 
over. she lingered a moment in the path to the 
house, looking far across the white country. The 
snow had ceased, and a single star was shining, 
through a rift in the scudding clouds, straight 
overhead. From the northwest the wind blew hard, 
and the fleecy covering on the ground was fast 
freezing a foot deep in ice. With a shiver she drew 
her cloak about her and ran indoors and upstairs
<pb n="118"/>
to where Virginia lay asleep in the high, white bed.</p>
                  <p>In the great brick fireplace the logs had fallen 
apart, and she softly pushed them together again as 
she threw on a knot of resinous pine. The blaze shot 
up quickly, and blowing out the candle upon the 
bureau, she undressed by the firelight, crooning 
gently as she did so in a voice that was lower than 
the singing flames. With the glow on her bared arms 
and her hair unbound upon her shoulders, she sat 
close against the chimney; and while Virginia slept 
in the tester bed, went dreaming out into the night.</p>
                  <p>At first her dreams went back into her childhood, 
and somehow, she knew not why, she could not 
bring back her childhood but Dan came with it. She 
fancied herself in all kinds of impossible places, 
but she had no sooner got safely into them than she 
looked up and Dan was there before her, standing 
very still and laughing at her with his eyes. It 
was the same thing even when she was a baby. Her 
earliest memory was of a May morning when they 
took her out into a field of buttercups, and told 
her that she might pluck her arms full if she could, 
and then, as she stretched out her little hands and 
began to gather very fast, she looked across to 
where the waving yellow buttercups stood up against 
the blue spring sky. That memory had always been 
her own before; but now, when she went back to it, 
she knew that all the time she had been gathering 
buttercups for Dan. And she had plucked faster and 
faster only that she might have a bigger bunch for 
him when the gathering was done. She
<pb n="119"/>
saw herself working bonnetless in the sunshine, her 
baby face red, her lips breathless, working so hard, 
she did not know for whom. Oh, how funny that he 
should have been somewhere all the time!</p>
                  <p>And again on the day when they gave her her first 
doll, and she let it fall and cried her heart out over its 
broken pink face. She knew, at last, that somewhere 
in that ugly town Dan had dropped his toy; and it 
was for that she was crying, not for her own poor 
doll. Yes, all her life she had had two griefs to weep 
for, and two joys to be glad over. She had been 
really a double self from her babyhood up—from her 
babyhood up! It had been always up, up, up—like a 
lark that rises to the sun. She had all her life been 
rising to the sun, and she was warmed at last.</p>
                  <p>Then she asked herself if it were happiness, after all, 
this new restlessness of hers. The melancholy of the 
early spring was there—the roving impulse that 
comes on April afternoons when the first buds are on 
the trees and the air is keen with the smell of the 
newly turned earth. She felt that it was time for the 
spring to come again; she wanted to walk alone in 
the woods and to watch the swallows flying from the 
north. And again she wanted only to lie close upon 
the hearth and to hear the flames leap up the 
chimney. One of her selves cried to be up and 
roaming; the other to turn over on the rug and sleep 
again.</p>
                  <p>But gradually her thoughts returned to him, and 
she went over, bit by bit, what he had said last 
evening, asking herself if he had meant much at this
<pb n="120"/>
time, or little at another. It seemed to her that she 
found new meanings now in things that she had once 
overlooked. She read words in his eyes which he had 
never spoken; and, one by one, she brought back 
each sentence, each look, each gesture, holding it up 
to her remembrance, and laying it aside to give place 
to the next. Oh, there were so many, so many! </p>
                  <p>And then from the past her dreams went groping 
out into the future, becoming dimmer, and shaping 
themselves into unreal forms. Scattered visions came 
drifting through her mind,—of herself in romantic 
adventures, and of Dan—always of Dan—appearing 
like the prince in the fairy tale, at the perilous 
moment. She saw herself on the breast of a great 
river, borne, while she stretched her hands at a 
white rose-bush blooming in the clouds, to a cataract 
which she could not see, though she heard its thunder 
far ahead. She tried to call, but no sound came, for 
the water filled her mouth. The river went on and on, 
and the falling of the cataract was in her ears, when 
she felt Dan's arm about her, and saw his eyes 
laughing at her above the waters.</p>
                  <p>“Betty!” called Virginia, suddenly, rising on her 
elbow and rubbing her eyes. “Betty, is it morning?”</p>
                  <p>Betty awoke with a cry, and stood up in the 
firelight.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, no. not yet,” she answered.</p>
                  <p>“What are you doing? Aren't you coming to bed?”</p>
                  <p>“I—I was just thinking,” stammered Betty.
<pb n="121"/>
twisting her hair into a rope; “yes, I'm coming 
now,” and sue crossed the room and climbed into 
the bed beside her sister.</p>
                  <p>“I believe I fell asleep by the fire,” she said, as 
she turned over.</p>

                  <head>DAN AND BETTY</head>
                  <p>ON the last day of the year the young men from 
Chericoke, as they rode down the turnpike, came 
upon Betty bringing holly berries from the wood. She 
was followed by two small negroes laden with 
branches, and beside her ran her young setters, 
Peyton and Bill.</p>
                  <p>As Dan came up with her, he checked his horse and 
swung himself to the ground. “Thank God I've 
passed the boundary!” he exclaimed over his 
shoulder to the others. “Ride on, my lads, ride on! 
Don't prate of the claims of hospitality to me. My 
foot is on my neighbours' heath; I'm host to no 
man.”</p>
                  <p>“Come, now, Beau,” remonstrated Jack Morson, 
looking down from his saddle; “I see in Miss Betty's 
eyes that she wants me to carry that holly—I swear 
I do.”</p>
                  <p>“Then you see more than is written,” declared 
Champe, from the other side, “for it's as plain as 
day that one eye says Diggs and one Lightfoot—isn't 
it, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>Betty looked up, laughing. “If you are so 
skilled in foreign tongues, what can I answer?” 
she asked. “Only that I've been a mile after this 
holly for the party to-night, and I
<pb n="123"/>
wouldn't trust it to all of you together—for 
worlds.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, go on, go on,” said Dan, impatiently,           
“doesn't that mean that she'll trust it to me alone? 
Good morning, my boys, God be with you,” and he 
led Prince Rupert aside while the rest rode by.</p>
                  <p>When they were out of sight he turned to one of the 
small negroes, his hand on the bridle. “Shall we 
exchange burdens, O eater of 'possums?” he asked 
blandly. “Will you permit me to tote your load, 
while you lead my horse to the house? You aren't 
afraid of him, are you?”</p>
                  <p>The little negro grinned. “He do look moughty 
glum, suh,” he replied, half fearfully.</p>
                  <p>“Glum! Why, the amiability in that horse's face is 
enough to draw tears. Come up, Prince Rupert, your 
highness is to go ahead of me; it's to oblige a lady, 
you know.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as Prince Rupert was led away, Dan looked 
at Betty.</p>
                  <p>“Shall it be the turnpike or the meadow path?”  
he inquired, with the gay deference he used toward 
women, as if a word might turn it to a jest or a look 
might make it earnest.</p>
                  <p>“The meadow, but not the path,” replied the girl; 
“the path is asleep under the snow.” She cast a 
happy glance over the white landscape, down the 
long turnpike, and across the broad meadow where a 
cedar tree waved like a snowy plume. “Jake, we 
must climb the wall,” she added to the negro boy, 
“be careful about the berries.”</p>
                  <p>Dan threw his holly into the meadow and lifted 
Betty upon the stone wall. “Now wait a moment,”
<pb n="124"/>
he cautioned, as he went over. “Don't move till I tell 
you. I'm managing this job—there, now jump!”</p>
                  <p>He caught her hands and set her on her feet beside 
him. “Take your fence, my beauties,” he called 
gayly to the dogs, as they came bounding across the 
turnpike.</p>
                  <p>Betty straightened her cap and took up her 
berries.</p>
                  <p>“Your tender mercies are rather cruel,” she 
complained, as she did so. “Even my hair is 
undone.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it's all the better,” returned Dan, without 
looking at her. “I don't see why girls make 
themselves so smooth, anyway. That's what I like 
about you, you know—you've always got a screw 
loose somewhere.”</p>
                  <p>“But I haven't,” cried Betty, stopping in the snow.
“What! if I find a curl where it oughtn't to be, 
may I have it?”</p>
                  <p>“Of course not,” she answered indignantly.</p>
                  <p>“Well, there's one hanging over your ear now. 
Shall I put it straight with this piece of holly? My 
hands are full, but I think I might manage it.”</p>
                  <p>“Don't touch me with your holly!”  exclaimed 
Betty, walking faster; then in a moment she turned 
and stood calling to the dogs. “Have you noticed 
what beauties Bill and Peyton have grown to be?”  
she questioned pleasantly. “There weren't any boys 
to be named after papa and Uncle Bill, so I called 
the dogs after them, you know. Papa says he would 
rather have had a son named Peyton; but I
<pb n="125"/>
tell him the son might have been wicked and brought 
his hairs in sorrow to the grave.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I dare say, you're right,” he stopped with a 
sweep of his hand, and stood looking to where a 
flock of crows were flying over the dried spectres of 
carrot flowers that stood up above the snow; “That's 
fine, now, isn't it?”  he asked seriously.</p>
                  <p>Betty followed his gesture, then she gave a little cry 
and threw her arms round the dogs. “The poor 
crows are so hungry,” she said. “No, no, you 
mustn't chase them, Bill and Peyton, it isn't right, 
you see. Here, Jake, come and hold the dogs, while I 
feed the crows.”  She drew a handful of corn from 
the pocket of her cloak, and flung it out into the 
meadow.</p>
                  <p>“I always bring corn for them,” she explained;     
“they get so hungry, and sometimes they starve to 
death right out here. Papa says they are pernicious 
birds; but I don't care—do you mind their being 
pernicious?”</p>
                  <p>“I? Not in the least. I assure you I trouble 
myself very little about the morals of my associates. 
I'm not fond of crows; but it is their voices rather 
than their habits I object to. I can't stand their 
eternal 'cawing!'—it drives me mad.”</p>
                  <p>“I suppose foxes are pernicious beasts, also,” said 
Betty, as she walked on; “but there's an old red fox 
in the woods that I've been feeding for years. I don't 
know anything that foxes like to eat except chickens, 
but I carry him a basket of potatoes and turnips and 
bread, and pile them up under a pine tree;  it's just as 
well for him to acquire the taste for them, isn't it?”</p>
                  <pb n="126"/>
                  <p>She smiled at Dan above her fur tippet, and he 
forgot her words in watching the animation come 
and go in her face. He fell to musing over her 
decisive little chin, the sensitive curves of her 
nostrils and sweet wide mouth, and above all over 
her kind yet ardent look, which gave the peculiar 
beauty to her eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, is there anything in heaven or earth that you 
don't like?”  he asked, as he gazed at her.</p>
                  <p>“That I don't like? Shall I really tell you?”</p>
                  <p>He bent toward her over his armful of holly.</p>
                  <p>“I have a capacious breast for secrets,” he 
assured her.</p>
                  <p>“Then you will never breathe it?” </p>
                  <p>“Will you have me swear?” he glanced about him.</p>
                  <p>“Not by the inconstant moon,” she entreated 
merrily.</p>
                  <p>“Well, by my ‘gracious self’; what's the rest of it?”</p>
                  <p>She coloured and drew away from him. His eyes 
made her self-conscious, ill at ease; the very 
carelessness of his look disconcerted her.</p>
                  <p>“No, do not swear,” she begged. “I shall trust 
you with even so weighty a confidence. I do not 
like—”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, come, why torture me?”  he demanded.</p>
                  <p>She made a little gesture of alarm. “From fear of 
the wrath to come,” she admitted.</p>
                  <p>“Of my wrath?” he regarded her with amazement. 
“Oh, don't you like <hi rend="italics">me</hi>?” he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“You! Yes, yes—but—have mercy upon your 
petitioner. I do not like your cravats.”</p>
                  <pb n="127"/>
                  <p>She shut her eyes and stood before him with 
lowered head.</p>
                  <p>“My cravats!”  cried Dan, in dismay, as his hand went 
to his throat, “but my cravats are from Paris—Charlie 
Morson brought them over. What is the matter with 
them?”</p>
                  <p>“They—they're too fancy,” confessed Betty. “Papa 
wears only white, or black ones you know.”</p>
                  <p>“Too fancy! Nonsense! do you want to send me back 
to grandfather's stocks, I wonder? It's just pure 
envy—that's what it is. Never mind, I'll give you the 
very best one I've got.”</p>
                  <p>Betty shook her head. “And what should I do with it, 
pray?” she asked. “Uncle Shadrach wouldn't wear it 
for worlds—he wears only papa's clothes, you see. Oh, I 
might give it to Hosea; but I don't think he'd like it.”</p>
                  <p>“Hosea! Well, I declare,” exclaimed Dan, and was 
silent.</p>
                  <p>When he spoke a little later it was somewhat 
awkwardly.</p>
                  <p>“I say, did Virginia ever tell you she didn't like my 
cravats?” he inquired. </p>
                  <p>“Virginia!”  her voice was a little startled. “Oh, 
Virginia thinks they're lovely.”</p>
                  <p>“And you don't?”</p>
                  <p>“No, I don't.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you are a case,” he said, and walked on
slowly.</p>
                  <p>They were already in sight of the house, and he 
did not speak again until they had passed the portico 
and entered the hall. There they found Virginia and 
the young men, who had ridden over ahead of
<pb n="128"/>
them, hanging evergreens for the approaching party. 
Jack Morson, from the top of the step-ladder, was 
suspending a holly wreath above the door, while 
Champe was entwining the mahogany balustrade in 
running cedar.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Betty, would it be disrespectful to put 
mistletoe above General Washington's portrait?” 
called Virginia, as they went into the hall.</p>
                  <p>“I don't think he'd mind—the old dear,” answered 
Betty, throwing her armful of holly upon the floor.    
“There, Dan, the burden of the day is over.”</p>
                  <p>“And none too soon,” said Dan, as he tossed the 
holly from him. “Diggs, you sluggard, what are you 
sitting there in idleness for? Miss Pussy, can't you 
set him to work?”</p>
                  <p>Miss Pussy, who was bustling in and out with a 
troop of servants at her heels, found time to reply 
seriously that she really didn't think there was 
anything she could trust him with. “Of course, I 
don't mind your amusing yourselves with the 
decorations,” she added briskly, “but the cooking is 
quite a different thing, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“Amusing myself!”  protested Dan, in 
astonishment. “My dear lady, do you call carrying a 
wagon load of brushwood amusement? Now, I'll 
grant, if you please, that Morson is amusing himself 
on the step-ladder.”</p>
                  <p>“Keep off,” implored Morson, in terror; “if you 
shake the thing, I'm gone, I declare I am.”</p>
                  <p>He nailed the garland in place and came down 
cautiously. “Now, that's what I call an artistic job,” 
he complacently remarked.</p>
                  <pb n="129"/>
                  <p>“Why, it's lovely,” said Virginia, smiling, as he 
fumed to her. “It's lovely, isn't it, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>“As lovely as a crooked thing can be,” laughed 
Betty. She was looking earnestly at Virginia, and 
wondering if she really liked Jack Morson so very 
much. The girl was so bewitching in her reel dress, 
with the flush of a sudden emotion in her face, and 
the shyness in her downcast eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Oh? that isn't fair, Virginia,” called Champe 
from the steps. “Save your favour for the man that 
deserves it—and look at me.” Virginia did look at 
him, sending him the same radiant glance.</p>
                  <p>“But I've many ‘lovelies’ left,” she said quickly;    
“it's my favourite word.”</p>
                  <p>“A most appropriate taste,” faltered Diggs, from 
his chair beneath the hall clock.</p>
                  <p>Champe descended the staircase with a bound.</p>
                  <p>“What do I hear?” he exclaimed. “Has the 
oyster opened his mouth and brought forth a 
compliment?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, be quiet,” commanded Dan, “I shan't hear 
Diggs made fun of, and it's time to get back, 
anyway. Well, loveliest of lovely ladies, you must 
put on your prettiest frock to-night.”</p>
                  <p>Virginia's blush deepened. Did she like Dan so 
very much? thought Betty.</p>
                  <p>“But you mustn't notice me, please,” she begged, 
“all the neighbours are coming, and there are so 
many girls,—the Powells and the Harrisons and the 
Dulaneys. I am going to wear pink, but you mustn't 
notice it, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“That's right,” said Jack Morson, “make him
<pb n="130"/>
do his duty by the County, and keep your dances for 
Diggs and me.” </p>
                  <p>“I've done my duty by you, sir,” was Dan's prompt 
retort, “so I'll begin to do my pleasure by myself. 
Now I give you fair warning, Virginia, if you don't 
save the first reel for me, I'll dance all the rest with 
Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“Then it will be a Betty of your own making,” 
declared Betty over her shoulder, “for this Betty 
doesn't dance a single step with you to-night, so 
there, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“Your punishment be on your own head, rash 
woman,” said Dan, sternly, as he took up his 
riding-whip. “I'll dance with Peggy Harrison,” 
and he went out to Prince Rupert, lifting his hat, 
as he mounted, to Miss Lydia, who stood at her 
window above. A moment later they heard his horse's 
hoofs ringing in the drive, and his voice gayly 
whistling:—</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“They tell me thou'rt the favor'd guest.”</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>When the others joined him in the turnpike, the 
four voices took up the air, and sent the pathetic 
melody fairly dancing across the snow.</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Do I thus haste to hall and bower</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>The song ended in a burst of laughter, and up the 
white turnpike, beneath the melting snow that
<pb n="131"/>
rained down from the trees, they rode merrily back 
to Chericoke.</p>
                  <p>In the carriage way they found the Major, wrapped 
in his broadcloth cape, taking what he called a  
“breath of air.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, gentlemen, I hope you had a pleasant ride,” 
he remarked, following them into the house. 
“You didn't see your way to stop by Uplands, I 
reckon?”</p>
                  <p>“That we did, sir,” said Diggs, who was never 
bashful with the Major. “In fact, we made ourselves 
rather useful, I believe.”</p>
                  <p>“They're charming young ladies over there, eh?” 
inquired the Major, genially; and a little later when 
Dan and he were alone, he put the same question to 
his grandson. “They're delightful girls, are they not, 
my boy?” he ventured incautiously.  “You have 
noticed, I dare say, how your grandmother takes to 
Betty—and she's not a woman of many fancies, is 
your grandmother.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, but Virginia!”  exclaimed Dan, with 
enthusiasm. “I wish you could have seen her in her 
red dress to-day. You don't half realize what a 
thundering beauty that girl is. Why, she positively 
took my breath away.”</p>
                  <p>The Major chuckled and rubbed his hands 
together.</p>
                  <p>“I don't, eh?” he said, scenting a romance as an 
old war horse scents a battle. “Well, well, maybe 
not; but I see where the wind blows anyway, and 
you have my congratulations on either hand. I 
shan't deny that we old folks had a leaning to
<pb n="132"/>
Betty; but youth is youth, and we shan't oppose your 
fancy. So I congratulate you, my boy, I congratulate 
you.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, she wouldn't look at me, sir,” declared Dan, 
feeling that the pace was becoming a little too 
impetuous. “I only wish she would; but I'd as soon 
expect the moon to drop from the skies.”</p>
                  <p>“Not look at you! Pooh, pooh!” protested the old 
gentleman, indignantly.“Proper pride is not vanity, 
sir; and there's never been a Lightfoot yet that 
couldn't catch a woman's eye, if I do say it who 
should not. Pooh, pooh! it isn't a faint heart that wins 
the ladies.”</p>
                  <p>“I know you to be an authority, my dear 
grandpa,” admitted the young man, lightly glancing 
into the gilt-framed mirror above the mantel. “If 
there's any of your blood in me, it makes for 
conquest.” From the glass he caught the laughter in 
his eyes and turned it on his grandfather.</p>
                  <p>“It ill becomes me to rob the Lightfoots of one of 
their chief distinctions,” said the Major, smiling in 
his turn.“We are not a proud people, my boy; but 
we've always fought like men and made love like 
gentlemen, and I hope that you will live up to your 
inheritance.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as his grandson ran upstairs to dress, he 
followed him as far as Mrs. Lightfoot's chamber, 
and informed her with a touch of pomposity:“That 
it was Virginia, not Betty, after all. But we'll make 
the best of it, my dear,” he added cheerfully.“Either 
of the Ambler girls is a jewel of priceless value.”</p>
                  <pb n="133"/>
                  <p>The little old lady received this flower of speech 
with more than ordinary unconcern.</p>
                  <p>“Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Lightfoot, that the 
boy has begun already?” she demanded, in 
amazement.</p>
                  <p>“He doesn't say so,” replied the Major, with a 
chuckle; “but I see what he means—I see what he 
means. Why, he told me he wished I could have 
seen her to-day in her red dress—and, bless my 
soul, I wish I could, ma'am.”</p>
                  <p>“I don't see what good it would do you,” returned 
his wife, coolly. “But did he have the face to tell 
you he was in love with the girl, Mr. Lightfoot?”</p>
                  <p>“Have the face?” repeated the Major, testily.     
“Pray, why shouldn't he have the face, ma'am? 
Whom should he tell, I'd like to know, before he 
tells his grandfather?” and with a final “pooh, 
pooh!” he returned angrily to his library and to the 
<hi rend="italics">Richmond Whig</hi>, a paper he breathlessly read and 
mightily abused.</p>
                  <p>Dan, meanwhile, upstairs in his room with 
Champe, was busily sorting his collection of 
neck-wear.</p>
                  <p>“Look here, Champe, I'll give you all these red 
ties, if you want them,” he generously concluded. “I 
believe, after all, I'll take to wearing white or black 
ones again.”</p>
                  <p>“What?” asked Champe, in astonishment, 
turning on his heel. “Have the skies fallen, or does 
Beau Montjoy forsake the fashions?”</p>
                  <p>“Confound the fashions!” retorted Dan, 
impatiently. “I don't care a jot for the fashions. You	
<pb n="134"/>
may have all these, if you choose,” and he tossed the 
neckties upon the bed.</p>
                  <p>Champe picked up one and examined it with 
interest.</p>
                  <p>“O woman,” he murmured as he did so, “your hand 
is small but mighty.”</p>

                  <head>LOVE IN A MAZE</head>
                  <p>DESPITE Virginia's endeavour to efface herself for her 
guests, she shone unrivalled at the party, and Dan, who 
had held her hand for an ecstatic moment under the 
mistletoe, felt, as he rode home in the moonlight 
afterwards, that his head was fairly on fire with her 
beauty. She had been sweetly candid and flatteringly 
impartial. He could not honestly assert that she had 
danced with him oftener than with Morson, or a dozen 
others, but he had a pleasant feeling that even when she 
shook her head and said, “I cannot,” her soft eyes 
added for her, “though I really wish to.” There was 
something almost pitiable, he told himself in the 
complacency with which that self-satisfied ass Morson 
would come and take her from him. As if he hadn't 
sense enough to discover that it was merely because she 
was his hostess that she went with him at all. But some 
men would never understand women, though they lived 
to be a thousand, and got rejected once a day.</p>
                  <p>Out in the moonlight, with the Governor's wine 
singing in his blood, he found that his emotions had a 
way of tripping lightly off his tongue. There were hot 
words with Diggs, who hinted that Virginia was not the 
beauty of the century. and threats of blows
<pb n="136"/>
with Morson, who too boldly affirmed that she was. 
In the end Champe rode between them, and sent 
Prince Rupert on his way with a touch of the whip.</p>
                  <p>“For heaven's sake, keep your twaddle to 
yourselves!” he exclaimed impatiently, “or take my 
advice, and make for the nearest duck pond. You've 
both gone over your depth in the Governor's 
Madeira, and I advise you to keep quiet until you've 
had your heads in a basin of ice water. There, get out 
of my road, Morson. I can't sit here freezing all 
night.”</p>
                  <p>“Do you dare to imply that I am drunk, sir?” 
demanded Morson, in a fury. “Bear witness, 
gentlemen, that the insult was unprovoked.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, insult be damned!” retorted Champe. “If 
you shake your fist at me again, I'll pitch you head 
over heels into that snowdrift.”</p>
                  <p>“Pitch whom, sir?” roared Morson, riding at the 
wall, when Diggs caught his bridle and roughly 
dragged him back.</p>
                  <p>“Come, now, don't make a beast of yourself,” he 
implored.</p>
                  <p>“Who's a beast?” was promptly put by Morson; 
but leaving it unanswered, Diggs wheeled his horse 
about and started up the turnpike. “You've let Beau 
get out of sight,” he said. “We'd better catch up with 
him,” and he set off at a gallop.</p>
                  <p>Dan, who had ridden on at Champe's first words, 
did not even turn his head when the three tame 
abreast with him. The moonlight was in his eyes, 
and the vision of Virginia floated before him at his 
saddle bow. He let the reins fall loosely on Prince 
Rupert's neck, and as the hoofs rang on the frozen
<pb n="137"/>
road, thrust his hands for warmth into his coat. In 
another dress, with his dark hair blown backward in 
the wind, he might have been a cavalier fresh from 
the service of his lady or his king, or riding 
carelessly to his death for the sake of the drunken 
young Pretender.</p>
                  <p>But he was only following his dreams, and they 
hovered round Virginia, catching their rosy glamour 
from her dress. In the cold night air he saw her 
walking demurely through the lancers, her skirt held 
up above her satin shoes, her coral necklace glowing 
deeper pink against her slim white throat. Mistletoe 
and holly hung over her, and the light of the candles 
shone brighter where her radiant figure passed. He 
caught the soft flash of her shy brown eyes, he 
heard her gentle voice speaking trivial things with 
profound tenderness. His hand still burned from the 
light pressure of her finger tips. Oh, his day had 
come, he told himself, and he was furiously in love 
at last.</p>
                  <p>As for going back to college, the very idea was 
absurd. At twenty years it was quite time for him to 
settle down and keep open house like other men. 
Virginia, in rose pink, flitted up the crooked stair 
and across the white panels of the parlor, and with a 
leap, his heart went after her. He saw Great-aunt 
Emmeline lean down from her faded canvas as if to 
toss her apple at the young girl's feet. Ah, poor old 
beauty, hanging in a gilded frame, what was her 
century of dust to a bit of living flesh that had bright 
eyes and was coloured like a flower?</p>
                  <p>When he was safely married he would have his 
wife's portrait hung upon the opposite wall, only he
<pb n="138"/>
rather thought he should have the dogs in and let her 
be Diana, with a spear instead of an apple in her 
hand. Two beauties in one family—that was 
something to be proud of even in Virginia.</p>
                  <p>It was at this romantic point that Champe 
shattered his visions by shooting a jest at him about 
the “love sick swain.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, be off, and let a fellow think, won't you?” 
he retorted angrily.</p>
                  <p>“Do you hear him call it thinking?” jeered 
Diggs, from the other side.</p>
                  <p>“He doesn't call it mooning, oh, no,” scoffed 
Champe.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life,” sang 
Morson, striking an attitude that almost threw him 
off his horse.</p>
                  <p>“Shut up, Morson,” commanded Diggs, “you 
ought to be thankful if you had enough sense left to 
moon with.”</p>
                  <p>“Sense, who wants sense?” inquired Morson, on 
the point of tears: “I have heart, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“Then keep it bottled up,” rejoined Champe, 
coolly, as they turned into the drive at Chericoke.</p>
                  <p>In Dan's room they found Big Abel stretched 
before the fire asleep; and as the young men came 
in, he sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Hi! young Marsters, hit's ter-morrow!” he 
exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“To-morrow! I wish it were to-morrow,” 
responded Dan, cheerfully. “The fire makes my 
head spin like a top. Here, come and pull off my 
coat, Big Abel, or I'll have to go to bed with my 
clothes on.”</p>
                  <pb n="139"/>
                  <p>Big Abel pulled off the coat and brushed it carefully; 
then he held out his hand for Champe's.</p>
                  <p>“I hope dis yer coat ain' gwine lose hit's set 'fo' hit 
gits ter me,” he muttered as he hung them up. “Seems 
like you don' teck no cyar yo' clothes, no-how, Marse 
Dan. I'se de wuss dress somebody dis yer side er de po' 
w'ite trash. Wat's de use er bein' de quality ef'n you ain' 
got de close?”</p>
                  <p>“Stop grumbling, you fool you,” returned Dan, with 
his lordly air. “If it's my second best evening suit you're 
after, you may take it; but I tell you now, it's the last 
thing you're going to get out of me till summer.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel took down the second best suit of clothes 
and examined them with an interest they had never 
inspired before. “I d'clar you sutney does set hard,” he 
remarked after a moment, and added, tentatively, “I 
dunno whar de shuts gwine come f'om.”</p>
                  <p>“Not from me,” replied Dan, airily; “and now get 
out of here, for I'm going to sleep.”</p>
                  <p>But when he threw himself upon his bed it was to toss 
with feverish rose-coloured dreams until the daybreak.</p>
                  <p>His blood was still warm when he came down to 
breakfast; but he met his grandfather's genial jests with 
a boyish attempt at counter-buff.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you needn't twit me, sir,” he said with an 
embarrassed laugh; “to wear the heart upon the sleeve is 
hereditary with us, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“Keep clear of the daws, my son, and it does no 
harm,” responded the Major. “There's nothing so 
becoming to a gentleman as a fine heart well worn, eh, 
Molly?”</p>
                  <pb n="140"/>
                  <p>He carefully spread the butter upon his cakes, for 
his day of love-making was over, and his eye could 
hold its twinkle while he watched Dan fidget in his 
seat.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot promptly took up the challenge. 
“For my part I prefer one under a buttoned coat,” she 
replied briskly; “but be careful, Mr. Lightfoot, or 
you will put notions into the boys' heads. They are at 
the age when a man has a fancy a day and gets over 
it before he knows it.”</p>
                  <p>“They are at the age when I had my fancy for 
you, Molly,” gallantly retorted the Major, “and I 
seem to be carrying it with me to my grave.”</p>
                  <p>“It would be a dull wit that would go roving from 
Aunt Molly,” said Champe, affectionately; “but 
there aren't many of her kind in the world.”</p>
                  <p>“I never found but one like her,” admitted the 
Major, “and I've seen a good deal in my day, sir.”</p>
                  <p>The old lady listened with a smile, though she 
spoke in a severe voice. “You mustn't let them teach 
you how to flatter, Mr. Morson,” she said warningly, 
as she filled the Major's second cup of coffee—       
“Cupid, Mr. Morson will have a partridge.”</p>
                  <p>“The man who sits at your table will never 
question your supremacy, dear madam,” returned 
Jack Morson, as he helped himself to a bird. “There 
is little merit in devotion to such bounty.”</p>
                  <p>“Shall I kick him, grandma?” demanded Dan. 
“He means that we love you because you feed us, 
the sly scamp.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot shook her head reprovingly. “Oh, 
I understand you, Mr. Morson,” she said
<pb n="141"/>
amiably, “and a compliment to my housekeeping never 
goes amiss. If a woman has any talent, it will come out 
upon her table.”</p>
                  <p>“You're right, Molly, you're right,” agreed the Major, 
heartily. “I've always held that there was nothing in a 
man who couldn't make a speech or in a woman who 
couldn't set a table.”</p>
                  <p>Dan stirred restlessly in his chair, and at the first 
movement of Mrs. Lightfoot he rose and went out into 
the hall. An hour later he ordered Prince Rupert and 
started joyously to Uplands.</p>
                  <p>As he rode through the frosted air he pictured to 
himself a dozen different ways in which it was possible 
that he might meet Virginia. Would she be upon the 
portico or in the parlour? Was she still in pink or would 
she wear the red gown of yesterday? When she gave 
him her hand would she smile as she had smiled last 
night? or would she stand demurely grave with down 
dropped lashes?</p>
                  <p>The truth was that she did none of the 
things he had half expected of her. She was sitting 
before a log fire, surrounded by a group of Harrisons 
and Powells, who had been prevailed upon to spend 
the night, and when he entered she gave him a sleepy 
little nod from the corner of a rosewood sofa. As she 
lay back in the firelight she was like a drowsy kitten 
that had just awakened from a nap. Though less 
radiant, her beauty was more appealing, and as she 
stared at him with her large eyes blinking, he wanted 
to stoop down and rock her off to sleep. He regarded 
her calmly this morning, for, with all his tenderness, 
she did not fire his brain, and the glory of the 
vision had passed away. Half angrily he
<pb n="142"/>
asked himself if he were in love with a pink dress 
and nothing more?</p>
                  <p>An hour afterward he came noisily into the library 
at Chericoke and aroused the Major from his Horace 
by stamping distractedly about the room.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it's all up with me, sir,” he began 
despondently. “I might as well go out and hang 
myself. I don't know what I want and yet I'm going 
mad because I can't get it.”</p>
                  <p>“Come, come,” said the Major, soothingly. “I've 
been through it myself, sir, and since your 
grandmother's out of earshot, I'd as well confess that 
I've been through it more than once. Cheer up, cheer 
up, you aren't the first to dare the venture—<foreign xml:lang="lat">Vixere 
fortes ante Agamemnona</foreign>, you know.”</p>
                  <p>His assurance was hardly as comforting as he had 
intended it to be. “Oh, I dare say, there've been 
fools enough before me,” returned Dan, impatiently, 
as he flung himself out of the room.</p>
                  <p>He grew still more impatient when the day came 
for him to return to college; and as they started out 
on horseback, with Zeke and Big Abel riding behind 
their masters, he declared irritably that the whole 
system of education was a nuisance, and that he 
“wished the ark had gone down with all the ancient 
languages on board.”</p>
                  <p>“There would still be law,” suggested Morson, 
pleasantly. “So cheer up, Beau, there's something 
left for you to learn.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as they passed Uplands, they turned, with a 
single impulse, and cantered up the broad drive to 
the portico. Betty and Virginia were in the library;
<pb n="143"/>
and as they heard the horses, they came running to 
the window and threw it open.</p>
                  <p>“So you will come back in the summer—all of 
you,” said Virginia, hopefully, and as she leaned out 
a white camellia fell from her bosom to the snow 
beneath. In an instant Jack Morson was off his 
horse and the flower was in his hand. “We'll bring 
back all that we take away,” he answered gallantly, 
his fair boyish face as red as Virginia's.</p>
                  <p>Dan could have kicked him for the words, but he 
merely said savagely, “Have you left your pocket 
handkerchief?” and turned Prince Rupert toward 
the road. When he looked back from beneath the 
silver poplars, the girls were still standing at the 
open window, the cold wind flushing their cheeks 
and blowing the brown hair and the red together.</p>
                  <p>Virginia was the first to turn away. “Come in, 
you'll take cold,” she said, going to the fire. “Peggy 
Harrison never goes out when the wind blows, you 
know, she says it's dreadful for the complexion. 
Once when she had to come back from town on a 
March day, she told me she wore six green veils. I 
wonder if that's the way she keeps her lovely 
colour?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I wouldn't be Peggy Harrison,” returned 
Betty, gayly, and she added in the same tone, “so 
Mr. Morson got your camellia, after all, didn't he?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, he begged so hard with his eyes,” answered 
Virginia. “He had seen me give Dan a white rose on 
Christmas Eve, you know, and he said it wasn't fair 
to be so unfair.”</p>
                  <p>“You gave Dan a white rose?” repeated Betty,
<pb n="144"/>
slowly. Her face was pale; but she was smiling 
brightly.</p>
                  <p>Virginia's soft little laugh pealed out. “And it was 
your rose, too, darling,” she said, nestling to Betty 
like a child. “You dropped it on the stair and I 
picked it up. I was just going to take it to you 
because it looked so lovely in your hair, when Dan 
came along and he would have it, whether or no. But 
you don't mind, do you, just a little bit of white 
rosebud?” She put up her hand and stroked her 
sister's cheek. “Men are so silly, aren't they?” she 
added with a sigh.</p>
                  <p>For a moment Betty looked down upon the brown 
head on her bosom; then she stooped and kissed 
Virginia's brow. “Oh, no, I don't mind, dear,” she 
answered, “and women are very silly, too, 
sometimes.”</p>
                  <p>She loosened Virginia's arms and went slowly 
upstairs to her bedroom, where Petunia was 
replenishing the fire. “You may go down, Petunia,” 
she said as she entered. “I am going to put my 
things to rights, and I don't want you to bother 
me—go straight downstairs.”</p>
                  <p>“Is you gwine in yo' chist er draws?” inquired 
Petunia, pausing upon the threshold.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, I'm going into my chest of drawers, but 
you're not,” retorted Betty, sharply; and when 
Petunia had gone out and closed the door after her, 
she pulled out her things and began to straighten 
rapidly, rolling up her ribbons with shaking fingers, 
and carefully folding her clothes into compact 
squares. Ever since her childhood she had always 
begun to work at her chest of drawers when any
<pb n="145"/>
sudden shock unnerved her. After a great happiness she 
took up her trowel and dug among the flowers of the 
garden; but when her heart was heavy within her, she 
shut her door and put her clothes to rights.</p>
                  <p>Now, as she worked rapidly, the tears welled 
slowly to her lashes, but she brushed them angrily 
away, and rolled up a sky-blue sash. She had worn 
the sash at Chericoke on Christmas Eve, and as she 
looked at it, she felt, with the keenness of pain, 
a thrill of her old girlish happiness. The figure of 
Dan, as he stood upon the threshold with the powdering 
of snow upon his hair, rose suddenly to her eyes, 
and she flinched before the careless humour of his 
smile. It was her own fault, she told herself a little 
bitterly, and because it was her own fault she could bear 
it as she should have borne the joy. There was nothing 
to cry over, nothing even to regret; she knew now that she 
loved him, and she was glad—glad even of this. If the 
bitterness in her heart was but the taste of knowledge, 
she would not let it go; she would keep both the knowledge 
and the bitterness.</p>
                  <p>In the next room Mammy Riah was rocking back and 
forth upon the hearth, crooning to herself while she 
carded a lapful of wool. Her cracked old voice, still 
with its plaintive sweetness, came faintly to the girl 
who leaned her cheek upon the sky-blue sash and 
listened, half against her will:—</p>

                  <p>The door opened and Virginia came softly into the 
room, and stopped short at the sight of Betty.</p>
                  <p>“Why, your things were perfectly straight, 
Betty,” she exclaimed in surprise. “I declare, you'll 
be a real old maid.”</p>
                  <p>“Perhaps I shall,” replied Betty, indifferently; 
“but if I am, I'm going to be a tidy one.”</p>
                  <p>“I never heard of one who wasn't,” remarked 
Virginia, and added, “you've put all your ribbons 
into the wrong drawer.”</p>
                  <p>“I like a change,” said Betty, folding up a muslin 
skirt.</p>

                  </lg>
                  <p>sang Mammy Riah, in the adjoining room.</p>
                  <p>“Aunt Lydia found six red pinks in bloom in her 
window garden,” observed Virginia, cheerfully.        
“Why, where are you going, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>“Just for a walk,” answered Betty, as she put on 
her bonnet and cloak. “I'm not afraid of the cold, 
you know, and I'm so tired sitting still,” and she 
added, as she fastened her fur tippet, “I shan't be 
long, dear.”</p>
                  <p>She opened the door, and Mammy Riah's voice 
followed her across the hall and down the broad 
staircase:—</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Oh, we'll ride on de milk w'ite ponies, by en bye, little chillun, </l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>At the foot of the stair she called the dogs, and 
they came bounding through the hall and leaped
<pb n="147"/>
upon her as she crossed the portico. Then, as she 
went down the drive and up the desolate turnpike, 
they ran ahead of her with short, joyous barks.</p>
                  <p>The snow had melted and frozen again, and the 
long road was like a gray river winding between 
leafless trees. The gaunt crows were still flying 
back and forth over the meadows, but she did not 
have corn for them to-day. Had she been happy, she 
would not have forgotten them; but the pain in her 
breast made her selfish even about the crows.</p>
                  <p>With the dogs leaping round her, she pressed 
bravely against the wind, flying breathlessly from 
the struggle at her heart. There was nothing to cry 
over, she told herself again, nothing even to regret. 
It was her own fault, and because it was her own 
fault she could bear it quietly as she should have 
borne the joy.</p>
                  <p>She had reached the spot where he had lifted her 
upon the wall, and leaning against the rough stones 
she looked southward to where the swelling 
meadows dipped into the projecting line of hills. He 
was before her then, as he always would be, and 
shrinking back, she put up her hand to shut out the 
memory of his eyes. She could have hated that 
shallow gayety, she told herself, but for the 
tenderness that lay beneath it—since jest as he 
might at his own scars, when had he ever made 
mirth of another's? Had she not seen him fight the 
battles of free Levi? and when Aunt Rhody's cabin 
was in flames did he not bring out one of the negro 
babies in his coat? That dare-devil courage which 
had first caught her girlish fancy, thrilled her even 
to-day as the proof of an ennobling purpose. She
<pb n="148"/>
remembered that he had gone whistling into the 
burning cabin, and coming out again had coolly 
taken up the broken air; and to her this inherent 
recklessness was clothed with the sublimity of her 
own ideals.</p>
                  <p>The cold wind had stiffened her limbs, and she ran 
back into the road and walked on rapidly. Beyond 
the whitened foldings of the mountains a deep red 
glow was burning in the west, and she wanted to 
hold out her hands to it for warmth. Her next 
thought was that a winter sunset soon died out, and 
as she turned quickly to go homeward, she saw that 
she was before Aunt Ailsey's cabin, and that the 
little window was yellow from the light within.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Ailsey had been dead for years, but the free 
negro Levi had moved into her hut, and as Betty 
looked up she saw him standing beneath the blasted 
oak, with a bundle of brushwood upon his shoulder. 
He was an honest-eyed, grizzled-haired old negro, 
who wrung his meagre living from a blacksmith's 
trade, bearing alike the scornful pity of his white 
neighbours and the withering contempt of his black 
ones. For twenty years he had moved from spot to 
spot along the turnpike, and he had lived in the 
dignity of loneliness since the day upon which his 
master had won for himself the freedom of Eternity, 
leaving to his servant Levi the labour of his own 
hands.</p>
                  <p>As the girl spoke to him he answered timidly, 
fingering the edge of his ragged coat.</p>
                  <p>Yes, he had managed to keep warm through the 
winter, and he had worn the red flannel that she had 
given him.</p>
                  <pb n="149"/>
                  <p>“And your rheumatism?” asked Betty, kindly.</p>
                  <p>He replied that it had been growing worse of late, 
and with a sympathetic word the girl was passing by 
when some newer pathos in his solitary figure 
stayed her feet, and she called back quickly, “Uncle 
Levi, were you ever married?”</p>
                  <p>“Dar, now,” cried Uncle Levi, halting in the path 
while a gleam of the wistful humour of his race 
leaped to his eyes. “Dar, now, is you ever hyern de 
likes er dat? Mah'ed! Cose I'se mah'ed. I'se mah'ed 
quick'en Marse Bolling. Ain't you never hyern tell er 
Sarindy?”</p>
                  <p>“Sarindy?” repeated the girl, questioningly.</p>
                  <p>“Lawd, Lawd, Sarindy wuz a moughty likely 
nigger,” said Uncle Levi, proudly; “she warn' 
nuttin' but a fiel' han', but she 'uz a moughty likely 
nigger.”</p>
                  <p>“And did she die?” asked Betty, in a whisper.</p>
                  <p>Uncle Levi rubbed his hands together, and shifted 
the brushwood upon his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>“Who say Sarindy dead?” he demanded sternly, 
and added with a chuckle, “she warn' nuttin' but a 
fiel'  han', young miss, en I 'uz Marse Bolling's body 
sarvent, so w'en dey sot me loose, dey des sol' 
Sarindy up de river. Lawd, Lawd, she warn' nuttin' 
but a fiel' han', but she 'uz pow'ful likely.”</p>
                  <p>He went chuckling up the path, and Betty, with a 
glance at the fading sunset, started briskly 
homeward. As she walked she was asking herself, in 
a wonder greater than her own love or grief, if Uncle 
Levi really thought it funny that they sold Sarindy 
up the river.</p>

                  <head>THE MAJOR LOSES HIS TEMPER</head>
                  <p>WHEN Betty reached home the dark had fallen, and 
as she entered the house she heard the crackling of 
fresh logs from the library, and saw her mother 
sitting alone in the firelight, which flickered softly on 
her pearl-gray silk and ruffles of delicate lace.</p>
                  <p>She was humming in a low voice one of the old 
Scotch ballads the Governor loved, and as she 
rocked gently in her rosewood chair, her shadow 
flitted to and fro upon the floor. One loose bell 
sleeve hung over the carved arm of the rocker, and 
the fingers of her long white hand, so fragile that it 
was like a flower, played silently upon the polished 
wood.</p>
                  <p>As the girl entered she looked up quickly. “You 
haven't been wandering off by yourself again?” she 
asked reproachfully.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it is quite safe, mamma,” replied Betty, 
impatiently. “I didn't meet a soul except free Levi.”</p>
                  <p>“Your father wouldn't like it, my dear,” returned 
Mrs. Ambler, in the tone in which she might have 
said, “it is forbidden in the Scriptures,” and she 
added after a moment, “but where is Petunia? You 
might, at least, take Petunia with you.”</p>
                  <p>“Petunia is such a chatterbox,” said Betty, 
tossing her wraps upon a chair, “and if she sees a
<pb n="151"/>
cricket in the road she shrieks, ‘Gawd er live, Miss 
Betty,’ and jumps on the other side of me. No, I 
can't stand Petunia.”</p>
                  <p>She sat down upon an ottoman at her mother's 
feet, and rested her chin in her clasped hands.</p>
                  <p>“But did you never go walking in your life, 
mamma?” she questioned.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler looked a little startled. “Never 
alone, my dear,” she replied with dignity. “Why, I 
shouldn't have thought of such a thing. There was a 
path to a little arbour in the glen at my old home, I 
remember,—I think it was at least a quarter of a 
mile away,—and I sometimes strolled there with 
your father: but there were a good many briers 
about, so I usually preferred to stay on the lawn.”</p>
                  <p>Her voice was clear and sweet, but it had none of 
the humour which gave piquancy to Betty's. It might 
soothe, caress, even reprimand, but it could never 
jest; for life to Mrs. Ambler was soft, yet serious, 
like a continued prayer to a pleasant and tender 
Deity.</p>
                  <p>“I'm sure I don't see how you stood it,” said 
Betty, sympathetically.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I rode, my dear,” returned her mother. “I used 
to ride very often with your father or—or one of the 
others. I had a brown mare named Zephyr.”</p>
                  <p>“And you never wanted to be alone, never for a 
single instant?”</p>
                  <p>“Alone?” repeated Mrs. Ambler, wonderingly,  
“why, of course I read my Bible and meditated an 
hour every morning. In my youth it would have
<pb n="152"/>
been considered very unladylike not to do it, and I'm 
sure there's no better way of beginning the day than 
with a chapter in the Bible and a little meditation. I 
wish you would try it, Betty.”  Her eyes were upon 
her daughter, and she added in an unchanged voice,  
“Don't you think you might manage to make your 
hair lie smoother, dear? It's very pretty, I know; but 
the way it curls about your face is just a bit untidy, 
isn't it?”</p>
                  <p>Then, as the Governor came in from his day in 
town, she turned eagerly to hear the news of his 
latest speech.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I've had a great day, Julia,” began the 
Governor; but as he stooped to kiss her, she gave a 
little cry of alarm. “Why, you're frozen through!” 
she exclaimed. “Betty, stir the fire, and make your 
father sit down by the fender. Shall I mix you a 
toddy, Mr. Ambler?”</p>
                  <p>“Tut, tut!” protested the Governor, laughing, 
“a touch of the wind is good for the blood, my 
dear.”</p>
                  <p>There was a light track of snow where he had 
crossed the room, and as he rested his foot upon the 
brass knob of the fender, the ice clinging to his 
riding-boot melted and ran down upon the hearth.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I've had a great day,” he repeated heartily, 
holding his plump white hands to the flames. “It 
was worth the trip to test the spirit of Virginia; 
and it's sound, Julia, as sound as steel. Why, when 
I said in my speech—you'll remember the place, my 
dear—that if it came to a choice between slavery 
and the Union, we'd ship the negroes back to Africa, 
and hold on to the flag, I was applauded 
<pb n="153"/>
to the echo, and it would have done you good to hear 
the cheers.”</p>
                  <p>“I knew it would be so, Mr. Ambler,” returned 
his wife, with conviction. “Even if they thought 
otherwise I was sure your speech would convince 
them. Dr. Crump was talking to me only yesterday, 
and he said that he had heard both Mr. Yancey and 
Mr. Douglas, and that neither of them—”</p>
                  <p>“I know, my love, I know,” interposed the 
Governor, waving his hand. “I have myself heard 
the good doctor commit the same error of judgment. 
But, remember, it is easy to convince a man who 
already thinks as you do; and since the Major has 
gone over to the Democrats, the doctor has grown 
Whiggish, you know.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler flushed. “I'm sure I don't see why 
you should deny that you have a talent for oratory,” 
she said gravely. “I have sometimes thought it was 
why I fell in love with you, you made such a 
beautiful speech the first day I met you at the 
tournament in Leicesterburg. Fred Dulany crowned 
me, you remember; and in your speech you brought 
in so many lovely things about flowers and women.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, Julia, Julia,” sighed the Governor, “so the 
sins of my youth are rising to confound me,” and he 
added quickly to Betty, “Isn't that some one coming 
up the drive, daughter?”</p>
                  <p>Betty ran to the window and drew back the 
damask curtains. “It's the Major, papa,” she said, 
nodding to the old gentleman through the glass, 
“and he does look so cold. Go out and bring him 
in, and don't—please don't talk horrid politics 
to-night.”</p>
                  <pb n="154"/>
                  <p>“I'll not, daughter, on my word, I'll not,” 
declared the Governor, and he wore the warning as a 
breastplate when he went out to meet his guest.</p>
                  <p>The Major, in his tight black broadcloth, 
entered, with his blandest smile, and bowed over Mrs. 
Ambler's hand.</p>
                  <p>“I saw your firelight as I was passing, dear 
madam,” he began, “and I couldn't go on without a 
glimpse of you, though I knew that Molly was 
waiting for me at the end of three cold miles.”</p>
                  <p>He put his arm about Betty and drew her to him.</p>
                  <p>“You must borrow some of your sister's blushes, 
my child,” he said; “it isn't right to grow pale at 
your age. I don't like to see it,” and then, as Virginia 
came shyly in, he held out his other hand, and 
accused her of stealing his boy's heart away from 
him. “But we old folks must give place to the 
young,” he continued cheerfully; “it's nature, and it's 
human nature, too.”</p>
                  <p>“It will be a dull day when you give place to any 
one else, Major,” returned the Governor, politely.</p>
                  <p>“And a far off one I trust,” added Mrs. Ambler, 
with her plaintive smile.</p>
                  <p>“Well, maybe so,” responded the Major, settling 
himself in an easy chair beside the fire. “Any way, 
you can't blame an old man for fighting for his 
own, as my friend Harry Smith put it when he lost 
his leg in the War of 1812.  ‘By God, it belongs to 
me,’ he roared to the surgeon, ‘and if it comes off, 
I'll take it off myself, sir.’ It took six men to hold 
him, and when it was over all he said was,
<pb n="155"/>
	
‘Well, gentlemen, you mustn't blame a man for 
fighting for his own.’ Ah, he was a sad scamp, was 
Harry, a sad scamp. He used to say that he didn't 
know whether he preferred a battle or a dinner, but 
he reckoned a battle was better for the blood. And to 
think that he died in his bed at last like any 
Christian.”</p>
                  <p>“That reminds me of Dick Wythe, who never 
needed any tonic but a fight,” returned the Governor, 
thoughtfully. “You remember Dick, don't you, 
Major?—a hard drinker, poor fellow, but handsome 
enough to have stepped out of Homer. I've been 
sitting by him at the post-office on a spring day, and 
seen him get up and slap a passerby on the face as 
coolly as he'd take his toddy. Of course the man 
would slap back again, and when it was over Dick 
would make his politest bow, and say pleasantly, 
‘Thank you, sir, I felt a touch of the gout.’ He told 
me once that if it was only a twinge, he chose a man 
of his own size; but if it was a positive wrench, he 
struck out at the biggest he could find.”</p>
                  <p>The Major leaned back, laughing. “That was 
Dick, sir, that was Dick!” he exclaimed, “and 
it was his father before him. Why, I've had my 
own blows with Taylor Wythe in his day, and never 
a hard word afterward, never a word.” Then his face 
clouded. “I saw Dick's brother Tom in town this 
morning,” he added. “A sneaking fellow, who hasn't 
the spirit in his whole body that was in his father's 
little finger. Why, what do you suppose he had the 
impudence to tell me, sir? Some one had asked him, 
he said, what he should do if Virginia
<pb n="156"/>
went to war, and he had answered that he'd stay at 
home and build an asylum for the fools that brought 
it on.” He turned his indignant face upon Mrs. 
Ambler, and she put in a modest word of sympathy.</p>
                  <p>“You mustn't judge Tom by his jests, sir,” 
rejoined the Governor, persuasively. “His wit takes 
with the town folks, you know, and I hear that he's 
becoming famous as a post-office orator.”</p>
                  <p>“There it is, sir, there it is,” retorted the Major.     
“I've always said that the post-offices were the ruin 
of this country—and that proves my words. Why, if 
there were no post-offices, there'd be fewer 
newspapers; and if there were fewer newspapers, 
there wouldn't be the <hi rend="italics">Richmond Whig</hi>.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor's glance wandered to his writing 
table.</p>
                  <p>“Then I should never see my views in print, 
Major,” he added, smiling; and a moment afterward, 
disregarding Mrs. Ambler's warning gestures, he 
plunged headlong into a discussion of political 
conditions.</p>
                  <p>As he talked the Major sat trembling in his chair, 
his stern face flushing from red to purple, and the 
heavy veins upon his forehead standing out like cords. 
“Vote for Douglas, sir!” he cried at last. “Vote for 
the biggest traitor that has gone scot free since 
Arnold! Why, I'd sooner go over to the arch-fiend 
himself and vote for Seward.”</p>
                  <p>“I'm not sure that you won't go farther and 
fare worse,” replied the Governor, gravely. “You 
know me for a loyal Whig, sir, but I tell you frankly, 
that I believe Douglas to be the man to save the
<pb n="157"/>
South. Cast him off, and you cast off your 
remaining hope.”</p>
                  <p>“Tush, tush!” retorted the Major, hotly. “I 
tell you I wouldn't vote to have Douglas President of 
Perdition, sir. Don't talk to me about your loyalty, 
Peyton Ambler, you're mad—you're all mad! I 
honestly believe that I am the only sane man in the 
state.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor had risen from his chair and was 
walking nervously about the room. His eyes were 
dim, and his face was pallid with emotion.</p>
                  <p>“My God, sir, don't you see where you are 
drifting?” he cried, stretching out an appealing hand 
to the angry old gentleman in the easy chair.</p>
                  <p>“Drifting! Pooh, pooh!” protested the Major, “at 
least I am not drifting into a nest of traitors, sir.”</p>
                  <p>And with his wrath hot within he rose to take 
his leave, very red and stormy, but retaining the 
presence of mind to assure Mrs. Ambler that the 
glimpse of her fireside would send him rejoicing 
upon his way.</p>
                  <p>Such burning topics went like strong wine to 
his head, and like strong wine left a craving which 
always carried him back to them in the end. He 
would quarrel with the Governor, and make his 
peace, and at the next meeting quarrel, without 
peace-making, again.</p>
                  <p>“Don't, oh, please don't talk horrid politics,
papa,” Betty would implore, when she saw the nose of his 
dapple mare turn into the drive between the silver 
poplars.</p>
                  <p>“I'll not, daughter, I give you my word I'll not,”
<pb n="158"/>
the Governor would answer, and for a time the 
conversation would jog easily along the well worn 
roads of county changes and by the green graves of 
many a long dead jovial neighbour. While the red 
logs spluttered on the hearth, they would sip their 
glasses of Madeira and amicably weigh the dust of   
“my friend Dick Wythe—a fine fellow, in spite of his 
little weakness.”</p>
                  <p>But in the end the live question would rear its 
head and come hissing from among the quiet graves; and 
Dick Wythe, who loved his fight, or Plaintain Dudley, 
in his ruffled shirt, would fall back suddenly to make 
way for the wrangling figures of the slaveholder and 
the abolitionist.</p>
                  <p>“I can't help it, Betty, I can't help it,” the 
Governor would declare, when he came back from following 
the old gentleman to the drive; “did you see Mr. 
Yancey step out of Dick Wythe's dry bones to-day? 
Poor Dick, an honest fellow who loved no man's 
quarrel but his own; it's too bad, I declare it's too 
bad.” And the next day he would send Betty over to 
Chericoke to stroke down the Major's temper.      
“Slippery are the paths of the peacemaker,” the girl 
laughed one morning, when she had ridden home 
after an hour of persuasion. “I go on tip-toe because 
of your indiscretions, papa. You really must learn to 
control yourself, the Major says.”</p>
                  <p>“Control myself!” repeated the Governor, 
laughing, though he looked a little vexed. “If I 
hadn't the control of a stoic, daughter, to say nothing 
of the patience of Job, do you think I'd be able to 
listen calmly to his tirades? Why, he wants to
<pb n="159"/>
pull the Government to pieces for his pleasure,” then 
he pinched her cheek and added, smiling, “Oh, you 
sly puss, why don't you play your pranks upon one 
of your own age?”</p>
                  <p>Through the long winter many visits were exchanged 
between Uplands and Chericoke, and once, on a mild 
February morning, Mrs. Lightfoot drove over in her 
old coach, with her knitting and her handmaid Mitty, 
to spend the day. She took Betty back with her, and 
the girl stayed a week in the queer old house, where 
the elm boughs tapped upon her window as she slept, 
and the shadows on the crooked staircase frightened 
her when she went up and down at night. It seemed 
to her that the presence of Jane Lightfoot still 
haunted the home that she had left. When the snow 
fell on the roof and the wind beat against the panes, 
she would open her door and look out into the long 
dim halls, as if she half expected to see a girlish 
figure in a muslin gown steal softly to the stair.</p>
                  <p>Dan was less with her in that stormy week than was 
the memory of his mother; even Great-aunt Emmeline, 
whose motto was written on the ivied glass, grew faint 
beside the outcast daughter of whom but one pale 
miniature remained. Before Betty went back to Uplands 
she had grown to know  Jane Lightfoot as she knew 
herself.</p>
                  <p>When the spring came she took up her trowel and 
followed Aunt Lydia into the garden. On bright 
mornings the two would work side by side among 
the flowers, kneeling in a row with the small darkies 
who came to their assistance. Peter, the gardener, 
would watch them lazily, as he leaned
<pb n="160"/>
upon his hoe, and mutter beneath his breath, “Dat 
dut wuz dut, en de dut er de flow'r baids warn' no 
better'n de dut er de co'n fiel'.”</p>
                  <p>Betty would laugh and shake her head as she 
planted her square of pansies. She was working 
feverishly to overcome her longing for the sight of 
Dan, and her growing dread of his return.</p>
                  <p>But at last on a sunny morning, when the lilacs made 
a lane of purple to the road, the Major drove over 
with the news that “the boys would not be back 
again till autumn. They'll go abroad for the 
summer,” he added proudly. “It's time they were 
seeing something of the world, you know. I've 
always said that a man should see the world before 
thirty, if he wants to stay at home after forty,” then 
he smiled down on Virginia, and pinched her cheek. 
“It won't hurt Dan, my dear,” he said cheerfully.      
“Let him get a glimpse of artificial flowers, that he 
may learn the value of our own beauties.”</p>
                  <p>“Of Great-aunt Emmeline, you mean, sir,” replied 
Virginia, laughing.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, yes, my child,” chuckled the Major. “Let 
him learn the value of Great-aunt Emmeline, by all 
means.”</p>
                  <p>When the old gentleman had gone, Betty went 
into the garden, where the grass was powdered with 
small spring flowers, and gathered a bunch of white
violets for her mother. Aunt Lydia was walking 
slowly up and down in the mild sunshine, and her 
long black shadow passed over the girl as she knelt 
in the narrow grass-grown path. A slender spray 
of syringe drooped down upon her head,
<pb n="161"/>
and the warm wind was sweet with the heavy 
perfume of the lilacs. On the whitewashed fence a 
catbird was calling over the meadow, and another 
answered from the little bricked-up graveyard, 
where the gate was opened only when a fresh grave 
was to be hollowed out amid the periwinkle.</p>
                  <p>As Betty knelt there, something in the warm wind, 
the heavy perfume, or the old lady's flitting shadow 
touched her with a sudden melancholy, and while the 
tears lay upon her lashes, she started quickly to her 
feet and looked about her. But a great peace was in 
the air, and around her she saw only the garden 
wrapped in sunshine, the small spring flowers in 
bloom, and Aunt Lydia moving up and down in the 
box-bordered walk.</p>

                  <head>THE MEETING IN THE TURNPIKE</head>
                  <p>ON a late September afternoon Dan rode leisurely 
homeward along the turnpike. He had reached New 
York some days before, but instead of hurrying on 
with Champe, he had sent a careless apology to his 
expectant grandparents while he waited over to look 
up a missing trunk.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, what difference does a day make?” he had 
urged in reply to Champe's remonstrances, “and 
after going all the way to Paris, I can't afford to lose 
my clothes, you know. I'm not a Leander, my boy, 
and there's no Hero awaiting me. You can can't 
expect a fellow to sacrifice the proprieties for his 
grandmother.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'm going, that's all,” rejoined Champe, and 
Dan heartily responded, “God be with you,” as he 
shook his hand.</p>
                  <p>Now, as he rode slowly up the turnpike on a 
hired horse, he was beginning to regret, with an 
impatient self-reproach, the three tiresome days he 
had stolen from his grandfather's delight. It was 
characteristic of him at the age of twenty-one that 
he began to regret what appeared to be a pleasure 
only after it had proved to be a disappointment. Had 
the New York days been gay instead of dull, it is 
probable that he would have ridden home with
<pb n="163"/>
an easy conscience and a lordly belief that there was 
something generous in the spirit of his coming back 
at all.</p>
                  <p>A damp wind was blowing straight along the 
turnpike, and the autumn fields, brilliant with 
golden-rod and sumach, stretched under a sky which 
had clouded over so suddenly that the last rays of 
sun were still shining upon the mountains.</p>
                  <p>He had left Uplands a mile behind, throwing, as he 
passed, a wistful glance between the silver poplars. 
A pink dress had fluttered for an instant beyond the 
Doric columns, and he had wondered idly if it meant 
Virginia, and if she were still the pretty little 
simpleton of six months ago. At the thought of her he 
threw back his head and whistled gayly into the 
threatening sky, so gayly that a bluebird flying 
across the road hovered round him in the air. The joy 
of living possessed him at the moment, a mere 
physical delight in the circulation of his blood, in the 
healthy beating of his pulses. Old things which he 
had half forgotten appealed to him suddenly with all 
the force of fresh impressions. The beauty of the 
September fields, the long curve in the white road 
where the tuft of cedars grew, the falling valley 
which went down between the hills, stood out for him 
as if bathed in a new and tender light. The youth in 
him was looking through his eyes.</p>
                  <p>And the thought of Virginia went merrily with his 
mood. What a pretty little simpleton she was, by 
George, and what a dull world this would be were it 
not for the pretty simpletons in pink dresses! Why, in 
that case one might as well sit in
<pb n="164"/>
a library and read Horace and wear red flannel. One 
might as well—a drop of rain fell in his face and he 
lowered his head. When he did so he saw that Betty 
was coming along the turnpike, and that she wore a 
dress of blue dimity.</p>
                  <p>In a flash of light his first wonder was that he 
should ever have preferred pink to blue; his second 
that a girl in a dimity gown and a white chip bonnet 
should be fleeing from a storm along the turnpike. 
As he jumped from his horse he faced her a little 
anxiously.</p>
                  <p> “There's a hard shower coming, and you'll be 
wet,” he said.</p>
                  <p>“And my bonnet!” cried Betty, breathlessly. She 
untied the blue strings and swung them over her arm. 
There was a flush in her cheeks, and as he drew 
nearer she fell back quickly.</p>
                  <p>“You—you came so suddenly,” she stammered.</p>
                  <p>He laughed aloud. “Doesn't the Prince always come 
suddenly?” he asked. “You are like the wandering 
princess in the fairy tale—all in blue upon a lonely 
road; but this isn't just the place for loitering, you 
know. Come up behind me and I'll, carry you to 
shelter in Aunt Ailsey's cabin; it isn't the first time 
I've run away with you, remember.”  He lifted her 
upon the horse, and started at a gallop up the 
turnpike. “I'm afraid the steed doesn't take the 
romantic view,” he went on lightly. “There, get up, 
Barebones, the lady doesn't want to wet her bonnet. 
Lean against me, Betty, and I'll try to shelter you.”</p>
                  <p>But the rain was in their faces, and Betty shut
<pb n="165"/>
her eyes to keep out the hard bright drops. As she 
clung with both hands to his arm, her wet cheek was 
hidden against his coat, and the blue ribbons on her 
breast were blown round them in the wind. It was as 
if one of her dreams had awakened from sleep and 
come boldly out into the daylight; and because it was 
like a dream she trembled and was half ashamed of 
its reality.</p>
                  <p>“Here we are!” he exclaimed, in a moment, as he 
turned the horse round the blasted tree into the little 
path amid the vegetables. “If you are soaked 
through, we might as well go on; but if you're half 
dry, build a fire and get warm.” He put her down 
upon the square stone before the doorway, and 
slipping the reins over the branch of a young willow 
tree, followed her into the cabin. “Why, you're 
hardly damp,” he said, with his hand on her arm. “I 
got the worst of it.”</p>
                  <p>He crossed over to the great open fireplace, and 
kneeling upon the hearth raked a hollow in the old 
ashes; then he kindled a blaze from a pile of 
lightwood knots, and stood up brushing his hands 
together. “Sit down and get warm,” he said 
hospitably. “If I may take upon myself to do the 
duties of free Levi's castle, I should even invite you 
to make yourself at home.” With a laugh he glanced 
about the bare little room,—at the uncovered rafters, 
the rough log walls, and the empty cupboard with its 
swinging doors. In one corner there was a pallet 
hidden by a ragged patchwork quilt, and facing it a 
small pine table upon which stood an ashcake ready 
for the embers.</p>
                  <p>The laughter was still in his eyes when he looked
<pb n="166"/>
at Betty. “Now where's the sense of going walking 
in the rain?” he demanded.</p>
                  <p>“I didn't,” replied Betty, quickly. “It was 
clear when I started, and the clouds came up before I 
knew it. I had been across the fields to the woods, 
and I was coming home along the turnpike.” She 
loosened her hair, and kneeling upon the smooth 
stones, dried it before the flames. As she shook the 
curling ends a sparkling shower of rain drops was 
scattered over Dan.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I don't see much sense in that,” he 
returned slowly, with his gaze upon her.</p>
                  <p>She laughed and held out her moist hands to the 
fire. “Well, there was more than you see,” she 
responded pleasantly, and added, while she smiled at 
him with narrowed eyes, “dear me, you've grown so 
much older.”</p>
                  <p>“And you've grown so much prettier,” he retorted 
boldly.</p>
                  <p>A flush crossed her face, and her look grew a little 
wistful. “The rain has bewitched you,” she said.</p>
                  <p>“You may call me a fool if you like,” he pursued, 
as if she had not spoken, “but I did not know until 
to-day that you had the most beautiful hair in the 
world. Why, it is always sunshine about you.” He 
put out his hand to touch a loose curl that hung upon 
her shoulder, then drew it quickly back. “I don't 
suppose I might,” he asked humbly.</p>
                  <p>Betty gathered up her hair with shaking hands, 
which gleamed white in the firelight, and carelessly 
twisted it about her head.</p>
                  <pb n="167"/>
                  <p>“It is not nearly so pretty as Virginia's,” she said 
in a low voice.</p>
                  <p>“Virginia's? Oh, nonsense!” he exclaimed, and 
walked rapidly up and down the room.</p>
                  <p>Beyond the open door the rain fell heavily; he 
heard it beating softly on the roof and dripping down 
upon the smooth square stone before the threshold. 
A red maple leaf was washed in from the path and 
lay a wet bit of colour upon the floor. “I wonder 
where old man Levi is?” he said suddenly.</p>
                  <p>“In the rain, I'm afraid,” Betty answered, “and he 
has rheumatism, too; he was laid up for three 
months last winter.”</p>
                  <p>She spoke quietly, but she was conscious of a 
quiver from head to foot, as if a strong wind had 
swept over her. Through the doorway she saw the 
young willow tree trembling in the storm and felt 
curiously akin to it.</p>
                  <p>Dan came slowly back to the hearth, and leaning 
against the crumbling mortar of the chimney, looked 
thoughtfully down upon her. “Do you know what I 
thought of when I saw you with your hair down, 
Betty?”</p>
                  <p>She shook her head, smiling.</p>
                  <p>“I don't suppose I'd thought of it for years,” 
he went on quickly; “but when you took your hair 
down, and looked up at me so small and white. it all 
came back to me as if it were yesterday. I 
remembered the night I first came along this road—
God-forsaken little chap that I was—and saw you 
standing out there in your nightgown—with your 
little cold bare feet. The moonlight was full
<pb n="168"/>
upon you, and I thought you were a ghost. At first I 
wanted to run away; but you spoke, and I stood still 
and listened. I remember what it was, Betty.—‘Mr. 
Devil, I'm going in,’ you said. Did you take me for 
the devil, I wonder?”</p>
                  <p>She smiled up at him, and he saw her kind eyes 
fill with tears. The wavering smile only deepened the 
peculiar tenderness of her look.</p>
                  <p>“I had been sitting in the briers for an hour,” 
he resumed, after a moment; “it was a day and night 
since I had eaten a bit of bread, and I had been 
digging up sassafras roots with my bare fingers. I 
remember that I rooted at one for nearly an hour, 
and found that it was sumach, after all. Then I got 
up and went on again, and there you were standing 
in the moonlight—”He broke off, hesitated an 
instant, and added with the gallant indiscretion of 
youth, “By George, that ought to have made a man 
of me!”</p>
                  <p>“And you are a man,” said Betty.</p>
                  <p>“A man!” he appeared to snap his fingers at the 
thought. “I am a weather-vane, a leaf in the wind, 
a—an ass. I haven't known my own mind ten 
minutes during the last two years, and the only thing 
I've ever gone honestly about is my own pleasure. 
Oh, yes, I have the courage of my inclinations, I 
admit.”</p>
                  <p>“But I don't understand—what does it mean? 
—I don't understand,” faltered Betty, vaguely troubled 
by his mood.</p>
                  <p>“Mean? Why, it means that I've been ruined, and 
it's too late to mend me. I'm no better than a 
pampered poodle dog. It means that I've gotten
<pb n="169"/>
everything I wanted, until I begin to fancy there's 
nothing under heaven I can't get.” Then, in one of his 
quick changes of temper, his face cleared with a 
burst of honest laughter.</p>
                  <p>She grew merry instantly, and as she smiled up at 
him, he saw her eyes like rays of hazel light between 
her lashes. “Has the black crow gone?” she asked. 
“Do you know when I have a gray day Mammy calls 
it the black crow flying by. As long as his shadow is 
over you, there's always a gloom at the brain, she 
says. Has he quite gone by?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, he flew by quickly,” he answered, laughing, 
“he didn't even stay to flap his wings.” Then he 
became suddenly grave. “I wonder what kind of a 
man you'll fall in love with, Betty?” he said 
abruptly.</p>
                  <p>She drew back startled, and her eyes reminded him 
of those of a frightened wild thing he had come upon 
in the spring woods one day. As she shrank from 
him in her dim blue dress, her hair fell from its coil 
and lay like a gold bar across her bosom, which 
fluttered softly with her quickened breath.</p>
                  <p>“I? Why, how can I tell?” she asked.</p>
                  <p>“He'll not be black and ugly, I dare say?”</p>
                  <p>She shook her head, regaining her composure.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, no, fair and beautiful,” she answered.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, as unlike me as day from night?”</p>
                  <p>“As day from night,” she echoed, and went on 
after a moment, her girlish visions shining in her 
eyes:—</p>
                  <p>“He will be a man, at least,” she said slowly, “a
<pb n="170"/>
man with a faith to fight for—to live for—to make 
him noble. He may be a beggar by the roadside, but 
he will be a beggar with dreams. He will be forever 
travelling to some great end—some clear purpose.” 
The last words came so faintly that he bent nearer to 
hear. A deep flush swept to her forehead, and she 
turned from him to the fire. These were things that 
she had hidden even from Virginia.</p>
                  <p>But as he looked steadily down upon her, 
something of her own pure fervour was in his face. 
Her vivid beauty rose like a flame to his eyes, and 
for a single instant it seemed to him that he had 
never looked upon a woman until to-day.</p>
                  <p>“So you would sit with him in the dust of the 
roadside?” he asked, smiling.</p>
                  <p>“But the dust is beautiful when the sun shines on 
it,” answered the girl; “and on wet days we should 
go into the pine woods, and on fair ones rest in the 
open meadows; and we should sing with the robins, 
and make friends with the little foxes.”</p>
                  <p>He laughed softly. “Ah, Betty, Betty, I know you 
now for a dreamer of dreams. With all your 
pudding-mixing and your potato-planting you are 
moon-mad like the rest of us.”</p>
                  <p>She made a disdainful little gesture. “Why, I never 
planted a potato in my life.”</p>
                  <p>“Don't scoff, dear lady,” he returned warningly;  
“too great literalness is the sin of womankind, you 
know.”</p>
                  <p>“But I don't care in the least for 
vegetable-growing,” she persisted seriously.</p>
                  <pb n="171"/>
                  <p>The humour twinkled in his eyes. “Thriftless 
woman, would you prefer to beg?”</p>
                  <p>“When the Major rode by,” laughed Betty; “but 
when I heard you coming, I'd lie hidden among the 
briers, and I'd scatter signs for other gypsies that 
read,‘Beware the Montjoy.’”</p>
                  <p>His face darkened and he frowned. “So it's the 
Montjoy you're afraid of,” he rejoined gloomily.       
“I'm not all Lightfoot, though I'm apt to forget it; the 
Montjoy blood is there, all the same, and it isn't 
good blood.”</p>
                  <p>“Your blood is good,” said Betty, warmly.</p>
                  <p>He laughed again and met her eyes with a look of 
whimsical tenderness. “Make me your beggar, 
Betty,” he prayed, smiling.</p>
                  <p>“You a beggar!” She shook a scornful head. “I 
can shut my eyes and see your fortune, sir, and it 
doesn't lie upon the roadside. I see a well-fed country 
gentleman who rises late to breakfast and storms 
when the birds are overdone, who drinks his two 
cups of coffee and eats syrup upon his cakes—”</p>
                  <p>“O pleasant prophetess!” he threw in.</p>
                  <p>“I look and see him riding over the rich 
fields in the early morning, watching from horseback 
the planting and the growing and the ripening of the 
corn. He has a dozen servants to fetch the whip he 
drops, and a dozen others to hold his bridle when he 
pleases to dismount; the dogs leap round him in the 
drive, and he brushes away the one that licks his 
face. I see him grow stout and red-faced as he reads 
a dull Latin volume beside his bottle of old 
port—there's your fortune, sir, the silver, if you
<pb n="172"/>
please.” She finished in a whining voice, and rose to 
drop a courtesy.</p>
                  <p>“On my word, you're a witch, Betty,” he 
exclaimed, laughing, “a regular witch on a 
broomstick.”</p>
                  <p>“Does the likeness flatter you? Shall I touch it up 
a bit? Just a dash more of red in the face?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I reckon it's true as prophecy ever was,” he 
said easily. “It isn't likely that I'll ever be a beggar, 
despite your kindly wishes for my soul's welfare; 
and, on the whole, I think I'd rather not. When all's 
said and done, I'd rather own my servants and my 
cultivated acres, and come down late to hot cakes 
than sit in the dust by the roadside and eat sour 
grapes. It may not be so good for the soul, but it's 
vastly more comfortable; and I'm not sure that a fat 
soul in a lean body is the best of life, Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“At least it doesn't give one gout,” retorted Betty, 
mercilessly, adding as she went to the door: “but the 
rain is holding up, and I must be going. I'll borrow 
your horse, if you please, Dan.” She tied on her 
flattened bonnet, and with her foot on the threshold, 
stood looking across the wet fields, where each spear 
of grass pieced a string of shining rain drops. Over 
the mountains the clouds tossed in broken masses, 
and loose streamers of vapour drifted down into the 
lower foldings of the hills. The cool smell of the 
moist road came to her on the wind.</p>
                  <p>Dan unfastened the reins from the young willow, and 
led the horse to the stone at the entrance. Then he 
threw his coat over the dampened saddle and
<pb n="173"/>
lifted Betty upon it. “Pooh! I'm as tough as a pine 
knot.” He scoffed at her protests. “There, sit steady; 
I'd better hold you on, I suppose.”</p>
                  <p>Slipping the reins loosely over his arm, he laid 
his hand upon the blue folds of her skirt. “If you feel 
yourself going, just catch my shoulder,” he added;     
“and now we're off.”</p>
                  <p>They left the little path and went slowly down the 
turnpike, under the dripping trees. Across the fields 
a bird was singing after the storm, and tile notes 
were as fresh as the smell of the rain-washed earth. 
A fuller splendour seemed to have deepened 
suddenly upon the meadows, and the golden-rod ran 
in streams of fire across the landscape.</p>
                  <p>“Everything looks so changed,” said Betty, 
wistfully; “are you sure that we are still in the same 
world, Dan?”</p>
                  <p>“Sure?” he looked up at her gayly. “I'm sure of 
but one thing in this life, Betty, and that is that you 
should thank your stars you met me.”</p>
                  <p>“I don't doubt that I should have gotten home 
somehow,” responded Betty, ungratefully, “so don't 
flatter yourself that you have saved even my bonnet.” 
From its blue-lined shadow she smiled brightly down 
upon him.</p>
                  <p>“Well, all the same, I dare to be grateful,” he 
rejoined. “Even if you haven't saved my hat,—and I 
can't honestly convince myself that you have,—I 
thank my stars I met you, Betty.” He threw back his 
head and sang softly to himself as they went on 
under the scudding clouds.</p>

                  <head>IF THIS BE LOVE</head>
                  <p>AN hour later, Cephas, son of Cupid, gathering his 
basketful of chips at the woodpile, beheld his young 
master approaching by the branch road, and started 
shrieking for the house. “Hi! hit's Marse Dan! hit's 
Marse Dan!” he yelled to his father Cupid in the pantry; 
“I seed 'im fu'st! Fo' de Lawd, I seed 'im fu'st! ”and the 
Major, hearing the words, appeared instantly at the door 
of his library.</p>
                  <p>“It's the boy,” he called excitedly. “Bless my soul, 
Molly, the boy has come!”</p>
                  <p>The old lady came hurriedly downstairs, pinning on 
her muslin cap, and by the time Dan had dismounted at 
the steps the whole household was assembled to receive 
him.</p>
                  <p>“Well, well, my boy,” exclaimed the Major, moving 
nervously about, “this is a surprise, indeed. We didn't 
look for you until next week. Well, well.”</p>
                  <p>He turned away to wipe his eyes, while Dan 
caught his grandmother in his arms and kissed her a 
dozen times. The joy of these simple souls touched 
him with a new tenderness; he felt unworthy of his 
grandmother's kisses and the Major's tears. Why had 
he stayed away when his coming meant so
<pb n="175"/>										
much? What was there in all the world worth the 
closer knitting of these strong blood ties ?</p>
                  <p>“By George, but I'm glad to get here,” he said 
heartily. “There's nothing I've seen across the water 
that comes up to being home again; and the sight of 
your faces is better than the wonders of the world, I 
declare. Ah, Cupid, old man, I'm glad to see you. 
And Aunt Rhody and Congo, how are you all? Why, 
where's Big Abel? Don't tell me he isn't here to 
welcome me.”</p>
                  <p>“Hyer I is, young Marster, hyer I is,” cried Big 
Abel, stretching out his hand over Congo's head, and 
“Hyer I is, too,” shouted Cephas from behind him.   
“I seed you fu'st, fo' de Lawd, I seed you fu'st!”</p>
                  <p>They gathered eagerly round him, and with a 
laugh, and a word for one and all, he caught the 
outstretched hands, scattering his favours like a 
young Jove. “Yes, I've remembered you—there, 
don't smother me. Did you think I'd dare to show my 
face, Aunt Rhody, without the gayest neckerchief in 
Europe? Why, I waited over in New York just to 
see that it was safe. Oh, don't smother me, I say.” 
The dogs came bounding in, and he greeted them 
with much the same affectionate condescension, 
caressing them as they sprang upon him, and 
pushing away the one that licked his face. When the 
overseer ran in hastily to shake his hand, there was 
no visible change in his manner. He greeted black 
and white with a courtesy which marked the social 
line, with an affability which had a touch of the 
august. Had the gulf between them been less 
impassable, he would not have dared the hearty 
handshake, the genial word, the pat upon the head—
<pb n="176"/>											
these were a tribute which he paid to the very 
humble.</p>
                  <p>When the servants had streamed chattering out 
through the back door, he put his arms about the old 
people and led them into the library. “Why, what's 
become of Champe?” he inquired, glancing 
complacently round the book-lined walls.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, you mustn't expect to see anything of Champe 
these days,” replied the Major, waiting for Mrs. 
Lightfoot to be seated before he drew up his chair. 
“His heart's gone roving, I tell him, and he follows 
mighty closely after it. If you don't find him at 
Uplands, you've only to inquire at Powell Hall.”</p>
                  <p>“Uplands!” exclaimed Dan, hearing the one word. 
“What is he doing at Uplands?”</p>
                  <p>The  Major chuckled as he settled himself in his 
easy chair and stretched out his slippered feet.          
“Well, I should say that he was doing a very 
commendable thing, eh, Molly?” he rejoined 
jokingly.</p>
                  <p>“He's losing his head, if that's what you mean,” 
retorted the old lady.</p>
                  <p>“Not his head, but his heart, my dear,” blandly 
corrected the Major, “and I repeat that it is a very 
commendable thing to do—why, where would you 
be to-day, madam, if I hadn't fallen in love with 
you?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot sniffed as she unwound her 
knitting. “I don't doubt that I should be quite as well 
off, Mr. Lightfoot,” she replied convincingly.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, maybe so, maybe so,” admitted the Major, 
with a sigh; “but I'm very sure that I shouldn't be, 
my dear.”</p>
                  <pb n="177"/>
                  <p>The old lady softened visibly, but she only 
remarked:—</p>
                  <p>“I'm glad that you have found it out, sir,” and 
clicked her needles.</p>
                  <p>Dan, who had been wandering aimlessly about 
the room, threw himself into a chair beside his 
grandmother and caught at her ball of yarn.</p>
                  <p>“It's Virginia, I suppose,” he suggested.</p>
                  <p>The Major laughed until his spectacles clouded.</p>
                  <p>“Virginia!” he gasped, wiping the glasses upon 
his white silk handkerchief. “Listen to the boy, Molly, 
he believes every last one of us—myself to boot, I 
reckon—to be in love with Miss Virginia.”</p>
                  <p>“If he does, he believes as many men have done 
before him,” interposed Mrs. Lightfoot, with a 
homely philosophy.</p>
                  <p>“Well, isn't it Virginia?” asked Dan.</p>
                  <p>“I tell you frankly,” pursued the Major, in a 
confidential voice, “that if you want a rival with 
Virginia, you'll be apt to find a stout one in Jack 
Morson. He was back a week ago, and he's a fine 
fellow—a first-rate fellow. I declare, he came over 
here one evening and I couldn't begin a single 
quotation from Horace that he didn't know the end 
of it. On my word, he's not only a fine fellow, but a 
cultured gentleman. You may remember, sir, that I 
have always maintained that the two most refining 
influences upon the manners were to be found in the 
society of ladies and a knowledge of the Latin 
language.”</p>
                  <p>Dan gave the yarn an impatient jerk. “Tell me, 
grandma,” he besought her.</p>
                  <p>As was her custom, the old lady came quickly to
<pb n="178"/>
the point and appeared to transfix the question with 
the end of her knitting-needle. “I really think that it 
is Betty, my child,” she answered calmly.</p>
                  <p>“What does he mean by falling in love with 
Betty?” demanded Dan, while he rose to his feet, 
and the ball of yarn fell upon the floor.</p>
                  <p>“Don't ask me what he means, sir,” protested the 
Major. “If a man in love has any meaning in him, it 
takes a man in love to find it out. Maybe you'll be 
better at it than I am; but I give it up—I give it up.”</p>
                  <p>With a gloomy face Dan sat down again, and 
resting his arms on his knees, stared at the vase of 
golden-rod between the tall brass andirons. Cupid 
came in to light the lamps, and stopped to inquire if 
Mrs. Lightfoot would like a blaze to be started in the 
fireplace. “It's a little chilly, my dear,” remarked the 
Major, slapping his arm. “There's been a sharp 
change in the weather;” and Cupid removed the vase 
of golden-rod and laid an armful of sticks crosswise 
on the andirons.</p>
                  <p>“Draw up to the hearth, my boy,” said the Major, 
when the fire burned. “Even if you aren't cold, it 
looks cheerful, you know—draw up, draw up,” and 
he at once began to question his grandson about the 
London streets, evoking as he talked dim memories 
of his own early days in England. He asked after St. 
Paul's and Westminster Abbey half as if they were 
personal friends of whose death he feared to hear; 
and upon being answered that they still stood 
unchanged, he pressed eagerly for the gossip of the 
Strand and Fleet Street. Was Dr. Johnson's 
coffee-house still standing? and did Dan remember
			
<pb n="179"/>
to look up the haunts of Mr. Addison in his youth?        
“I've gotten a good deal out of Champe,” he confessed,    
“but I like to hear it again—I like to hear it. Why, it 
takes me back forty years, and makes me younger.”</p>
                  <p>And when Champe came in from his ride, he found 
the old gentleman upon the hearth-rug, his white hair 
tossing over his brow, as he recited from Mr. Addison 
with the zest of a schoolboy of a hundred years ago.</p>
                  <p>“Hello, Beau! I hope you got your clothes,” was 
Champe's greeting, as he shook his cousin's hand.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, they turned up all right,” said Dan, carelessly,   
“and, by-the-way, there was an India shawl for grandma 
in that very trunk.”</p>
                  <p>Champe crossed to the fireplace and stood fingering 
one of the tall vases. “It's a pity you didn't stop by 
Uplands,” he observed. “You'd have found Virginia 
more blooming than ever.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, is that so?” returned Dan, flushing, and a 
moment afterward he added with an effort, “I met Betty 
in the turnpike, you know.”</p>
                  <p>Six months ago, he remembered, he had raved out his 
passion for Virginia, and to-day he could barely 
stammer Betty's name. A great silence seemed to 
surround the thought of her.</p>
                  <p>“So she told me,” replied Champe, looking steadily at 
Dan. For a moment he seemed about to speak again; 
then changing his mind, he left the room with a casual 
remark about dressing for supper.</p>
                  <p>“I'll go, too,” said Dan, rising from his seat. “If 
you'll believe me, I haven't spoken to my old love,
<pb n="180"/>
Aunt Emmeline. So proud a beauty is not to be 
treated with neglect.”</p>
                  <p>He lighted one of the tall candles upon the 
mantel-piece, and taking it in his hand, crossed the 
hall and went into the panelled parlour, where 
Great-aunt Emmeline, in the lustre of her amber 
brocade, smiled her changeless smile from out the 
darkened canvas. There was wit in her curved lip 
and spirit in her humorous gray eyes, and the marble 
whiteness of her brow, which had brought her many 
lovers in her lifetime, shone undimmed beneath the 
masses of her chestnut hair. With her fair body gone 
to dust, she still held her immortal apple by the 
divine right of her remembered beauty.</p>
                  <p>As Dan looked at her it seemed to him for the first 
time that he found a likeness to Betty—to Betty as 
she smiled up at him from the hearth in Aunt 
Ailsey's cabin. It was not in the mouth alone, nor in 
the eyes alone, but in something indefinable which 
belonged to every feature—in the kindly fervour that 
shone straight out from the smiling face. Ah, he 
knew now why Aunt Emmeline had charmed a 
generation.</p>
                  <p>He blew out the candle, and went back into the 
hall where the front door stood half open. Then 
taking down his hat, he descended the steps and 
strolled thoughtfully up and down the gravelled 
drive.</p>
                  <p>The air was still moist, and beyond the gray 
meadows the white clouds huddled like a flock of 
sheep upon the mountain side. From the branches of 
the old elms fell a few yellowed leaves, and among 
them birds were flying back and forth with
<pb n="181"/>
short cries. A faint perfume came from the high urns 
beside the steps, where a flowering creeper was 
bruised against the marble basins.</p>
                  <p>With a cigar in his mouth, Dan passed slowly to 
and fro against the lighted windows, and looked up 
tenderly at the gray sky and the small flying birds. 
There was a glow in his face, for, with a total 
cessation of time, he was back in Aunt Ailsey's 
cabin, and the rain was on the roof.</p>
                  <p>In one of those rare moods in which the least 
subjective mind becomes that of a mystic, he told 
himself that this hour had waited for him from the 
beginning of time—had bided patiently at the 
crossroads until he came up with it at last. All his 
life he had been travelling to meet it, not in 
ignorance, but with half-unconscious knowledge, 
and all the while the fire had burned brightly on the 
hearth, and Betty had knelt upon the flat stones 
drying her hair. Again it seemed to him that he had 
never looked into a woman's face before, and the 
shame of his wandering fancies was heavy upon 
him. He called himself a fool because he had 
followed for a day the flutter of Virginia's gown, and 
a dotard for the many loves he had sworn to long 
before. In the twilight he saw Betty's eyes, grave, 
accusing, darkened with reproach; and he asked 
himself half hopefully if she cared—if it were 
possible for a moment that she cared. There had 
been humour in her smile, but, for all his effort, he 
could bring back no deeper emotion than pity or 
disdain—and it seemed to him that both the pity and 
the disdain were for himself.</p>
                  <p>The library window was lifted suddenly, as the
<pb n="182"/>
Major called out to him that “supper was on its way”; 
and, with an impatient movement of the shoulders, 
he tossed his cigar into the grass and went indoors.</p>
                  <p>The next afternoon he rode over to Uplands, and 
found Virginia alone in the dim, rose-scented 
parlour, where the quaint old furniture stood in the 
gloom of a perpetual solemnity. The girl, herself, 
made a bright spot of colour against the damask 
curtains, and as he looked at her he felt the same
delight in her loveliness that he felt in Great-aunt 
Emmeline's. Virginia had become a picture to him, 
and nothing more.</p>
                  <p>When he entered she greeted him with her old 
friendliness, gave him both her cool white hands, 
and asked him a hundred shy questions about the 
countries over sea. She was delicately cordial, 
demurely glad.</p>
                  <p>“It seems an age since you went away,” she said 
flatteringly, “and so many things have happened—
one of the big trees blew down on the lawn, and 
Jack Powell broke his arm—and—and Mr. Morson 
has been back twice, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, I know,” he answered, “but I rather think 
the tree's the biggest thing, isn't it?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, it is the biggest,” admitted Virginia, 
sweetly. “I couldn't get my arms halfway round 
it—and Betty was so distressed when it fell that 
she cried half the day, just as if it were a human
being. Aunt Lydia has been trying to build a rockery 
over the root, and she's going to cover it with 
portulaca.” She went to the long window and pointed 
out the spot where it had stood. “There
<pb n="183"/>
are so many one hardly misses it,” she added 
cheerfully.</p>
                  <p>At the end of an hour Dan asked timidly for Betty, 
to hear that she had gone riding earlier with 
Champe. “She is showing him a new path over the 
mountain,” said Virginia. “I really think she knows 
them all by heart.”</p>
                  <p>“I hope she hasn't taken to minding cattle,” 
observed Dan, irritably. “I believe in women 
keeping at home, you know,” and as he rose to go he 
told Virginia that she had “an Irish colour.”</p>
                  <p>“I have been sitting in the sun,” she answered 
shyly, going back to the window when he left the 
room.</p>
                  <p>Dan went quickly out to Prince Rupert, but with 
his foot in the stirrup, he saw Miss Lydia training a 
coral honeysuckle at the end of the portico, and 
turned away to help her fasten up a broken string.    
“It blew down yesterday,” she explained sadly. “The 
storm did a great deal of damage to the flowers, and 
the garden looked almost desolate this morning, but 
Betty and I worked there until dinner. I tell Betty she 
must take my place among the flowers, she has such 
a talent for making them bloom. Why, if you will 
come into the garden, you will be surprised to see 
how many summer plants are still in blossom.”</p>
                  <p>She spoke wistfully, and Dan looked down on her 
with a tender reverence which became him 
strangely. “Why, I shall be delighted to go with 
you,” he answered. “Do you know I never see you 
without thinking of your roses? You seem to carry 
their fragrance in your clothes,” There was a touch
<pb n="184"/>
of the Major's flattery in his manner, but Miss 
Lydia's pale cheeks flushed with pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Smiling faintly, she folded her knitted shawl over 
her bosom, and he followed her across the grass to 
the little whitewashed gate of the garden. There 
she entered softly, as if she were going into church, 
her light steps barely treading down the tall grass 
strewn with rose leaves. Beyond the high box 
borders the gay October roses bent toward her 
beneath a light wind, and in the square beds tangles 
of summer plants still flowered untouched by frost. 
The splendour of the scarlet sage and the delicate 
clusters of the four-o'clocks and sweet Williams 
made a single blur of colour in the sunshine, and 
under the neatly clipped box hedges, blossoms of 
petunias and verbenas straggled from their trim rows 
across the walk.</p>
                  <p>As he stood beside her, Dan drew in a long breath 
of the fragrant air. “I declare, it is like standing in a 
bunch of pinks,” he remarked.</p>
                  <p>“There has been no hard frost as yet,” returned 
Miss Lydia, looking up at him. “Even the verbenas 
were not nipped, and I don't think I ever had them 
bloom so late. Why, it is almost the first of 
October.”</p>
                  <p>They strolled leisurely up and down the 
box-bordered paths, Miss Lydia talking in her 
gentle, monotonous voice, and Dan bending his head 
as he flicked at the tall grass with his riding-whip.</p>
                  <p>“He is a great lover of flowers,” said the old lady 
after he had gone, and thought in her simple heart 
that she spoke the truth.</p>
                  <p>For two days Dan's pride held him back, but the
<pb n="185"/>
third being Sunday, he went over in the afternoon 
with the presence of a message from his 
grandmother. As the day was mild the great doors 
were standing open, and from the drive he saw Mrs. 
Ambler sitting midway of the hall, with her Bible in 
her hand and her class of little negroes at her feet. 
Beyond her there was a strip of green and the 
autumn glory of the garden, and the sunlight coming 
from without fell straight upon the leaves of the open 
book.</p>
                  <p>She was reading from the gospel of St. John, and 
she did not pause until the chapter was finished; then 
she looked up and said, smiling: “Shall I ask you to 
join my class, or will you look for the girls out of 
doors? Virginia, I think, is in the garden, and Betty 
has just gone riding down the tavern road.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I'll go after Betty,” replied Dan, promptly, 
and with a gay “good-by” he untied Prince Rupert 
and started at a canter for the turnpike.</p>
                  <p>A quarter of a mile beyond Uplands the tavern 
road branched off under a deep gloom of forest 
trees. The white sand of the turnpike gave place to a 
heavy clay soil, which went to dust in summer and to 
mud in winter, impeding equally the passage of 
wheels. On either side a thick wood ran for several 
miles, and the sunshine filtered in bright drops 
through the green arch overhead.</p>
                  <p>When Dan first caught sight of Betty she was 
riding in a network of sun and shade, her face lifted 
to the bit of blue sky that showed between the treetops. 
At the sound of his horse she threw a startled look 
behind her, and then, drawing aside from the
<pb n="186"/>
sunken ruts in the “corduroy” road, waited, 
smiling, until he galloped up.</p>
                  <p>“Why, it's never you!” she exclaimed, surprised.</p>
                  <p>“Well, that's not my fault, Betty,” he gayly 
returned. “If I had my way, I assure you it would be 
always I. You mustn't blame a fellow for his ill luck, 
you know.” Then he laid his hand on her bridle and 
faced her sternly.</p>
                  <p>“Look here, Betty, you haven't been treating me 
right,” he said.</p>
                  <p>She threw out a deprecating little gesture. “Do I 
need to put on more humility?” she questioned, 
humbly. “Is it respect that I have failed in, sir?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, bosh!” he interposed, rudely. “I want to 
know why you went riding three afternoons with 
Champe—it wasn't fair of you, you know.”</p>
                  <p>Betty sighed sadly. “No one has ever asked me 
before why I went riding with Champe,” she 
confessed, “and the mighty secret has quite gnawed 
into my heart.”</p>
                  <p>“Share it with me,” begged Dan, gallantly, “only 
I warn you that I shall have no mercy upon 
Champe.”</p>
                  <p>“Poor Champe,” said Betty.</p>
                  <p>“At least he went riding with you three 
afternoons—lucky Champe!”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, so he did; and must I tell you why?”</p>
                  <p>He nodded. “You shan't go home until you do,” 
he declared grimly.</p>
                  <p>Betty reached up and plucked a handful of aspen 
leaves, scattering them upon the road.</p>
                  <p>“By what right, O horse-taming Hector (isn't that 
the way they talk in Homer?)”</p>
                  <pb n="187"/>
                  <p>“By the right of the strongest, O fair Helena (it's 
the way they talk in translations of Homer).”</p>
                  <p>“How very learned you are!” sighed Betty.</p>
                  <p>“How very lovely you are!” sighed Dan.</p>
                  <p>“And you will really force me to tell you?” she 
asked.</p>
                  <p>“For your own sake, don't let it come to that,” he 
replied.</p>
                  <p>“But are you sure that you are strong enough to 
hear it?”</p>
                  <p>“I am strong enough for anything,” he assured 
her, “except suspense.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, if I must, then let me whisper it—I went 
because—” she drew back, “I implore you not to 
uproot the forest in your wrath.”</p>
                  <p>“Speak quickly,” urged Dan, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>“I went because—brace yourself—I went because 
he asked me.”</p>
                  <p>“O Betty!” he cried, and caught her hand.</p>
                  <p>“O Dan!” she laughed, and drew her hand away.</p>
                  <p>“You deserve to be whipped,” he went on sternly. 
“How dare you play with the green-eyed monster 
I'm wearing on my sleeve? Haven't you heard his 
growls, madam?”</p>
                  <p>“He's a pretty monster,” said Betty. “I should like 
to pat him.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, he needs to be gently stroked, I tell you.”</p>
                  <p>“Does he wake often—poor monster?”</p>
                  <p>Dan lowered his abashed eyes to the road.</p>
                  <p>“Well, that—ah, that depends—” he began 
awkwardly.</p>
                  <pb n="188"/>
                  <p>“Ah, that depends upon your fancies,” finished 
Betty, and rode on rapidly.</p>
                  <p>It was a moment before he came up with her, and 
when he did so his face was flushed.</p>
                  <p>“Do you mind about my fancies, Betty?” he 
asked humbly.</p>
                  <p>“I?” said Betty, disdainfully. “Why, what have 
I to do with them?”</p>
                  <p>“With my fancies? nothing—so help me God—
nothing.”</p>
                  <p>“I am glad to hear it,” she replied quietly, 
stroking her horse. Her cheeks were glowing and she 
let the overhanging branches screen her face. As they 
rode on silently they heard the rustling of the leaves 
beneath the horses' feet, and the soft wind playing 
through the forest. A chain of lights and shadows ran 
before them into the misty purple of the distance, 
where the dim trees went up like gothic spires.</p>
                  <p>Betty's hands were trembling, but fearing the 
stillness, she spoke in a careless voice.</p>
                  <p>“When do you go back to college?” she 
inquired politely.</p>
                  <p>“In two days—but it's all the same to you, I dare 
say.”</p>
                  <p>“Indeed it isn't. I shall be very sorry.”</p>
                  <p>“You needn't lie to me,” he returned irritably. “I 
beg your pardon, but a lie is a lie, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“So I suppose, but I wasn't Iying—I shall be very 
sorry.”</p>
                  <p>A fiery maple branch fell between them, and he 
impatiently thrust it aside.</p>
                  <p>“When you treat me like this you raise the devil 
in me,” he said angrily. “As I told you before,
<pb n="189"/>
Betty, when I'm not Lightfoot I'm Montjoy—it may 
be this that makes you plague me so.”</p>
                  <p>“O Dan, Dan!” she laughed, but in a moment 
added gravely: “When you're neither Lightfoot nor 
Montjoy, you're just yourself, and it's then, after all, 
that I like you best. Shall we turn now?” She 
wheeled her horse about on the rustling leaves, and 
they started toward the sunset light shining far up 
the road.</p>
                  <p>“When you like me best,” said Dan, passionately. 
“Betty, when is that?” His ardent look was on her 
face, and she, defying her fears, met it with her 
beaming eyes. “When you're just yourself, Dan,” 
she answered and galloped on. Her lips were 
smiling, but there was a prayer in her heart, for 
it cried, “Dear God, let him love me, let him love 
me.”</p>

                  <head>BETTY'S UNBELIEF</head>
                  <p>“DEAR God, let him love me,” she prayed again in 
the cool twilight of her chamber. Before the open 
window she put her hands to her burning cheeks and 
felt the wind trickle between her quivering fingers. 
Her heart fluttered like a bird and her blood went in 
little tremours through her veins. For a single instant 
she seemed to feel the passage of the earth through 
space. “Oh, let him love me! let him love me!” she 
cried upon her knees.</p>
                  <p>When Virginia came in she rose and turned to her 
with the brightness of tears on her lashes.</p>
                  <p>“Do you want me to help you, dear?” she asked, 
gently.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I'm all dressed,” answered Virginia, coming 
toward her. She held a lamp in her hand, and the 
light fell over her girlish figure in its muslin gown.   
“You are so late, Betty,” she added, stopping before 
the bureau. “Were you by yourself?”</p>
                  <p>“Not all the way,” replied Betty, slowly.</p>
                  <p>“Who was with you? Champe?”</p>
                  <p>“No, not Champe—Dan,” said Betty, stooping to 
unfasten her boots.</p>
                  <p>Virginia was pinning a red verbena in her hair, 
and she turned to catch a side view of her face.</p>
                  <p>“Do you know I really believe Dan likes you
<pb n="191"/>
best,” she carelessly remarked. “I asked him the 
other afternoon what colour hair he preferred, and 
he snapped out, ‘red’ as suddenly as that. Wasn't it 
funny?”</p>
                  <p>For a moment Betty did not speak; then she came 
over and stood beside her sister.</p>
                  <p>“Would you mind if he liked me better than you, 
dear?” she asked, doubtfully. “Would you mind the 
least little bit?”</p>
                  <p>Virginia laughed merrily and stooped to kiss her.</p>
                  <p>“I shouldn't mind if every man in the world liked 
you better,” she answered gayly. “If they only had 
as much sense as I've got, they would, foolish 
things.”</p>
                  <p>“I never knew but one who did,” returned Betty, 
“and that was the Major.”</p>
                  <p>“But Champe, too.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, perhaps,—but Champe's afraid of you. He 
calls you Penelope, you know, because of the 
‘wooers.’ We counted six horses at the portico 
yesterday, and he made a bet with me that all of 
them belonged to the‘wooers’—and they really did, 
too.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, but wooing isn't winning,” laughed Virginia, 
going toward the door. “You'd better hurry, Betty, 
supper's ready. I wouldn't touch my hair, if I were 
you, it looks just lovely.” Her white skirts fluttered 
across the dimly lighted hall, and in a moment Betty 
heard her soft step on the stair.</p>
                  <p>Two days later Betty told Dan good-by with 
smiling lips. He rode over in the early morning, 
when she was in the garden gathering loose rose 
leaves to scatter among her clothes. There had been
<pb n="192"/>
a sharp frost the night before, and now as it melted 
in the slanting sun rays, Miss Lydia's summer 
flowers hung blighted upon their stalks. Only the gay 
October roses were still in their full splendour. </p>
                  <p>“What an early Betty,” said Dan, coming up to 
her as she stood in the wet grass beside one of the 
quaint rose squares. “You are all dewy like a 
flower.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I had breakfast an hour ago,” she answered, 
giving him her moist hand to which a few petals 
were clinging.</p>
                  <p>“Ye Gods!  have I missed an hour? Why, I 
expected to sit waiting on the door-step until you 
had had your sleep out.”</p>
                  <p>“Don't you know if you gather rose leaves with 
the dew on them, their sweetness lasts twice as 
long?” asked Betty.</p>
                  <p>“So you got up to gather ye rosebuds, after 
all, and not to wish me God speed?” he said 
despondently.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I should have been up anyway,” replied 
Betty, frankly. “This is the loveliest part of the day, 
you know. The world looks so fresh with the first 
frost over it—only the poor silly summer flowers 
take cold and die.”</p>
                  <p>“If you weren't a rose, you'd take cold yourself,” 
remarked Dan, pointing, with his riding-whip, to the 
hem of her dimity skirt. “Don't stand in the grass 
like that, you make me shiver.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, the sun will dry me,” she laughed, stepping 
from the path to the bare earth of the rose bed.         
“Why, when you get well into the sunshine it feels 
like summer.” She talked on merrily, and he,
<pb n="193"/>
paying small heed to what she said, kept his ardent 
look upon her face. His joy was in her bright 
presence, in the beauty of her smile, in the kind eyes 
that shone upon him. Speech meant so little when he 
could put out his arm and touch her if he dared.</p>
                  <p>“I am going away in an hour, Betty,” he said, at 
last.</p>
                  <p>“But you will be back again at Christmas.”</p>
                  <p>“At Christmas! Heavens alive! You speak as if it 
were to-morrow.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, but time goes very quickly, you know.”</p>
                  <p>Dan shook his head impatiently. “I dare say it 
does with you,” he returned, irritably, “but it 
wouldn't if you were as much in love as I am.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, you ought to be used to it by now,” urged 
Betty, mercilessly. “You were in love last year, I 
remember.”</p>
                  <p>“Betty, don't punish me for what I couldn't help. 
You know I love you.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, no,” said Betty, nervously plucking rose 
leaves. “You have been too often in love before, my 
good Dan.”</p>
                  <p>“But I was never in love with you before,” 
retorted Dan, decisively.</p>
                  <p>She shook her head, smiling. “And you are not in 
love with me now,” she replied, gravely. “You have 
found out that my hair is pretty, or that I can mix a 
pudding; but I do not often let down my hair, and I 
seldom cook, so you'll get over it, my friend, never 
fear.”</p>
                  <p>He flushed angrily. “And if I do not get over it?” 
he demanded.</p>
                  <pb n="194"/>
                  <p>“If you do not get over it?” repeated Betty, 
trembling. She turned away from him, strewing a 
handful of rose leaves upon the grass. “Then I shall 
think that you value neither my hair nor my 
housekeeping,” she added, lightly.</p>
                  <p>“If I swear that I love you, will you believe me, 
Betty?”</p>
                  <p>“Don't tempt my faith, Dan, it's too small.”</p>
                  <p>“Whether you believe it or not, I do love you,” he 
went on. “I may have been a fool now and then 
before I found it out, but you don't think that was 
falling in love, do you? I confess that I liked a pair 
of fine eyes or rosy cheeks, but I could laugh about 
it even while I thought it was love I felt. I can't laugh 
about being in love with you, Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“I thank you, sir,” replied Betty, saucily.</p>
                  <p>“When I saw you kneeling by the fire in free Levi's 
cabin, I knew that I loved you,” he said, hotly.</p>
                  <p>“But I can't always kneel to you, Dan,” she 
interposed.</p>
                  <p>He put her words impatiently aside, “and what's 
more I knew then that I had loved you all my life 
without knowing it,” he pursued. “You may taunt 
me with fickleness, but I'm not fickle—I was merely 
a fool. It took me a long time to find out what I 
wanted, but I've found out at last, and, so help me 
God, I'll have it yet. I never went without a thing I 
wanted in my life.”</p>
                  <p>“Then it will be good for you,” responded Betty.   
“Shall I put some rose leaves into your pocket?” She 
spoke indifferently, but all the while she heard her 
heart singing for joy.</p>
                  <pb n="195"/>
                  <p>In the rage of his boyish passion, he cut brutally 
at the flowers growing at his feet.</p>
                  <p>“If you keep this up, you'll send me to the devil!” 
he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>She caught his hand and took the whip from his 
fingers. “Ah, don't hurt the poor flowers,” she 
begged, “they aren't to blame.”</p>
                  <p>“Who is to blame, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>She looked up wistfully into his angry face. “You 
are no better than a child, Dan,” she said, almost 
sadly. “and you haven't the least idea what you are 
storming so about. It's time you were a man, but you 
aren't, you're just—”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I know, I'm just a pampered poodle dog,” he 
finished, bitterly.</p>
                  <p>“Well, you ought to be something better, and you 
must be.”</p>
                  <p>“I'll be anything you please, Betty; I'll be 
President, if you wish it.”</p>
                  <p>“No, thank you, I don't care in the least for 
Presidents.”</p>
                  <p>“Then I'll be a beggar, you like beggars.”</p>
                  <p>“You'll be just yourself, if you want to please me, 
Dan,” she said earnestly. “You will be your best 
self—neither the flattering Lightfoot, nor the rude 
Montjoy. You will learn to work, to wait patiently, 
and to love one woman. Whoever she may be, I 
shall say, God bless her.”</p>
                  <p>“God bless her, Betty,” he echoed fervently, and 
added, “Since it's a man you want, I'll be a man, but 
I almost wish you had said a President. I could have 
been one for you. Betty.”</p>
                  <pb n="196"/>
                  <p>Then he held out his hand. “I don't suppose you 
will kiss me good-by?” he pleaded.</p>
                  <p>“No, I shan't kiss you good-by,” she answered.</p>
                  <p>“Never, Betty?”</p>
                  <p>Smiling brightly, she gave him her hand. “When 
you have loved me two years, perhaps,—or when 
you marry another woman. Good-by, dear, 
good-by.”</p>
                  <p>He turned quickly away and went up the little path 
to the gate. There he paused for an instant, looked 
back, and waved his hand. “Good-by, my darling!” 
he called, boldly, and passed under the honeysuckle 
arbour. As he mounted his horse in the drive he saw 
her still standing as he had left her, the roses falling 
about her, and the sunshine full upon her bended 
head.</p>
                  <p>Until he was hidden by the trees she watched him 
breathlessly, then, kneeling in the path, she laid her 
cheek upon the long grass he had trodden underfoot. 
“O my love, my love,” she whispered to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lydia called her from the house, and she 
went to her with some loose roses in her muslin 
apron. “Did you call me, Aunt Lydia?” she asked, 
lifting her radiant eyes to the old lady's face. “I 
haven't gathered very many leaves.”</p>
                  <p>“I wanted you to pot some white violets for me, 
dear,” answered Miss Lydia, from the back steps.    
“My winter garden is almost full, but there's a spot 
where I can put a few violets. Poor Mr. Bill asked 
for a geranium for his window, so I let him take 
one.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, let me pot them for you.” begged Betty,
<pb n="197"/>
eager to be of service. “Send Petunia for the 
trowel, and I'll choose you a lovely plant. It's 
too bad to see all the dear verbenas bitten by 
the frost.” She tossed a rose into Miss Lydia's 
hands, and went back gladly into the garden.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight after this the Major came over 
and besought her to return with him for a 
week at Chericoke. Mrs. Lightfoot had taken 
to her bed, he said sadly, and the whole place 
was rapidly falling to rack and ruin. “We need 
your hands to put it straight again,” he added, 
“and Molly told me on no account to come 
back without you. I am at your mercy, my 
dear.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, I should love to go,” replied Betty, 
with the thought of Dan at her heart. “I'll be 
ready in a minute,” and she ran upstairs to 
find her mother, and to pack her things.</p>
                  <p>The Major waited for her standing; and when 
she came down, followed by Petunia with her 
clothes, he helped her, with elaborate 
courtesy, into the old coach before the portico.</p>
                  <p>“It takes me back to my wedding day, 
Betty,” he said, as he stepped in after her and 
slammed the door. “It isn't often that I carry 
off a pretty girl so easily.”</p>
                  <p>“Now I know that you didn't carry off Mrs. 
Lightfoot easily,” returned Betty, laughing from 
sheer lightness of spirits. “She has told me 
the whole story, sir, from the evening that she 
wore the peach-blow brocade, that made you 
fall in love with her on the spot, to the day that 
she almost broke down at the altar. You had a 
narrow escape from bachelorship, sir, so you 
needn't boast.”</p>
                  <pb n="198"/>
                  <p>The Major chuckled in his corner. “I don't doubt 
that Molly told you so,” he replied, “but, between 
you and me, I don't believe it ever occurred to her 
until forty years afterwards. She got it out of one of 
those silly romances she reads in bed—and, take my 
word for it, you'll find it somewhere in the pages of 
her Mrs. Radcliffe, or her Miss Burney. Molly's a 
sensible woman, my child,—I'm the last man to deny 
it—but she always did read trash. You won't believe 
me, I dare say, but she actually tried to faint when I 
kissed her in the carriage after her wedding—and, 
bless my soul, I came to find that she had ‘Evelina’ 
tucked away under her cape.”</p>
                  <p>“Why, she is the most sensible woman  in the 
world,” said Betty, “and I'm quite sure that she was 
only fitting herself to your ideas, sir. No, you can't 
make me believe it of Mrs. Lightfoot.”</p>
                  <p>“My ideas never took the shape of an Evelina,” 
dissented the Major, warmly, “but it's a dangerous 
taste, my dear, the taste for trash. I've always said 
that it ruined poor Jane, with all her pride. She got 
into her head all kind of notions about that scamp 
Montjoy, with his pale face and his long black hair. 
Poor girl, poor girl! I tried to bring her up on Homer 
and Milton, but she took to her mother's bookshelf as 
a duck to water.” He wiped his eyes, and Betty 
patted his hand, and wondered if “the scamp 
Montjoy” looked the least bit like his son.</p>
                  <p>When they reached Chericoke she shook hands 
with the servants and ran upstairs to Mrs. Lightfoot's 
chamber. The old lady, in her ruffled nightcap,
<pb n="199"/>
which she always put on when she took to bed, was 
sitting upright under her dimity curtains, weeping 
over “Thaddeus of Warsaw.” There was a little 
bookstand at her bedside filled with her favourite 
romances, and at the beginning of the year she 
would start systematically to read from the first 
volume upon the top shelf to the last one in the 
corner near the door. “None of your newfangled 
writers for me, my dear,” she would protest, 
snapping her fingers at literature. “Why, they 
haven't enough sentiment to give their hero a 
title—and an untitled hero! I declare, I'd as lief have 
a plain heroine, and, before you know it, they'll be 
writing about their Sukey Sues, with pug noses, who 
eloped with their Bill Bates, from the nearest butcher 
shop. Ugh! don't talk to me about them! I opened one 
of Mr. Dickens's stories the other day and it was 
actually about a chimney sweep—a common 
chimney sweep from a workhouse! Why, I really felt 
as if I had been keeping low society.”</p>
                  <p>Now, as she caught sight of Betty, she laid aside 
her book, wiped her eyes on a stiffly folded 
handkerchief, and became cheerful at once. “I 
warned Mr. Lightfoot not to dare to show his face 
without you,” she began; “so I suppose he brought 
you off by force.”</p>
                  <p>“I was only too glad to come,” replied Betty, 
kissing her; “but what must I do for you first? Shall 
I rub your head with bay rum?”</p>
                  <p>“There's nothing on earth the matter with my 
head, child,” retorted Mrs. Lightfoot, promptly, 
“but you may go downstairs, as soon as you take
<pb n="200"/>
off your things, and make me some decent tea and 
toast. Cupid brought me up two waiters at dinner, 
and I wouldn't touch either of them with a ten-foot 
pole.”</p>
                  <p>Betty took off her bonnet and shawl and hung 
them on a chair. “I'll go down at once and see about 
it,” she answered, “and I'll make Car'line put away 
my things. It's my old room I'm to have, I suppose.”</p>
                  <p>“It's the whole house, if you want it, only don't let 
any of the darkies have a hand at my tea. It's their 
nature to slop.”</p>
                  <p>“But it isn't mine,” Betty answered her, and ran, 
laughing, down into the dining room.</p>
                  <p>“Dar ain' been no sich chunes sense young Miss 
rid away in de dead er de night time,” muttered 
Cupid, in the pantry. “Lawd, Lawd, I des wish 
you'd teck up wid Marse Champe, en move 'long 
over hyer fer good en all. I reckon dar 'ud be times, 
den, I reckon, dar 'ould.”</p>
                  <p>“There are going to be times now, Uncle Cupid,” 
responded Betty, cheerfully, as she arranged the tray 
for Mrs. Lightfoot. “I'm going to make some tea and 
toast right on this fire for your old Miss. You bring 
the kettle, and I'll slice the bread.”</p>
                  <p>Cupid brought the kettle, grumbling. “I ain' never 
hyern tell er sich a mouf es ole Miss es got,” he 
muttered. “I ain' sayin' nuttin' agin er stomick, case 
she ain' never let de stuff git down dat fur—en de 
stomick hit ain' never tase it yit.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, stop grumbling, Uncle Cupid,” returned 
Betty, moving briskly about the room. She brought 
the daintiest tea cup from the old sideboard, and
<pb n="201"/>
leaned out of the window to pluck a late microphylla 
rosebud from the creeper upon the porch. Then, 
with the bread on the end of a long fork, she sat 
before the fire and asked Cupid about the health and 
fortunes of the house servants and the field hands.</p>
                  <p>“I ain' mix wid no fiel' han's,” grunted Cupid, 
with a social pride befitting the Major. “Dar ain' no 
use er my mixin' en I ain' mix. Dey stay in dere 
place en I stay in my place—en dere place hit's de 
quarters, en my place hit's de dinin' 'oom.”</p>
                  <p>“But Aunt Rhody—how's she?” inquired Betty, 
pleasantly, “and Big Abel? He didn't go back to 
college, did he?”</p>
                  <p>“Zeke, he went,” replied Cupid, “en Big Abel he 
wuz bleeged ter stay behint 'case his wife Saphiry 
she des put 'er foot right down. Ef'n he 'uz gwine off 
again, sez she, she 'uz des gwine tu'n right in en git 
mah'ed agin. She ain' so sho', nohow, dat two 
husban's ain' better'n one, is Saphiry, en she got 
'mos' a min' ter try hit. So Big Abel he des stayed 
behint.”</p>
                  <p>“That was wise of Big Abel,” remarked Betty.     
“Now open the door, Uncle Cupid, and I'll carry this 
upstairs,” and as Cupid threw open the door. she 
went out, holding the tray before her.</p>
                  <p>The old lady received her graciously, ate the toast 
and drank the tea, and even admitted that it couldn't 
have been better if she had made it with her own 
hands. “I think that you will have to come and live 
with me, Betty,” she said good-humouredly. “What a 
pity you can't fancy one of those useless boys of 
mine. Not that I'd have you
<pb n="202"/>
marry Dan, child, the Major has spoiled him to 
death, and now he's beginning to repent it; but 
Champe, Champe is a good and clever lad and would 
make a mild and amiable husband, I am sure. Don't 
marry a man with too much spirit, my dear; if a man 
has any extra spirit, he usually expends it in 
breaking his wife's.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I shan't marry yet awhile,” replied Betty, 
looking out upon the falling autumn leaves.</p>
                  <p>“So I said the day before I married Mr. Lightfoot,” 
rejoined the old lady, settling her pillows, “and now, 
if you have nothing better to do, you might read me a 
chapter of ‘Thaddeus of Warsaw’; you will find it to 
be a book of very pretty sentiment.”</p>

                  <head>THE MONTJOY BLOOD</head>
                  <p>IN the morning Betty was awakened by the tapping of 
the elm boughs on the roof above her. An autumn wind 
was blowing straight from the west, and when she 
looked out through the small greenish panes of glass, 
she saw eddies of yellowed leaves beating gently against 
the old brick walls. Overhead light gray clouds were 
flying across the sky, and beyond the waving tree-tops a 
white mist hung above the dim blue chain of mountains.</p>
                  <p>When she went downstairs she found the Major, in 
his best black broadcloth, pacing up and down before 
the house. It was Sunday, and he intended to drive into 
town where the rector held his services.</p>
                  <p>“You won't go in with me, I reckon?” he ventured 
hopefully, when Betty smiled out upon him from the 
library window. “Ah, my dear, you're as fresh as the 
morning, and only an old man to look at you. Well, 
well, age has its consolations; you'll spare me a kiss, I 
suppose?”</p>
                  <p>“Then you must come in to get it,” answered Betty, her 
eyes narrowing. “Breakfast is getting cold, and Cupid is 
calling down Aunt Rhody's wrath upon your head.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I'll come, I'll come,” returned the Major, 
hurrying up the steps, and adding as he entered the
<pb n="204"/>
dining room, “My child, if you'd only take a fancy 
to Champe, I'd be the happiest man on earth.”</p>
                  <p>“Now I shan't allow any matchmaking on 
Sunday,” said Betty, warningly, as she prepared 
Mrs. Lightfoot's breakfast. “Sit down and carve the 
chicken while I run upstairs with this.”</p>
                  <p>She went out and came back in a moment, laughing 
merrily. “Do you know, she threatens to become 
bedridden now that I am here to fix her trays,” she 
explained, sitting down between the tall silver urns 
and pouring out the Major's coffee. “What an uncertain 
day you have for church,” she added as she gave his cup 
to Cupid.</p>
                  <p>With his eyes on her vivid face the old man 
listened rapturously to her fresh young voice—the 
voice, he said, that always made him think of clear 
water falling over stones. It was one of the things 
that came to her from Peyton Ambler, he knew, with 
her warm hazel eyes and the sweet, strong curve of 
her mouth. “Ah, but you're like your father,” he said 
as he watched her. “If you had brown hair you'd be 
his very image.”</p>
                  <p>“I used to wish that I had,” responded Betty, 
“but I don't now—I'd just as soon have red.” She was 
thinking that Dan did not like brown hair so much, 
and the thought shone in her face—only the Major, 
in his ignorance, mistook its meaning.</p>
                  <p>After breakfast he got into the coach and started 
off, and Betty, with the key basket on her arm, followed 
Cupid and Aunt Rhody into the storeroom. Then she 
gathered fresh flowers for the table, and went 
upstairs to read a chapter from the Bible to Mrs. 
Lightfoot.</p>
                  <pb n="205"/>
                  <p>The Major stayed to dinner in town, returning 
late in a moody humour and exhausted by his drive. As 
Betty brushed her hair before her bureau, she heard 
him talking in a loud voice to Mrs. Lightfoot, and 
when she went in at supper time the old lady called 
her to her bedside and took her hand.</p>
                  <p>“He has had a touch of the gout, Betty,” she 
whispered in her ear, “and he heard some news in 
town which upset him a little. You must try to cheer 
him up at supper, child.”</p>
                  <p>“Was it bad news?” asked Betty, in alarm.</p>
                  <p>“It may not be true, my dear. I hope it isn't, but, 
as I told Mr. Lightfoot, it is always better to believe 
the worst, so if any surprise comes it may be a 
pleasant one. Somebody told him in church—and 
they had much better have been attending to the 
service, I'm sure,—that Dan had gotten into trouble 
again, and Mr. Lightfoot is very angry about it. He 
had a talk with the boy before he went away, and 
made him promise to turn over a new leaf this 
year—but it seems this is the most serious thing that 
has happened yet. I must say I always told Mr. 
Lightfoot it was what he had to expect.”</p>
                  <p>“In trouble again?” repeated Betty, kneeling by 
the bed. Her hands went cold, and she pressed them 
nervously together.</p>
                  <p>“Of course we know very little about it, my dear,” 
pursued Mrs. Lightfoot. “All we have heard is that 
he fought a duel and was sent away from the 
University. He was even put into gaol for a night, I 
believe—a Lightfoot in a common dirty gaol! Well, 
well, as I said before, all we can do now is to expect 
the worst.”</p>
                  <pb n="206"/>
                  <p>“Oh, is that all?” cried Betty, and the leaping of 
her heart told her the horror of her dim foreboding. 
She rose to her feet and smiled brightly down upon 
the astonished old lady.</p>
                  <p>“I don't know what more you want,” replied Mrs. 
Lightfoot, tartly. “If he ever gets clean again after a 
whole night in a common gaol, I must say I don't see 
how he'll manage it. But if you aren't satisfied I can 
only tell you that the affair was all about some 
bar-room wench, and that the papers will be full of 
it. Not that the boy was anything but foolish,” she 
added hastily. “I'll do him the justice to admit that 
he's more of a fool than a villain—and I hardly 
know whether it's a compliment that I'm paying him 
or not. He got some quixotic notion into his head 
that Harry Maupin insulted the girl in his presence, 
and he called him to account for it. As if the honour 
of a barkeeper's daughter was the concern of any 
gentleman!”</p>
                  <p>“Oh!” cried Betty, and caught her breath. The 
word went out of her in a sudden burst of joy, but 
the joy was so sharp that a moment afterwards she 
hid her wet face in the bedclothes and sobbed softly 
to herself.</p>
                  <p>“I don't think Mr. Lightfoot would have taken it 
so hard but for Virginia,” said the old lady, with her 
keen eyes on the girl. “You know he has always 
wanted to bring Dan and Virginia together, and he 
seems to think that the boy has been dishonourable 
about it.”</p>
                  <p>“But Virginia doesn't care—she doesn't care,” 
protested Betty.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'm glad to hear it,” returned Mrs. Lightfoot,
<pb n="207"/>
relieved, “and I hope the foolish boy will stay away 
long enough for his grandfather to cool off. Mr. 
Lightfoot is a high-tempered man, my child. I've 
spent fifty years in keeping him at peace with the 
world. There now, run down and cheer him up.” </p>
                  <p>She lay back among her pillows, and Betty leaned 
over and kissed her with cold lips before she dried 
her eyes and went downstairs to find the Major.</p>
                  <p>With the first glance at his face she saw that 
Dan's cause was hopeless for the hour, and she set 
herself, with a cheerful countenance, to a discussion 
of the trivial happenings of the day. She talked 
pleasantly of the rector's sermon, of the morning 
reading with Mrs. Lightfoot, and of a great hawk 
that had appeared suddenly in the air and raised an 
outcry among the turkeys on the lawn. When these 
topics were worn threadbare she bethought herself 
of the beauty of the autumn woods, and lamented 
the ruined garden with its last sad flowers.</p>
                  <p>The Major listened gloomily, putting in a word 
now and then, and keeping his weak red eyes upon 
his plate. There was a heavy cloud on his brow, and 
the flush that Betty had learned to dread was in his 
face. Once when she spoke carelessly of Dan, he 
threw out an angry gesture and inquired if she         
“found Mrs. Lightfoot easier to-night?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I think so,” replied the girl, and then, 
as they rose from the table, she slipped her hand 
through his arm and went with him into the library.</p>
                  <p>“Shall I sit with you this evening?” she asked 
timidly. “I'd be so glad to read to you, if you would 
let me.”</p>
                  <pb n="208"/>
                  <p>He shook his head, patted her affectionately upon 
the shoulder, and smiled  down into her upraised 
face. “No, no, my dear, I've a little work to do,” he 
replied kindly. “There are a few papers I want to 
look over, so run up to Molly and tell her I sent my 
sunshine to her.”</p>
                  <p>He stooped and kissed her cheek; and Betty, with 
a troubled heart, went slowly up to Mrs. Lightfoot's 
chamber.</p>
                  <p>The Major sat down at his writing table, and 
spread his papers out before him. Then he raised the 
wick of his lamp, and with his pen in his hand, 
resolutely set himself to his task. When Cupid came 
in with the decanter of Burgundy, he filled a glass 
and held it absently against the light, but he did not 
drink it, and in a moment he put it down with so 
tremulous a hand that the wine spilled upon the 
floor.</p>
                  <p>“I've a touch of the gout, Cupid,” he said testily.   
“A touch of the gout that's been hanging over me for 
a month or more.”</p>
                  <p>“Huccome you ain' fit hit, Ole Marster?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I've been fighting it tooth and nail;” 
answered the old gentleman, “but there are some 
things that always get the better of you in the end, 
Cupid, and the gout's one of them.”</p>
                  <p>“En rheumaticks hit's anurr,” added Cupid, 
rubbing his knee.</p>
                  <p>He rolled a fresh log upon the andirons and went 
out, while the Major returned, frowning, to his work.</p>
                  <p>He was still at his writing table, when he heard 
the sound of a horse trotting in the drive, and an
			
<pb n="209"/>
instant afterwards the quick fall of the old brass 
knocker. The flush deepened in his face, and with a 
fool; at once angry and appealing, he half rose from 
his chair. As he waited the outside bars were 
withdrawn, there followed a few short steps across 
the hall, and Dan came into the library.</p>
                  <p>“I suppose you know what's brought me back, 
grandpa?” he said quietly as he entered.</p>
                  <p>The Major started up and then sat down again.</p>
                  <p>“I do know, sir, and I wish to God I didn't,” he 
replied, choking in his anger.</p>
                  <p>Dan stood where he had halted upon his entrance, 
and looked at him with eyes in which there was still 
a defiant humour. His face was pale and his hair 
hung in black streaks across his forehead. The white 
dust of the turnpike had settled upon his clothes, and 
as he moved it floated in a little cloud about him.</p>
                  <p>“I reckon you think it's a pretty bad thing, eh?” 
he questioned coolly, though his hands trembled.</p>
                  <p>The Major's eyes flashed ominously from beneath 
his heavy brows.</p>
                  <p>“Pretty bad?” he repeated, taking a long breath. 
“If you want to know what I think about it, sir, I 
think that it's a damnable disgrace. Pretty bad!—By 
God, sir, do you call having a gaol-bird for a 
grandson pretty bad?”</p>
                  <p>“Stop, sir!” called Dan, sharply. He had steadied 
himself to withstand the shock of the Major's 
temper, but, in the dash of his youthful folly, he had 
forgotten to reckon with his own. “For heaven's 
sake, let's talk about it calmly,” he added irritably.</p>
                  <pb n="210"/>
                  <p>“I am perfectly calm, sir!” thundered the 
rising to his feet. The terrible flush went in a wave 
to his forehead, and he put up one quivering hand to 
loosen his high stock. “I tell you calmly that you've 
done a damnable thing; that you've brought disgrace upon 
the name of Lightfoot.”</p>
                  <p>“It is not my name,” replied Dan, lifting his head. 
”My name is Montjoy, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“And it's a name to hang a dog for,” retorted the 
Major.</p>
                  <p>As they faced each other with the same flash of 
temper kindling in both faces, the likeness between 
them grew suddenly more striking. It was as if the 
spirit of the fiery old man had risen, in a finer and 
younger shape, from the air before him.</p>
                  <p>“At all events it is not yours,” said Dan, hotly. 
Then he came nearer, and the anger died out of his 
eyes. “Don't let's quarrel, grandpa,” he pleaded.       
“I've gotten into a mess, and I'm sorry for it—on my 
word I am.”</p>
                  <p>“So you've come whining to me to get you out,” 
returned the Major, shaking as if he had gone 
suddenly palsied.</p>
                  <p>Dan drew back and his hand fell to his side.</p>
                  <p>“So help me God, I'll never whine to you again,” 
he answered.</p>
                  <p>“Do you want to know what you have done, sir?” 
demanded the Major. “You have broken your 
grandmother's heart and mine—and made us wish 
that we had left you by the roadside when you came 
crawling to our door. And, on my oath, if I had 
known that the day would ever come when you 
would try to murder a Virginia gentleman for the
<pb n="211"/>
sake of a bar-room hussy, I would have left you there, 
sir.”</p>
                  <p>“Stop!” said Dan again, looking at the old man with, 
his mother's eyes.</p>
                  <p>“You have broken your grandmother's heart and 
mine,” repeated the Major, in a trembling voice, “and I 
pray to God that you may not break Virginia 
Ambler's—poor girl, poor girl!”</p>
                  <p>“Virginia Ambler!” said Dan, slowly. “Why, there 
was nothing between us, nothing, nothing.”</p>
                  <p>“And you dare to tell me this to my face, sir?” cried 
the Major.</p>
                  <p>“Dare! of course I dare,” returned Dan, defiantly.
“If there was ever anything at all it was upon my side 
only—and a mere trifling fancy.”</p>
                  <p>The old gentleman brought his hand down upon his 
table with a blow that sent the papers fluttering to the 
floor. “Trifling!” he roared. “Would you trifle with a 
lady from your own state, sir?”</p>
                  <p>“I was never in love with her,” exclaimed Dan, 
angrily.</p>
                  <p>“Not in love with her? What business have you
not to be in love with her?” retorted the Major,
tossing back his long white hair. “I have given
her to understand that you are in love with her,
sir.”</p>
                  <p>The blood rushed to Dan's head, and he stumbled 
over an ottoman as he turned away.</p>
                  <p>“Then I call it unwarrantable interference,” he 
said brutally, and went toward the door. There the Major's 
flashing eyes held him back an instant.</p>
                  <p>“It was when I believed you to be worthy of 
her,” went on the old man, relentlessly, “when—
<pb n="212"/>
fool that I was—I dared to hope that dirty blood 
could be made clean again; that Jack Montjoy's son 
could be a gentleman.”</p>
                  <p>For a moment only Dan stood motionless and 
looked at him from the threshold. Then, without 
speaking, he crossed the hall, took down his hat, and 
unbarred the outer door. It slammed after him, and 
he went out into the night.</p>
                  <p>A keen wind was still blowing, and as he descended 
the steps he felt it lifting the dampened hair from his 
forehead. With a breath of relief he stood bareheaded 
in the drive and raised his face to the cool elm leaves 
that drifted slowly down. After the heated atmosphere 
of the library there was something pleasant in the mere 
absence of light, and in the soft rustling of the branches 
overhead. The humour of his blood went suddenly quiet 
as if he had plunged headlong into cold water.</p>
                  <p>While he stood there motionless his thoughts were 
suspended, and his senses, gaining a brief mastery, 
became almost feverishly alert; he felt the night wind 
in his face, he heard the ceaseless stirring of the 
leaves, and he saw the sparkle of the gravel in the 
yellow shine that streamed from the library 
windows. But with his first step, his first movement, 
there came a swift recoil of his anger, and he told 
himself with a touch of youthful rhetoric, “that 
come what would, he was going to the devil—and 
going speedily.”</p>
                  <p>He had reached the gate and his hand was upon 
the latch, when he heard the house door open and 
shut behind him and his name called softly from the 
steps.</p>
                  <pb n="213"/>
                  <p>He turned impulsively and stood waiting, while 
Betty came quickly through the lamplight that fell in 
squares upon the drive.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, come back, Dan, come back,” she said 
breathlessly.</p>
                  <p>With his hand still on the gate he faced her, 
frowning.</p>
                  <p>“I'd die first, Betty,” he answered.</p>
                  <p>She came swiftly up to him and stood, very pale, in 
the faint starlight that shone between the broken 
clouds. A knitted shawl was over her shoulders, but 
her head was bare and her hair made a glow around 
her face. Her eyes entreated him before she spoke.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Dan, come back,” she pleaded.</p>
                  <p>He laughed angrily and shook his head.</p>
                  <p>“I'll die first, Betty,” he repeated. “Die! I'd die a 
hundred times first!”</p>
                  <p>“He is so old,” 
she said appealingly. “It is not as 
if he were young and quite himself, Dan—Oh, it is 
not like that—but he loves you, and he is so old.”</p>
                  <p>“Don't, Betty,” he broke in quickly, and added 
bitterly, “Are you, too, against me?”</p>
                  <p>“I am for the best in you,” she answered quietly, 
and turned away from him.</p>
                  <p>“The best!” he snapped his fingers impatiently.   
“Are you for the shot at Maupin? the night I spent 
in gaol? or the beggar I am now? There's an equal 
choice, I reckon.”</p>
                  <p>She looked gravely up at him.</p>
                  <p>“ I am for the boy I've always known,” she replied,  
“and for the man who was here two weeks
<pb n="214"/>
ago—and—yes, I am for the man who stands here 
now. What does it matter, Dan? What does it 
matter?” </p>
                  <p>“O, Betty!” he cried breathlessly, and hid his face 
in his hands. </p>
                  <p>“And most of all, I am for the man you are going 
to be,” she went on slowly, “for the great man who 
is growing up. Dan, come back!”</p>
                  <p>His hands fell from his eyes. “I'll not do that 
even for you, Betty,” he answered, “and, God knows, 
there's little else I wouldn't do for you—there's 
nothing else.”</p>
                  <p>“What will you do for yourself, Dan? ”</p>
                  <p>“For myself?” his anger leaped out again, and he 
steadied himself against the gate. “For myself I'll go 
as far as I can from this damned place. I wish to God 
I'd fallen in the road before I came here. I wish I'd 
gone after my father and followed in his steps. I'll 
live on no man's charity, so help me God. Am I a 
dog to be kicked out and to go whining back when 
the door opens? Go—I'll go to the devil, and be glad 
of it!” For a moment Betty did not answer. Her 
hands were clasped on her bosom, and her eyes were 
dark and bright in the pallor of her face. As he 
looked at her the rage died out of his voice, and it 
quivered with a deeper feeling.</p>
                  <p>“My dear, my dearest, are you, too, against me?” 
he asked.</p>
                  <p>She met his gaze without flinching, but the bright 
colour swept suddenly to her cheeks and dyed them
crimson.</p>
                  <pb n="215"/>
                  <p>“Then if you will go, take me with you,” she 
said.</p>
                  <p>He fell back as if a star had dropped at his feet. For 
a breathless instant she saw only his eyes, and they drew 
her step by step. Then he opened his arms and she went straight 
into them.</p>
                  <p>“Betty, Betty,” he said in a whisper, and kissed 
her lips.</p>
                  <p>She put her hands upon his shoulders, and stood 
with his arms about her, looking up into his face.</p>
                  <p>“Take me with you—oh, take me with you,” she 
entreated. “I can't be left. Take me with you.”</p>
                  <p>“And you love me—Betty, do you love me?”</p>
                  <p>“I have loved you all my life—all my life,” she 
answered; “how can I begin to unlove you now—
now when it is too late? Do you think I am any the 
less yours if you throw me away? If you break my 
heart can I help its still loving you?”</p>
                  <p>“Betty, Betty,” he said again, and his voice 
quivered.</p>
                  <p>“Take me with you,” she repeated passionately. 
saying it over and over again with her lips upon his 
arm.</p>
                  <p>He stooped and kissed her almost roughly, and 
then put her gently away from him.</p>
                  <p>“It is the way my mother went,” he said, “and 
God help me, I am my father's son. I am afraid, 
—afraid—do you know what that means?”</p>
                  <p>“But I am not afraid,” answered the girl steadily.</p>
                  <p>He shivered and turned away; then he came back 
and knelt down to kiss her skirt. “No, I can't take
<pb n="216"/>
you with me,” he went on rapidly, “but if I live to be 
a man I shall come back—I—will come back—and 
you—”</p>
                  <p>“And I am waiting,” she replied.</p>
                  <p>He opened the gate and passed out into the road.</p>
                  <p>“I will come back, beloved,” he said again, and 
went on into the darkness.</p>
                  <p>Leaning over the gate she strained her eyes into 
the shadows, crying his name out into the night. Her 
voice broke and she hid her face in her arm; then, 
fearing to lose the last glimpse of him, she looked up 
quickly and sobbed to him to come back for a 
moment—but for a moment. It seemed to her, 
clinging there upon the gate, that when he went out 
into the darkness he had gone forever—that the thud 
of his footsteps in the dust was the last sound that 
would ever come from him to her ears.</p>
                  <p>Had he looked back she would have gone straight 
out to him, had he raised a finger she would have 
followed with a cheerful face; but he did not look 
back, and at last his footsteps died away upon the 
road.</p>
                  <p>When she could see or hear nothing more of him, 
she turned slowly and crept toward the house. Her 
feet dragged under her, and as she walked she cast 
back startled glances at the gate. The rustling of the 
leaves made her stand breathless a moment, her 
hand at her bosom; but it was only the wind, and 
she went step by step into the house, turning upon 
the threshold to throw a look behind her.</p>
                  <p>In the hall she paused and laid her hand upon the 
library door, but the Major had bolted her out, and
<pb n="217"/>
she heard him pacing with restless strides up and 
down the room. She listened timidly awhile, then, 
going softly by, went up to Mrs. Lightfoot.</p>
                  <p>The old lady was asleep, but as the girl entered 
she awoke and sat up, very straight, in bed. “My 
pain is much worse, Betty,” she complained. “I 
don't expect to get a wink of sleep this entire night.”</p>
                  <p>“I thought you were asleep when I came in,” 
answered Betty, keeping away from the candlelight; 
“but I am so sorry you are in pain. Shall I make 
you a mustard plaster?”</p>
                  <p>Though she smiled, her voice was spiritless and 
she moved with an effort. She felt suddenly very 
tired, and she wanted to lie down somewhere alone 
in the darkness.</p>
                  <p>“I'd just dropped off when Mr. Lightfoot woke 
me slamming the doors,” pursued the old lady, 
querulously. “Men have so little consideration that 
nothing surprises me, but I do think he might be 
more careful when he knows I am suffering. No, I 
won't take the mustard plaster, but you may bring 
me a cup of hot milk, if you will. It sometimes sends 
me off into a doze.”</p>
                  <p>Betty went slowly downstairs again and heated the 
milk on the dining-room fire. When it was ready she 
daintily arranged it upon a tray and carried it 
upstairs. “I hope it will do you good,” she said 
gently as she gave it to the old lady. “You must try 
to lie quiet—the doctor told you so.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot drank the milk and remarked 
amiably that it was “very nice though a little 
smoked—and now, go to bed, my dear,” she added
<pb n="218"/>			
kindly. “I mustn't keep you from your beauty sleep. 
I'm afraid I've worn you out as it is.”</p>
                  <p>Betty smiled and shook her head; then she I laced 
the tray upon a chair, and went out, softly closing 
the door after her.</p>
                  <p>In her own room she threw herself upon her bed, and 
cried for Dan until the morning.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>X</head>
                  <head>THE ROAD AT MIDNIGHT</head>
                  <p>WHEN Dan went down into the shadows of the road, 
he stopped short before he reached the end of the 
stone wall, and turned for his last look at Chericoke. 
He saw the long old house, with its peaked roof over 
which the elm boughs arched, the white stretch of 
drive before the door, and the leaves drifting 
ceaselessly against the yellow squares of the library 
windows. As he looked Betty came slowly from the 
shadow by the gate, where she had lingered, and 
crossed the lighted spaces amid the falling leaves. 
On the threshold, as she turned to throw a glance 
into the night, it seemed to him, for a single instant, 
that her eyes plunged through the darkness into his 
own. Then, while his heart still bounded with the 
hope, the door opened, and shut after her, and she 
was gone.</p>
                  <p>For a moment he saw only blackness—so sharp 
was the quick shutting off of the indoor light. The 
vague shapes upon the lawn showed like mere 
drawings in outline, the road became a pallid blur 
in the formless distance, and the shine of the 
lamplight on the drive shifted and grew dim as if a 
curtain had dropped across the windows. Like a white 
thread on the blackness he saw the glimmer beneath 
his grandmother's shutters, and it was as
<pb n="220"/>
if he had looked in from the high top of an elm and 
seen her lying with her candle on her breast.</p>
                  <p>As he stood there the silence of the old house 
knocked upon his heart like sound—and quick fears 
sprang up within him of a sudden death, or of Betty 
weeping for him somewhere alone in the stillness. 
The long roof under the waving elm boughs lost, for 
a heartbeat, the likeness of his home, and became, as 
the clouds thickened in the sky, but a great mound of 
earth over which the wind blew and the dead leaves 
fell.</p>
                  <p>But at last when he turned away and followed the 
branch road, his racial temperament had triumphed 
over the forebodings of the moment; and with the 
flicker of a smile upon his lips, he started briskly 
toward the turnpike. As the mind in the first ecstasy 
of a high passion is purified from the stain of mere 
emotion, so the Major, and the Major's anger, were 
forgotten, and his own bitter resentment swept as 
suddenly from his thoughts. He was overpowered 
and uplifted by the one supreme feeling from which 
he still trembled. All else seemed childish and of 
small significance beside the memory of Betty's lips 
upon his own. What room had he for anger when he 
was filled to overflowing with the presence of love?</p>
                  <p>The branch road ran out abruptly into the 
turnpike, and once off the familiar way by his 
grandfather's stone wall, he felt the blackness of the 
night close round him like a vault. Without a lantern 
there was small hope of striking the tavern or the 
tavern road till morning. To go on meant a night 
upon the roadside or in the fields.</p>
                  <pb n="221"/>
                  <p>As he stretched out his arm, groping in the 
blackness, he struck suddenly upon the body of the 
blasted tree, and coming round it, his eyes caught 
the red light of free Levi's fire, and he heard the 
sound of a hammer falling upon heated iron. The 
little path was somewhere in the darkness, and as he 
vainly sought for it, he stumbled over a row of 
stripped and headless cornstalks which ran up to the 
cabin door. Once upon the smooth stone before the 
threshold, he gave a boyish whistle and lifted his 
hand to knock. “It is I, Uncle Levi—there are no 
‘hants’ about,” he cried.</p>
                  <p>The hammer was thrown aside, and fell upon the 
stones, and a moment afterward, the door flew back 
quickly, showing the blanched face of free Levi 
and the bright glow of the hearth. “Dis yer ain' 
no time fur pranks,” said the old man, angrily. 
“Ain't yer ever gwine ter grow up, yit?” and he 
added, slowly, “Praise de Lawd hit's you instid 
er de devil.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it's I, sure enough,” returned Dan, lightly,
as he came into the cabin. “I'm on my way to Merry 
Oaks Tavern, Uncle Levi,—it's ten miles off, you 
know, and this blessed night is no better than an 
ink-pot. I'd positively be ashamed to send such a 
night down on a respectable planet. It's that old 
lantern of yours I want, by the way, and in case it 
doesn't turn up again, take this to buy a new one. 
No, I can't rest to-night. This is my working time, 
and I must be up and doing.” He reached for the 
rusty old lantern behind the door, and lighted it, 
laughing as he did so. His face was pale, and there 
was a nervous tremor in his
<pb n="222"/>
hands, but his voice had lost none of its old 
heartiness. “Ah, that's it, old man,” he said, when 
the light was ready. “We'll shake hands in case it's a 
long parting. This is a jolly world, Uncle Levi,—
good-by, and God bless you,” and, leaving the old 
man speechless on the hearth, he closed the door and 
went out into the night.</p>
                  <p>On the turnpike again, with the lantern swinging in 
his hand, he walked rapidly in the direction of the 
tavern road, throwing quick flashes of light before 
his footsteps. Behind him he heard the falling of free 
Levi's hammer, and knew that the old negro was 
toiling at his rude forge for the bread which he 
would to-morrow eat in freedom.</p>
                  <p>With the word he tossed back his hair and quickened 
his steps, as if he were leaving servitude behind him 
in the house at Chericoke; and, as the anger blazed 
up within his heart he found pleasure in the 
knowledge that at last he was starting out to level his 
own road. Under the clouds on the long turnpike it 
all seemed so easy—as easy as the falling of free 
Levi's hammer, which had faded in the distance.</p>
                  <p>What was it, after all? A year or two of struggle 
and of attainment, and he would come back flushed 
with success, to clasp Betty in his arms. In a 
dozen different ways he pictured to himself the 
possible manner of that home-coming, obliterating the 
year or two that lay between. He saw himself a 
great lawyer from a little reading and a single 
speech, or a judge upon his bench., famed for his 
classic learning and his grave decisions. He had 
only to choose, he felt, and he might be anything—
<pb n="223"/>
had they not told him so at college? did not even his 
grandfather admit it? He had only to choose—and, 
oh, he would choose well—he would choose to be a 
man, and to come riding back with his honours thick 
upon him.</p>
                  <p>Looking ahead, he saw himself a few years hence, 
as he rode leisurely homeward up the turnpike, while 
the stray countrymen he met took off their harvest 
hats, and stared wonderingly long after he was gone. 
He saw the Governor hastening to the road to shake 
his hand, he saw his grandfather bowed with the 
sense of his injustice, tremulous with the flutter of 
his pride; and, best of all! he saw Betty—Betty, with 
the rays of light beneath her lashes, coming straight 
across the drive into his arms.</p>
                  <p>And then all else faded slowly from him to 
give place to Betty, and he saw her growing, 
changing, brightening, as he had seen her from her 
childhood up. The small white figure in the moonlight, 
the merry little playmate, hanging on his footsteps, 
eager to run his errands, the slender girl, with 
the red braids and the proud shy eyes, and the 
woman who knelt upon the hearth in Aunt Ailsey's 
cabin, smiling up at him as she dried her hair—
all gathered round him now illuminated against the 
darkness of the night. Betty, Betty,—he whispered 
her name softly beneath his breath, he spoke it 
aloud in the silence of the turnpike, he even cried 
it out against the mountains, and waited for the 
echo—Betty, Betty. There was not only sweetness 
in the thought of her, there was strength also. The 
hand that had held him back when he would have
<pb n="224"/>
gone out blindly in his passion was the hand of a 
woman, not of a girl—of a woman who could face 
life smiling because she felt deep in herself the 
power to conquer it. Two days ago she had been but 
the girl he loved, to-night, with her kisses on his lips, 
she had become for him at once a shield and a 
religion. He looked outward and saw her influence a 
light upon his pathway; he turned his gaze within 
and found her a part of the sacred forces of his 
life—of his wistful childhood, his boyish purity, 
and the memory of his mother.</p>
                  <p>He had passed Uplands, and now, as he followed 
the tavern way, he held the flash of his lantern 
near the ground, and went slowly by the crumbling 
hollows in the strip of “corduroy” road. There was 
a thick carpet of moist leaves underfoot, and above 
the wind played lightly among the overhanging 
branches. His lantern made a shining circle in the 
midst of a surrounding blackness, and where the 
light fell the scattered autumn leaves sent out gold 
and scarlet flashes that came and went as quickly as 
a flame. Once an owl flew across his path, and 
startled by the lantern, blindly fluttered off again. 
Somewhere in the distance he heard the short  bark 
of a fox; then it died away, and there was no sound 
except the ceaseless rustle of the trees.</p>
                  <p>By the time he came out of the wood upon the open 
road, his high spirits had gone suddenly down, and 
the visions of an hour ago showed stale and lifeless 
to his clouded eyes. After a day's ride and a poor 
dinner, the ten-mile walk had left him with aching 
limbs, and a growing conviction that despite his 
former aspirations, he was fast going to the
<pb n="225"/>
devil along the tavern road. When at last he swung 
open the whitewashed gate before the inn, and threw 
the light of his lantern on the great oaks in the yard, 
the relief he felt was hardly brighter than despair, 
and it made very little difference, he grimly told 
himself, whether he put up for the night or kept the 
road forever. With a clatter he went into the little 
wooden porch and knocked upon the door.</p>
                  <p>He was still knocking when a window was raised 
suddenly above him, and a man's voice called out,     
“if he wanted a place for night-hawks to go on to 
hell.” Then, being evidently a garrulous body, the 
speaker leaned comfortably upon the sill, and sent 
down a string of remarks, which Dan promptly 
shortened with an oath.</p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongue, Jack Hicks,” he cried, angrily, 
“and come down and open this door before I break it 
in. I've walked ten miles to-night and I can't stand 
here till morning. How long has it been since you 
had a guest?”</p>
                  <p>“There was six of 'em changin' stages this 
mornin',” drawled Jack, in reply, still hanging from 
the sill. “I gave 'em a dinner of fried chicken and 
battercakes, and two of 'em being Yankees hadn't 
never tasted it befo'—and a month ago one dropped 
in to spend the night—”</p>
                  <p>He broke off hastily, for his wife had joined him 
at the window, and as Dan looked up with the flash 
of the lantern in his face, she gave a cry and called 
his name.</p>
                  <p>“Put on your clothes and go down, you fool,” 
she said, “it's Mr. Dan—don't you see it's Mr. Dan, 
and he's as white as yo' nightshirt. Go down, I
<pb n="226"/>
tell you,—go down and let him in.” There was a 
skurrying in the room and on the staircase, and a 
moment later the door was flung open and a lamp 
flashed in the darkness.</p>
                  <p>“Walk in, suh, walk right in,” said Jack Hicks, 
hospitably, “day or night you're welcome—as 
welcome as the Major himself.” He drew back and 
stood with the lamplight full upon him—a loose, 
ill-proportioned figure, with a flabby face and pale 
blue eyes set under swollen lids.</p>
                  <p>“I want something to eat, Jack,” returned Dan, 
as he entered and put down his lantern, “and a place to 
sleep—in fact I want anything you have to offer.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as Mrs. Hicks appeared upon the stair, he 
greeted her, despite his weariness, with something of 
his old jesting manner. “I am begging a supper,” he 
remarked affably, as he shook her hand, “and I may 
as well confess, by the way, that I am positively 
starving.”</p>
                  <p>The woman beamed upon him, as women always 
did, and while she led the way into the little dining 
room, and set out the cold meat and bread upon the 
oil-cloth covering of the table, she asked him eager 
questions about the Major and Mrs. Lightfoot, which 
he aroused himself to parry with a tired laugh. She 
was tall and thin, with a wrinkled brown face, and a 
row of curl papers about her forehead. Her faded 
calico wrapper hung loosely over her nightgown, and 
he saw her bare feet through the cracks in her 
worn-out leather slippers.</p>
                  <p>“The poor young gentleman is all but dead,” she 
said at last. “You give him his supper,  Jack,
<pb n="227"/>
and I'll go right up to fix his room. To think of his 
walkin' ten miles in the pitch blackness—the poor 
young gentleman.”</p>
                  <p>She went out, her run down slippers flapping on 
the stair, and Dan, as he ate his ham and bread, 
listened impatiently to the drawling voice of Jack 
Hicks, who discussed the condition of the country 
while he drew apple cider from a keg into a white 
china pitcher. As he talked, his fat face shone with a 
drowsy good-humour, and his puffed lids winked 
sleepily over his expressionless blue eyes. He moved 
heavily as if his limbs were forever coming in the 
way of his intentions.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, suh, I never was one of them folks 
as ain't satisfied unless they're always a-fussin',” 
he remarked, as he placed the pitcher upon the 
table. “Thar's a sight of them kind in these here 
parts, but I ain't one of 'em. Lord, Lord, I tell 
'em, befo' you git ready to jump out of the fryin' 
pan, you'd better make mighty sure you ain't fixin' 
to land yo'self in the fire. That's what I always 
had agin these here abolitionists as used to come 
pokin' round here—they ain't never learned to set 
down an' cross thar hands, an' leave the Lord to mind 
his own business. Bless my soul, I reckon they'd have 
wanted to have a hand in that little fuss of Lucifer's 
if they'd been alive—that's what I tell 'em, suh. 
An' now thar's all this talk about the freein' of the 
niggers—free? What are they goin' to do with 'em 
after they're done set 'em free? Ain't they the sons 
of Ham? I ask 'em; an' warn't they made to be servants 
of servants like the Bible says? It's a bold man 
that goes plum agin the Bible, and flies
<pb n="228"/>
smack into the face of God Almighty—it's a bold 
man, en' he ain't me, suh. What I say is, if the Lord 
can stand it, I reckon the rest of the country—”</p>
                  <p>He paused to draw breath, and Dan laid down his 
knife and fork and pushed back his chair. “Before 
you begin again, Jack,” he said coolly, “will you 
spare enough wind to carry me upstairs?”</p>
                  <p>“That's what I tell 'em,” pursued Jack amiably, as 
he lighted a candle and led the way into the hall.       
“They used to come down here every once in a while 
an' try to draw me out; and one of 'em 'most got a 
coat of tar an' feathers for meddlin' with my man 
Lacy; but if the Lord—here we are, here we are.”</p>
                  <p>He stopped upon the landing and opened the door 
of a long room, in which Mrs. Hicks was putting the 
last touches to the bed. She stopped as Dan came in, 
and by the pale flicker of a tallow candle stood 
looking at him from the threshold. “If you'll jest 
knock on the floor when you wake up, I'll know 
when to send yo' hot water,” she said, “and if thar's 
anything else you want, you can jest knock agin.”</p>
                  <p>With a smile he thanked her and promised to 
remember; and then as she went out into the hall, he 
bolted the door, and threw himself into a chair beside 
the window. Sleep had quite deserted him, and the 
dawn was on the mountains when at last he lay down 
and closed his eyes.</p>

                  <head>XI</head>
                  <head>AT MERRY OAKS TAVERN</head>
                  <p>UPON awaking his first thought was that he had got  
“into a deucedly uncomfortable fix,” and when he 
stretched out his hand from the bedside the need of fresh 
clothes appeared less easy to be borne than the more 
abstract wreck of his career. For the first time he clearly 
grasped some outline of his future—a future in which a 
change of linen would become a luxury; and it was with 
smarting eyes and a nervous tightening of the throat that 
he glanced about the long room, with its whitewashed 
walls, and told himself that he had come early to the end 
of his ambition. In the ill-regulated tenor of his thoughts 
but a hair's breadth divided assurance from despair. Last 
night the vaguest hope had seemed to be a certainty; 
to-day his fat acres and the sturdy slaves upon them had 
vanished like a dream, and the building of his fortunes 
had become suddenly a very different matter from the 
rearing of airy castles along the road.</p>
                  <p>As he lay there, with his strong white hands 
folded upon the quilt, his eyes went beyond the little 
lattice at the window, and rested upon the dark gray 
chain of mountains over which the white clouds sailed 
like birds. Somewhere nearer those mountains he knew 
that Chericoke was standing under the clouded
<pb n="230"/>
sky, with the half-bared elms knocking night and day 
upon the windows. He could see the open doors, 
through which the wind blew steadily, and the 
crooked stair down which his mother had come in 
her careless girlhood.</p>
                  <p>It seemed to him, lying there, that in this one hour 
he had drawn closer into sympathy with his mother, 
and when he looked up from his pillow, he half 
expected to see her merry eyes bending over him, 
and to feel her thin and trembling hand upon his 
brow. His old worship of her awoke to life, and he 
suffered over again the moment in his childhood 
when he had called her and she had not answered, 
and they had pushed him from the room and told him 
she was dead. He remembered the clear white of her 
face, with the violet shadows in the hollows; and he 
remembered the baby lying as if asleep upon her 
bosom. For a moment he felt that he had never 
grown older since that day—that he was still a child 
grieving for her loss—while all the time she was not 
dead, but stood beside him and smiled down upon 
his pillow. Poor mother, with the merry eyes and the 
bitter mouth.</p>
                  <p>Then as he looked the face grew younger, though 
the smile did not change, and he saw that it was
Betty, after all—Betty with the tenderness in her
eyes and the motherly yearning in her outstretched 
arms. The two women he loved were forever blended 
in his thoughts, and he dimly realized that whatever 
the future made of him, he should be moulded less 
by events than by the hands of these two women. 
Events might subdue, but love alone could create the 
spirit that gave him life.</p>
                  <pb n="231"/>
                  <p>There was a tap at his door, and when he arose 
and opened it, Mrs. Hicks handed in a pitcher of hot 
water and inquired “if he had recollected to knock 
upon the floor?”</p>
                  <p>He set the water upon the table, and after he had 
dressed brushed hopelessly, with a trembling hand, 
at the dust upon his clothes. Then he went to the 
window and stood gloomily looking down among the 
great oak trees to the strip of yard where a pig was 
rooting in the acorns.</p>
                  <p>A small porch ran across the entrance to the inn, and 
Jack Hicks was already seated on it, with a pipe in 
his mouth, and his feet upon the railing. His drowsy 
gaze was turned upon the woodpile hard by, where 
an old negro slave was chopping aimlessly into a 
new pine log, and a black urchin gathering chips into 
a big split basket. At a little distance the Hopeville 
stage was drawn out under the trees, the empty 
shafts lying upon the ground, and on the box a red 
and black rooster stood crowing. Overhead there 
was a dull gray sky, and the scene, in all its ugliness, 
showed stripped of the redeeming grace of lights and 
shadows.</p>
                  <p>Jack Hicks, smoking on his porch, presented a 
picture of bodily comfort and philosophic ease of 
mind. He was owner of some rich acres, and his 
possessions, it was said, might have been readily 
doubled had he chosen to barter for them the peace 
of perfect inactivity. To do him justice the idea had 
never occurred to him in the light of a temptation, 
and when a neighbour had once remarked in his 
hearing that he “reckoned Jack would rather lose a 
dollar than walk a mile to fetch it,” he had
<pb n="232"/>											
answered blandly, and without embarrassment, that 
“a mile was a goodish stretch on a sandy road.” So 
he sat and dozed beneath his sturdy oaks, while his 
wife went ragged at the heels and his swarm of 
tow-headed children rolled contentedly with the pigs 
among the acorns.</p>
                  <p>Dan was still looking moodily down into the yard, 
when he heard a gentle pressure upon the handle of 
his door, and as he fumed, it opened quickly and Big 
Abel, bearing a large white bundle upon his 
shoulders, staggered into the room.</p>
                  <p>“Ef'n you'd des let me knowed hit, I could er 
brung a bigger load,” he remarked sternly.</p>
                  <p>While he drew breath Dan stared at him with the 
blankness of surprise. “Where did you come from, 
Big Abel?” he questioned at last, speaking in a 
whisper.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel was busily untying the sheet he had 
brought, and spreading out the contents upon the 
bed, and he did not pause as he sullenly answered:—</p>
                  <p>“Ole Marster's.”</p>
                  <p>“Who sent you?”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel snorted. “Who gwine sen' me?” he 
demanded in his turn.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I declare,” said Dan, and after a moment,  
“how did you get away, man?”</p>
                  <p>“Lawd, Lawd,” returned Big Abel, “I wa'n' 
bo'n yestiddy nur de day befo'.  Terreckly I seed you 
a-cuttin' up de drive, I knowed dar wuz mo' den wuz 
in de tail er de eye, en w'en you des lit right out 
agin en bang de do' behint you fitten ter bus' hit,

wa'drobe. I got out one er ole Miss's sheets w'en
<pb n="233"/>											
she wa'n' lookin, en I tie up all de summer close de

you gwine be back fo' de summer right plum hyer. 
I'se done heah a do' bang befo' now, en dars mo' in it 
den des de shettin' ter stay shet.”</p>
                  <p>“So you ran away?” said Dan, with a long 
whistle.</p>
                  <p>“Ain't you done run away?”</p>
                  <p>“I—oh, I was turned out,” answered the young 
man, with his eyes on the negro. “But—bless my 
soul, Big Abel, why did you do it?”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel muttered something beneath his breath, 
and went on laying out the things.</p>
                  <p>“How you gwine git dese yer close ef I ain' tote 
'em 'long de road?” he asked presently. “How you 
gwine git dis yer close bresh ef I ain' brung hit ter 
you? Whar de close you got? Whar de close 
bresh?”</p>
                  <p>“You're a fool, Big Abel,” retorted Dan. “Go 
back where you belong and don't hang about me any 
more. I'm a beggar, I tell you, and I'm likely to be a 
beggar at the judgment day.”</p>
                  <p>“Whar de close bresh?” repeated Big Abel, 
scornfully.</p>
                  <p>“What would Saphiry say, I'd like to know?” went 
on Dan. “It isn't fair to Saphiry to run off this way.”</p>
                  <p>“Don' you bodder 'bout Saphiry,” responded Big 
Abel. “I'se done loss my tase fur Saphiry, young 
Marster.”</p>
                  <p>“I tell you you're a fool,” snapped out Dan, 
sharply.</p>
                  <p>“De Lawd he knows,” piously rejoined Big Abel,
<pb n="234"/>											
and he added: “Dar ain' no use a-rumpasin' case 
hyer I is en hyer I'se gwine ter stay. Whar you run, 
dar I'se gwine ter run right atter, so 'tain' no use 
a-rumpasin'. Hit's a pity dese yer ain' nuttin' but 
summer close.”</p>
                  <p>Dan looked at him a moment in silence, then he 
put out his hand and slapped him upon the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>“You're a fool—God bless you,” he said.</p>
                  <p>“Go 'way f'om yer, young Marster,” responded 
the negro, in a high good-humour. “Dar's a speck er 
dut right on yo' shut.”</p>
                  <p>“Then give me another,” cried Dan, gayly, and 
threw off his coat.</p>
                  <p>When he went down stairs, carefully brushed, a 
half-hour afterward, the world had grown suddenly 
to wear a more cheerful aspect. He greeted Mrs. 
Hicks with his careless good-humour, and spoke 
pleasantly to the dirty white-haired children that 
streamed through the dining room.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, I'll take my breakfast now, if you please,” 
he said as he sat down at one end of the long, 
oilcloth-covered table. Mrs. Hicks brought him his 
coffee and cakes, and then stood, with her hands 
upon a chair back, and watched him with a frank 
delight in his well-dressed comely figure.</p>
                  <p>“You do favour the Major, Mr. Dan,” she 
suddenly remarked.</p>
                  <p>He started impatiently. “Oh, the Lightfoots are all 
alike, you know,” he responded. “We are fond of 
saying that a strain of Lightfoot blood is good for 
two centuries of intermixing.” Then, as he looked up 
at her faded wrapper and twisted curl papers, he 
flinched and turned away as if her ugliness
<pb n="235"/>										
afflicted his eyes. “Do not let me keep you,” he 
added hastily.</p>
                  <p>But the woman stooped to shake a child that was 
tugging at her dress, and talked on in her drawling 
voice, while a greedy interest gave life to her worn 
and sallow face. “How long do you think of 
stayin'?” she asked curiously, “and do you often take 
a notion to walk so fur in the dead of night? Why, I 
declar, when I looked out an' saw you I couldn't 
believe my eyes. That's not Mr. Dan, I said, you 
won't catch Mr. Dan out in the pitch darkness with a 
lantern and ten miles from home.”</p>
                  <p>“I really do not want to keep you,” he broke in 
shortly, all the good-humour gone from his voice.</p>
                  <p>“Thar ain't nothin' to do right now,” she answered 
with a searching look into his face. “I was jest 
waitin' to bring you some mo' cakes.” She went out 
and came in presently with a fresh plateful. “I 
remember jest as well the first time you ever took 
breakfast here,” she said. “You wasn't more'n 
twelve, I don't reckon, an' the Major brought you by 
in the coach, with Big Abel driving. The Major didn't 
like the molasses we gave him, and he pushed the 
pitcher away and said it wasn't fit for pigs; and then 
you looked about real pears and spoke up, ‘It's good 
molasses, grandpa, I like it.’ Sakes alive, it seems 
jest like yestiddy. I don't reckon the Major is comin' 
by to-day, is he?”</p>
                  <p>He pushed his plate away and rose hurriedly, then, 
without replying, he brushed past her, and went out 
upon the porch.</p>
                  <p>There he found Jack Hicks, and forced himself
<pb n="236"/>
squarely into a discussion of his altered fortunes. “I 
may as well tell you, Jack,” he said, with a touch of 
arrogance, “that I'm turned out upon the world, at 
last, and I've got to make a living. I've left Chericoke 
for good, and as I've got to stay here until I find a 
place to go, there's no use making a secret of it.”</p>
                  <p>The pipe dropped from Jack's mouth, and he 
stared back in astonishment.</p>
                  <p>“Bless my soul and body!” he exclaimed. “Is the 
old gentleman crazy or is you?”</p>
                  <p>“You forget yourself,” sharply retorted Dan.</p>
                  <p>“Well, well,” pursued Jack, good-naturedly, as he 
knocked the ashes from his pipe and slowly refilled 
it. “If you hadn't have told me, I wouldn't have 
believed you—well, well.” He put his pipe into his 
mouth and hung on it for a moment; then he took it 
out and spoke thoughtfully. “I reckon I've known 
you from a child, haven't I, Mr. Dan?” he asked.</p>
                  <p>“That's so, Jack,” responded the young man,        
“and if you can recommend me, I want you to help 
me to a job for a week or two—then I'm off to 
town.”</p>
                  <p>“I've known you from a child year in an' year 
out,” went on Jack, blandly disregarding the interruption.
“From the time you was sech a pleasant-spoken little 
boy that it did me good to bow to you. when you rode by 
with the Major. ‘Thar's not another like him in the 
country,’ I said to Bill Bates, an' he said to me, ‘Thar's 
not a man between here an' Leicesterburg as ain't ready to say 
the same.’ Then time went on an' you got bigger, an' the year
<pb n="237"/>
came when the crops failed an' Sairy got sick, an' I took 
a mortgage on this here house—an' what should happen 
but that you stepped right up an' paid it out of yo' own 
pocket. And you kept it from the Major. Lord, Lord, to 
think the Major never knew which way the money 
went.”</p>
                  <p>“We won't speak of that,” said Dan, throwing back 
his head. The thought that the innkeeper might be going 
to offer him the money stung him into anger.</p>
                  <p>But Jack knew his man, and he would as soon have 
thought of throwing a handful of dust into his face.        
“Jest as you like, suh, jest as you like,” he returned 
easily, and went on smoking.</p>
                  <p>Dan sat down in a chair upon the porch, and taking 
out his knife began idly whittling at the end of a stick. A 
small boy, in blue jean breeches, watched him eagerly 
from the steps, and he spoke to him pleasantly while he 
cut into the wood.</p>
                  <p>“Did you ever see a horse's head on a cane, sonny?”</p>
                  <p>The child sucked his dirty thumb and edged nearer.</p>
                  <p>“Naw, suh but I've seen a dawg's,” he answered, 
drawing out his thumb like a stopper and sticking it in 
again.</p>
                  <p>“Well, you watch this and you'll see a horse's. There, 
now don't take your eyes away.”</p>
                  <p>He whittled silently for a time, then as he looked up 
his glance fell on the stagecoach in the yard, and he 
turned from it to Jack Hicks.</p>
                  <p>“There's one thing on earth I know about, Jack,” he 
said,“ and that's a horse.”</p>
                  <pb n="238"/>
                  <p>“Not a better jedge in the county, suh,” was Jack's 
response.</p>
                  <p>As Dan whittled a flush rose to his face. “Does 
Tom Hyden still drive the Hopeville stage?” he 
asked.</p>
                  <p>“Well, you see it's this way,” answered Jack, 
weighing his words. “Tom he's a first-rate hand at 
horses, but he drinks like a fish, and last week he 
married a wife who owns a house an' farm up the 
road. So long as he had to earn his own livin' he kept 
sober long enough to run the stage, but since he's 
gone and married, he says thar's no call fur him to 
keep a level head—so he don't keep it. Yes, that's 
about how 'tis, suh.”</p>
                  <p>Dan finished the stick and handed it to the child.   
“I tell you what, Jack,” he said suddenly, “I want 
Tom Hyden's place, and I'm going to drive that stage 
over to Hopeville this afternoon. Phil Banks runs it, 
doesn't he?—well, I know him.” He rose and stood 
humorously looking out upon the coach. “There's no 
time like the present,” he added, “so I begin work 
to-day.”</p>
                  <p>Jack Hicks silently stared up at him for a moment; 
then he coughed and exclaimed hoarsely: -</p>
                  <p>“The jedgment ain't fur off,” but Dan laughed the 
prophecy aside and went upstairs to write to Betty.</p>
                  <p>“I've got a job, Big Abel,” he began, going into 
his room, where the negro was pressing a pair of trousers 
with a flatiron, “and what's more it will keep me till 
I get another.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel gloomily shook his head. “We all 'ud des 
better go 'long home ter Ole Miss,” he returned,
<pb n="239"/>
for he was in no mood for compromises. “Caze I 
ain' use ter de po' w'ite trash en dey ain' use ter me.”</p>
                  <p>“Go if you want to,” retorted Dan, sternly, “but 
you go alone,” and the negro, protesting under his 
breath, laid the clothes away and went down to his 
breakfast.</p>
                  <p>Dan sat down by the window and wrote a letter to 
Betty which he never sent. When he thought of her 
now it was as if half the world instead of ten miles 
lay between them; and quickly as he would have 
resented the hint of it from Jack Hicks, to himself he 
admitted that he was fast sinking where Betty could 
not follow him. What would the end be? he asked, 
and disheartened by the question, tore the paper into 
bits and walked moodily up and down the room. He 
had lived so blithely until to-day! His lines had fallen 
so smoothly in the pleasant places! Not without a 
grim humour he remembered now that last year his 
grievance had been that his tailor failed to fit him. 
Last year he had walked the floor in a rage because 
of a wrinkled coat, and to-day- His road had gone 
rough so suddenly that he stumbled like a blind man 
when he tried to go over it in his old buoyant 
manner.</p>
                  <p>An hour later he was still pacing restlessly to and 
fro, when the door softly opened and Mrs. Hicks 
looked in upon him with a deprecating smile. As she 
lingered on the threshold, he stopped in the middle of 
the room and threw her a sharp glance over his 
shoulder.</p>
                  <p>“Is there anything you wish?” he questioned
irritably.</p>
                  <pb n="240"/>
                  <p>Shaking her head, she came slowly toward him 
and stood in her soiled wrapper and curl papers, 
where the gray light from the latticed window fell 
full upon her.</p>
                  <p>“It ain't nothin',” she answered hurriedly. “Nothin' 
except Jack's been tellin' me you're in trouble, Mr. 
Dan.”</p>
                  <p>“Then he has been telling you something that 
concerns nobody but myself,” he replied coolly, and 
continued his walking.</p>
                  <p>There was a nervous flutter of her wrapper, and 
she passed her knotted hand over her face.</p>
                  <p>“You are like yo' mother, Mr. Dan,” she said with 
an unexpectedness that brought him to a halt. “An' I 
was the last one to see her the night she went away. 
She came in here, po' thing, all shiverin' with the 
cold, an' she wouldn't set down but kep' walkin' up 
an' down, up an' down, jest like you've been doin' fur 
this last hour. Po' thing! Po' thing! I tried to make her 
take a sip of brandy, but she laughed an' said she 
was quite warm, with her teeth chatterin' fit to 
break—”</p>
                  <p>“You are very good, Mrs. Hicks,” interrupted 
Dan, in an affected drawl which steadied his voice,   
“but do you know, I'd really rather that you 
wouldn't.”</p>
                  <p>Her sallow face twitched and she looked wistfully 
up at him.</p>
                  <p>“It isn't that, Mr. Dan,” she went on slowly, “but 
I've had trouble myself, God knows, and when I 
think of that po' proud young lady, an' the way she 
went, I can't help sayin' what I feel—it won' stay 
back. So if you'll jest keep on here, an' give
<pb n="241"/>
up the stage drivin' an' wait twil the old gentleman 
comes round-Jack an' I'll do our best fur you—
we'll do our best, even if it ain't much.”</p>
                  <p>Her lips quivered, and as he watched her it seemed 
to him that a new meaning passed into her face—
something that made her look like Betty and his 
mother-that made all good women who had loved 
him look alike. For the moment he forgot her 
ugliness, and with the beginning of that keener 
insight into life which would come to him as he 
touched with humanity, he saw only the dignity with 
which suffering had endowed this plain and simple 
woman. The furrows upon her cheeks were no 
longer mere disfigurements; they raised her from the 
ordinary level of the ignorant and the ugly into some 
bond of sympathy with his dead mother.</p>
                  <p>“My dear Mrs. Hicks,” he stammered, abashed 
and reddening. “Why, I shall take a positive 
pleasure in driving the stage, I assure you.”</p>
                  <p>He crossed to the mirror and carefully brushed a 
stray lock of hair into place; then he took up his hat 
and gloves and turned toward the door. “I think it is 
waiting for me now,” he added lightly; a pleasant 
evening to you.“</p>
                  <p>But she stood straight before him and as he met 
her eyes his affected jauntiness dropped from him. 
With a boyish awkwardness he took her hand and 
held it for an instant as he looked at her. “My dear 
madam, you are a good woman,” he said, and went 
whistling down to take the stage.</p>
                  <p>Upon the porch he found Jack Hicks seated 
between a stout gentleman and a thin lady, who were 
to be the passengers to Hopeville; and as Dan 
	
<pb n="242"/>											
appeared the innkeeper started to his feet and swung 
open the door of the coach for the thin lady to pass 
inside. “You'll find it a pleasant ride, mum,” he 
heartily assured her. “I've often taken it myself an', 
rain or shine, thar's not a prettier road in all 
Virginny,” then he moved humbly back as Dan, 
carelessly drawing on his gloves, came down the 
steps.  “I hope we haven't hurried you, suh,” he 
stammered.</p>
                  <p>“Not a bit—not a bit,” returned Dan, affably, 
slipping on his overcoat, which Big Abel had run up 
to hold for him.</p>
                  <p>“You gwine git right soakin' wet, Marse Dan,” 
said Big Abel, anxiously.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I'll not melt,” responded Dan, and bowing to 
the thin lady he stepped upon the wheel and mounted 
lightly to the box.</p>
                  <p>“There's no end to this eternal drizzle,” he called 
down, as he tucked the waterproof robe about him 
and took up the reins.</p>
                  <p>Then, with a merry crack of the whip, the stage 
rolled through the gate and on its way. </p>
                  <p>As it turned into the road, a man on horseback 
came galloping from the direction of the town, and 
when he neared the tavern he stood up in his stirrups 
and shouted his piece of news.</p>
                  <p>“Thar was a raid on Harper's Ferry in the night,” 
he yelled hoarsely. “The arsenal has fallen, an'
they're armin' the damned niggers.”</p>

                  <head>XII</head>
                  <head>THE NIGHT OF FEAR</head>
                  <p>LATE in the afternoon, as the Governor neared the 
tavern, he was met by a messenger with the news; and at 
once turning his horse's head, he started back to 
Uplands. A dim fear, which had been with him since 
boyhood, seemed to take shape and meaning with the 
words; and in a lightning flash of understanding he 
knew that he had lived before through the horror of this 
moment. If his fathers had sinned, surely the shadow of 
their wrong had passed them by to fall the heavier upon 
their sons; for even as his blood rang in his ears, he saw 
a savage justice in the thing he feared—a recompense to 
natural laws in which the innocent should weigh as 
naught against the guilty.</p>
                  <p>A fine rain was falling; and as he went on, the end of 
a drizzling afternoon dwindled rapidly into night. 
Across the meadows he saw the lamps in scattered 
cottages twinkle brightly through the dusk which rolled 
like fog down from the mountains. The road he followed 
sagged between two gray hills into a narrow valley, and 
regaining its balance upon the farther side, stretched 
over a cattle pasture into the thick cover of the woods.</p>
                  <p>As he reached the summit of the first hill, he saw the 
Major's coach creeping slowly up the incline,
<pb n="244"/>
and heard the old gentleman scolding through the 
window at Congo on the box.</p>
                  <p>“My dear Major, home's the place for you,” he 
said as he drew rein. “Is it possible that the news 
hasn't reached you yet?”</p>
                  <p>Remembering Congo, he spoke cautiously, but the 
Major, in his anger, tossed discretion to the winds.</p>
                  <p>“Reached me?—bless my soul!—do you take me 
for a ground hog?” he cried, thrusting his red face 
through the window. “I met Tom Bickels four miles 
back, and the horses haven't drawn breath since. But 
it's what I expected all along—I was just telling 
Congo so—it all comes from the mistaken tolerance 
of black Republicans. Let me open my doors to them 
to-day, and they'll be tempting Congo to murder me 
in my bed to-morrow.”</p>
                  <p>“Go 'way f'om yer, Ole Marster,” protested 
Congo from the box, flicking at the harness with his 
long whip.</p>
                  <p>The Governor looked a little anxiously at the 
negro, and then shook his head impatiently. Though a 
less exacting master than the Major, he had not the 
same childlike trust in the slaves he owned.</p>
                  <p>“Shall you not turn back?” he asked, surprised.</p>
                  <p>“Champe's there,” responded the Major,  “so I 
came on for the particulars. A night in town isn't to 
my liking, but I can't sleep a wink until I hear a thing 
or two. You're going out, eh?”</p>
                  <p>“I'm riding home,” said the Governor, “it 
makes me uneasy to be away from Uplands.” He paused, 
hesitated an instant, and then broke out suddenly.  
“Good God, Major, what does it mean?”</p>
                  <pb n="245"/>
                  <p>The Major shook his head until his long white 
hair fell across his eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Mean, sir?” he thundered in a rage. “It means, 
I reckon, that those damned friends of yours have a 
mind to murder you. It means that after all your 
speech-making and your brotherly love, they're 
putting pitchforks into the hands of savages and 
loosening them upon you. Oh, you needn't mind 
Congo, Governor. Congo's heart's as white as mine.”</p>
                  <p>“Dat's so, Ole Marster,” put in Congo, 
approvingly.</p>
                  <p>The Governor was trembling as he leaned down 
from his saddle.</p>
                  <p>“We know nothing as yet, sir,” he began, “there 
must be some—”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, go on, go on,” cried the Major, striking the 
carriage window. “Keep up your speechmaking and 
your handshaking until your wife gets murdered in 
her bed—but, by God, sir, if Virginia doesn't secede 
after this, I'll secede without her!”</p>
                  <p>The coach moved on and the Governor, touching 
his horse with the whip, rode rapidly down the hill.</p>
                  <p>As he descended into the valley, a thick mist rolled 
over him and the road lost itself in the blur of the 
surrounding fields. Without slackening his pace, he 
lighted the lantern at his saddle-bow and turned up 
the collar of his coat about his ears. The fine rain 
was soaking through his clothes, but in the tension of 
his nerves he was oblivious of the weather. The sun 
might have risen overhead and he would not have 
known it.</p>
                  <pb n="246"/>
                  <p>With the coming down of the darkness a slow 
fear crept, like a physical chill, from head to foot. A 
visible danger he felt that he might meet face to face 
and conquer; but how could he stand against an 
enemy that crept upon him unawares?—against the 
large uncertainty, the utter ignorance of the depth or 
meaning of the outbreak, the knowledge of a hidden 
evil which might be even now brooding at his 
fireside?</p>
                  <p>A thousand hideous possibilities came toward him 
from out the stretch of the wood. The light of a 
distant window, seen through the thinned edge of the 
forest; the rustle of a small animal in the 
underbrush; the drop of a walnut on the wet leaves in 
the road; the very odours which rose from the moist 
earth and dripped from the leafless branches—all 
sent him faster on his way, with a sound within his 
ears that was like the drumming of his heart.</p>
                  <p>To quiet his nerves, he sought to bring before him 
a picture of the house at Uplands, of the calm white 
pillars and the lamplight shining from the door; but 
even as he looked the vision of a slave-war rushed 
between, and the old buried horrors of the 
Southampton uprising sprang suddenly to life and 
thronged about the image of his home. Yesterday 
those tales had been for him as colourless as history, 
as dry as dates; to-night, with this new fear at his 
heart, the past became as vivid as the present, and it 
seemed to him that beyond each lantern flash he saw 
a murdered woman, or an infant with its brains 
dashed out at its mother's breast. This was what he 
feared, for this was what the message
<pb n="247"/>
meant to him: “The slaves are armed and rising.”</p>
                  <p>And yet with it all, he felt that there was some wild 
justice in the thing he dreaded, in the revolt of, an enslaved 
and ignorant people, in the pitiable and ineffectual struggle 
for a freedom which would mean, in the beginning, but the 
power to go forth and kill. It was the recognition of this 
deeper pathos that made him hesitate to reproach even while 
his thoughts dwelt on the evils—that would, if the need 
came, send him fearless and gentle to the fight. For what he 
saw was that behind the new wrongs were the old ones, and 
that the sinners of to-day were, perhaps, the sinned against 
of yesterday.</p>
                  <p>When at last he came out into the turnpike, he had not 
the courage to look among the trees for the lights of 
Uplands; and for a while he rode with his eyes following 
the lantern flash as it ran onward over the wet ground. 
The small yellow circle held his gaze, and as if fascinated 
he watched it moving along the road, now shining on 
the silver grains in a ring of sand, now glancing back 
from the standing water in a wheelrut, and now 
illuminating a mossy stone or a weed upon the roadside. 
It was the one bright thing in a universe of blackness, 
until, as he came suddenly upon an elevation, the trees 
parted and he saw the windows of his home glowing 
upon the night. As he looked a great peace fell over him, 
and he rode on, thanking God.</p>
                  <p>When he turned into the drive, his past anxiety 
appeared to him to be ridiculous, and as he glanced 
from the clear lights in the great house to the chain
<pb n="248"/>
of lesser ones that stretched along the quarters, he 
laughed aloud in the first exhilaration of his relief. 
This at least was safe, God keep the others.</p>
                  <p>At his first call as he alighted before the portico, 
Hosea came running for his horse, and when he 
entered the house, the cheerful face of Uncle 
Shadrach looked out from the dining room.</p>
                  <p>“Hi! Marse Peyton, I 'lowed you wuz gwine ter 
spen' de night.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I had to get back, Shadrach,” replied the 
Governor. “No, I won't take any supper—you 
needn't bring it—but give me a glass of Burgundy, 
and then go to bed. Where is your mistress, by the 
way? Has she gone to her room?”</p>
                  <p>Uncle Shadrach brought the bottle of Burgundy 
from the cellaret and placed it upon the table.</p>
                  <p>“Naw, suh, Miss July she set out ter de quarters 
ter see atter Mahaley,” he returned. “Mahaley she's 
moughty bad off, but 'tain' no night fur Miss 
July—dat's w'at I tell 'er—one er dese yer spittin' 
nights ain' no night ter be out in.”</p>
                  <p>“You're right, Shadrach, you're right,” responded 
the Governor; and rising he drank the wine standing. 
“It isn't a fit night for her to be out, and I'll go after 
her at once.”</p>
                  <p>He took up his lantern, and as the old negro 
opened the doors before him, went out upon the back 
porch and down the steps.</p>
                  <p>From the steps a narrow path ran by the kitchen, 
and skirting the garden-wall, straggled through the 
orchard and past the house of the overseer to the big 
barn and the cabins in the quarters. There was a light 
from the barn door! and as he passed he heard
<pb n="249"/>
the sound of fiddles and the shuffling steps of the 
field hands in a noisy “game.” The words they sang 
floated out into the night, and with the squeaking of 
the fiddles followed him along his path.</p>
                  <p>When he reached the quarters, he went from door 
to door, asking for his wife. “Is this Mahaley's 
cabin?” he anxiously inquired, “and has your 
mistress gone by?”</p>
                  <p>In the first room an old negro woman sat on the 
hearth wrapping the hair of her grandchild, and she 
rose with a courtesy and a smile of welcome. At the 
question her face fell and she shook her head.</p>
                  <p>“Dis yer ain' Mahaley, Marster,” she replied. “En 
dis yer ain' Mahaley's cabin—caze Mahaley she ain' 
never set foot inside my do', en I ain' gwine set foot 
at her buryin'.” She spoke shrilly, moved by a hidden 
spite, but the Governor, without stopping, went on 
along the line of open doors. In one a field negro was 
roasting chestnuts in the embers of a log fire, and 
while waiting he had fallen asleep, with his head on 
his breast and his gnarled hands hanging between his 
knees. The firelight ran over him, and as he slept he 
stirred and muttered something in his dreams.</p>
                  <p>After the first glance, his master passed him by 
and moved on to the adjoining cabin. “Does 
Mahaley live here?” he asked again and yet again, 
until, suddenly, he had no need to put the question 
for from the last room he heard a low voice praying, 
and upon looking in saw his wife kneeling with her 
open Bible near the bedside.</p>
                  <pb n="250"/>
                  <p>With his hat in his hand, he stood within the 
shadow of the doorway and waited for the earnest 
voice to fall silent. Mahaley was dying, this he saw 
when his glance wandered to the shrunken figure 
beneath the patchwork quilt; and at the same instant 
he realized how small a part was his in Mahaley's life 
or death. He should hardly have known her had he 
met her last week in the corn field; and it was by 
chance only that he knew her now when she came to 
die.</p>
                  <p>As he stood there the burden of his responsibility 
weighed upon him like old age. Here in this scant 
cabin things so serious as birth and death showed in 
a pathetic bareness, stripped of all ceremonial 
trappings, as mere events in the orderly working out 
of natural laws—events as seasonable as the 
springing up and the cutting down of the corn. In 
these simple lives, so closely lived to the ground, 
grave things were sweetened by an unconscious 
humour which was of the soil itself; and even death 
lost something of its strangeness when it came like 
the grateful shadow which falls over a tired worker in 
the field.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler finished her prayer and rose from her 
knees; and as she did so two slave women, crouching 
in a corner by the fire, broke into loud moaning, 
which filled the little room with an animal and 
inarticulate sound of grief.</p>
                  <p>“Come away, Julia,” implored the Governor in a 
whisper, resisting an impulse to close his ears 
against the cry.</p>
                  <p>But his wife shook her head and spoke for a 
moment with the sick woman before she wrapped 
her
<pb n="251"/>
shawl about her and came out into the open air. 
Then she gave a sigh of relief, and, with her hand 
through her husband's arm, followed the path across 
the orchard.</p>
                  <p>“So you came home, after all,” she said. For a 
moment he made no response; then, glancing about 
him in the darkness, he spoke in a low voice, as if 
fearing the sound of his own words.</p>
                  <p>“Bad news brought me home, Julia,” he replied.   
“At the tavern they told me a message had come to 
Leicesterburg from Harper's Ferry. An attack was 
made on the arsenal at midnight, and, it may be but a 
rumour, my dear, it was feared that the slaves for 
miles around were armed for an uprising.”</p>
                  <p>His voice faltered, and he put out his hand to 
steady her, but she looked up at him and he saw her 
clear eyes shining in the gloom.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, poor creatures,” she murmured beneath her 
breath.</p>
                  <p>“Julia, Julia,” he said softly, and lifted the lantern 
that he might look into her face. As the light fell on 
her he knew that she was as much a mystery to him 
now as she had been twenty years ago on her 
wedding-day.</p>
                  <p>When they went into the house, he followed Uncle 
Shadrach about and carefully barred the windows, 
shooting bolts which were rusted from disuse. After 
the old negro had gone out he examined the locks 
again; and then going into the hall took down a bird 
gun and an army pistol from their places on the rack. 
These he loaded and laid near at hand beside the 
books upon his table.</p>
                  <pb n="252"/>
                  <p>There was no sleep for him that night, and until dawn 
he sat, watchful, in his chair, or moved softly from 
window to window, looking for a torch upon the road 
and listening for the sound of approaching steps.</p>
               </div>
               <pb n="253"/>
               <div org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                  <head>XIII</head>
                  <head>CRABBED AGE AND CALLOW YOUTH</head>
                  <p>WITH the morning came trustier tidings. The slaves 
had taken no part in the attack, the weapons had 
dropped from the few dark hands into which they had 
been given, and while the shots that might bring them 
freedom yet rang at Harper's Ferry, the negroes 
themselves went with cheerful faces to their work, or 
looked up, singing, from their labours in the field. In 
the green valley, set amid blue mountains, they 
moved quietly back and forth, raking the wind-drifts 
of fallen leaves, or ploughing the rich earth for the 
autumn sowing of the grain.</p>
                  <p>As the Governor was sitting down to breakfast, the 
Lightfoot coach rolled up to the portico, and the 
Major stepped down to deliver himself of his 
garnered news. He was in no pleasant humour, for he 
had met Dan face to face that morning as he passed 
the tavern, and as if this were not sufficient to try the 
patience of an irascible old gentleman, a spasm of 
gout had seized him as he made ready to descend.</p>
                  <p>But at the sight of Mrs. Ambler, he trod valiantly 
upon his gouty toe, and screwed his features into his 
blandest smile—an effort which drew so heavily 
upon the source of his good-nature, that he 
<pb n="254"/>
arrived at Chericoke an hour later in what was 
known to Betty as “a purple rage.”</p>
                  <p>“You know I have always warned you, Molly,” 
was his first offensive thrust as he entered Mrs. 
Lightfoot's chamber, “that your taste for trash 
would be the ruin of the family. It has ruined your 
daughter, and now it is ruining your grandson. Well, 
well, you can't say that it is for lack of warning.”</p>
                  <p>From the centre of her tester bed, the old lady 
calmly regarded him. “I told you to bring back the 
boy, Mr. Lightfoot,” she returned. “You surely saw 
him in town, didn't you?” </p>
                  <p>“Oh, yes, I saw him,” replied the Major, loosening 
his high black stock. “But where do you suppose I 
saw him, ma'am? and how? Why, the young 
scapegrace has actually gone and hired himself out 
as a stagedriver—a common stagedriver. And, bless 
my soul, he had the audacity to tip his hat to me from 
the box—from the box with the reins in his hand, 
ma'am!”</p>
                  <p>“What stage, Mr. Lightfoot?” inquired his wife, 
with an eye for particulars.  </p>
                  <p>“Oh, I wash my hands of him,” pursued the 
Major, waving her question aside. “I wash my 
hands of him, and that's the end of it. In my 
day, the young were supposed to show some respect 
for their elders, and every calf wasn't of the 
opinion that he could bellow like a bull—but 
things are changed now, and I wash my hands of it 
all. A more ungrateful family, I am willing to 
maintain, no man was ever blessed with—which comes, 
I reckon, from sparing the rod and spoiling the
<pb n="255"/>
child—but I'm sure I don't see how it is that it is 
always your temper that gets inherited.”</p>
                  <p>The personal note fell unheeded upon his wife's 
ears.</p>
                  <p>“You don't mean to tell me that you came away and 
left the boy sitting on the box of a stagecoach?” she 
demanded sharply.</p>
                  <p>“Would you have me claim a stagedriver as a 
grandson?” retorted the Major, “because I may as 
well say now, ma'am, that there are some things I'll 
not stoop to. Why, I'd as fief have an uncle who was 
a chimney sweep.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot turned uneasily in bed. “It means, 
I suppose, that I shall have to get up and go after 
him,” she remarked, “and you yourself heard the 
doctor tell me not to move out of bed for a week. It 
does seem to me, Mr. Lightfoot, that you might show 
some consideration for my state of health. Do ride in 
this afternoon, and tell Dan that I say he must 
behave himself properly.”</p>
                  <p>But the Major turned upon her the terrific 
countenance she had last seen on Jane's wedding 
day, and she fell silent from sheer inability to utter a 
protest befitting the occasion.</p>
                  <p>“If that stagedriver enters my house, I leave it, 
ma'am,” thundered the old gentleman, with a stamp 
of his gouty foot. “You may choose between us, if 
you like,—I have never interfered with your 
fancies—but, by God, if you bring him inside my 
doors I—I will horsewhip him, madam,” and he went 
limping out into the hall.</p>
                  <p>On the stair he met Betty, who looked at him with 
pleading eyes, but fled, affrighted before the
<pb n="256"/>
colour of his wrath; and in his library he found 
Champe reading his favourite volume of Mr. Addison.</p>
                  <p>“I hope you aren't scratching up my books, sir,” he 
observed, eying the pencil in his great-nephew's hand.</p>
                  <p>Champe looked at him with his cool glance, and rose 
leisurely to his feet. “Why, I'd as soon think of 
scrawling over Aunt Emmeline's window pane,” he 
returned pleasantly, and added, “I hope you had a 
successful trip, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“I got a lukewarm supper and a cold breakfast,” 
replied the Major irritably, “and I heard that the 
Marines had those Kansas raiders entrapped like rats in 
the arsenal, if that is what you mean.”</p>
                  <p>“No, I wasn't thinking of that,” replied Champe, as 
quietly as before. “I came home to find out about Dan, 
you know, and I hoped you went into town to look him 
up.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I didn't, sir,” declared the Major, “and 
as for that scamp—I have as much knowledge of his 
whereabouts as I care for.—Do you know, sir,” he broke 
out fiercely, “that he has taken to driving a common 
stage?”</p>
                  <p>Champe was sharpening his pencil, and he did not 
look up as he answered. “Then the sooner he leaves off 
the better, eh, sir?” he inquired.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, there's your everlasting wrangling!” 
exclaimed the Major with a hopeless gesture. 
“You catch it from Molly, I reckon, and between 
you, you'll drive me into dotage yet. Always arguing! 
Never any peace. Why, I believe if I were to take it 
into my head to remark that white is white, you
<pb n="257"/>
would both be setting out to convince me that it is 
black. I tell you now, sir, that the sooner you curb 
that tendency of yours, the better it will be.”</p>
                  <p>“Aren't we rather straying from the point?” 
interposed Champe half angrily.</p>
                  <p>“There it is again,” gasped the Major.</p>
                  <p>The knife slipped in Champe's hand and scratched 
his finger. “Surely you don't intend to leave Dan to 
knock about for himself much longer?” he said 
coolly. “If you do, sir, I don't mind saying that I 
think it is a damn shame.”</p>
                  <p>“How dare you use such language in my 
presence?” roared the old gentleman, growing purple 
to the neck. “Have you, also, been fighting for 
barmaids and taking up with gaol-birds? It is what I 
have to expect, I suppose, and I may as well 
accustom my ears to profanity; but damn you, sir, 
you must learn some decency;” and going into the 
hall he shouted to Congo to bring him a julep.</p>
                  <p>Champe said nothing more; and when the julep 
appeared on a silver tray, he left the room and went 
upstairs to where Betty was waiting. “He's awful, 
there's no use mincing words, he's simply awful,” he 
remarked in an exhausted voice.</p>
                  <p>“But what does he say? tell me,” questioned 
Betty, as she moved to a little peaked window which 
overlooked the lawn.</p>
                  <p>“What doesn't he say?” groaned Champe with his 
eyes upon her as she stood relieved against the 
greenish panes of glass.</p>
                  <p>“Do you think I might speak to him?” she 
persisted eagerly.</p>
                  <pb n="258"/>
                  <p>“My dear girl, do you want to have your head 
bitten off for your pains? His temper is positively 
tremendous. By Jove, I didn't know he had it in him 
after all these years; I thought he had worn it out on 
dear Aunt Molly. And Beau, by the way, isn't going 
to be the only one to suffer for his daring, which 
makes me wish that he had chosen to embrace the 
saintly instead of the heroic virtues. I confess that I 
could find it in my heart to prefer less of David and 
more of Job.”</p>
                  <p>“How can you?” remonstrated Betty. She 
pressed her hands together and looked wistfully up at 
him. “But what are you going to do about it?” she 
demanded.</p>
                  <p>For a moment his eyes dwelt on her.</p>
                  <p>“Betty, Betty, how you care!” he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“Care?” she laughed impatiently. “Oh, I care, 
but what good does that do?”</p>
                  <p>“Would you care as much for me, I wonder?” 
She smiled up at him and shook her head.</p>
                  <p>“No, I shouldn't, Champe,” she answered 
honestly.</p>
                  <p>He turned his gaze away from her, and looked 
through the dim old window panes out upon the 
clustered elm boughs.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'll do this much,” he said in a cheerful 
voice. “I'll ride to the tavern this morning and find 
out how the land lies there. I'll see Beau, and I'll do 
my best for him, and for you, Betty.” She put out her 
hand and touched his arm. “Dear Champe!” she 
exclaimed impulsively.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I dare say,” he scoffed, “but is there any 
message?”</p>
                  <pb n="259"/>
                  <p>“Tell him to come back,” she answered, “to come 
back now, or when he will.”</p>
                  <p>“Or when he will,” he repeated smiling, and went 
down to order his horse.</p>
                  <p>At the tavern he found Jack Hicks and a 
neighbouring farmer or two, seated upon the porch 
discussing the raid upon Harper's Ferry. They would 
have drawn him into the talk, but he asked at once 
for Dan, and upon learning the room in which he 
lodged, ran up the narrow stair and rapped upon the 
door. Then, without waiting for a response, he burst 
into the room with outstretched hand. “Why, they've 
put you into a tenpin alley,” were his words of 
greeting.</p>
                  <p>With a laugh Dan sprang up from his chair 
beside the window. “What on earth are you doing 
here, old man?” he asked.</p>
                  <p>“Well, just at present I'm trying to pull you out of 
the hole you've stumbled into. I say, in the name of 
all that's rational, why did you allow yourself to get 
into such a scrape?”</p>
                  <p>Dan sat down again and motioned to a 
split-bottomed chair he had used for a footstool.</p>
                  <p>“There's no use going into that,” he replied 
frowning, “I raised the row and I'm ready to bear 
the consequences.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, that's the point, my dear fellow; Aunt Molly 
and I have been bearing them all the morning.”</p>
                  <p>“Of course, I'm sorry for that, but I may as well 
tell you now that things are settled so far as I am 
concerned. I've been kicked out and I wouldn't go 
back again if they came for me in a golden chariot.”</p>
                  <pb n="260"/>
                  <p>“I hardly think that's likely to happen,” was 
Champe's cheerful rejoinder. “The old gentleman 
has had his temper touched, as, I dare say, you're 
aware, and, as ill-luck would have it, he saw you on 
the stagecoach this morning. My dear Beau, you 
ought to have crawled under the box.”</p>
                  <p>“Nonsense!” protested Dan, “it's no concern of 
his.” He turned his flushed boyish face angrily 
away.</p>
                  <p>Champe looked at him steadily with a twinkle in 
his eyes. “Well, I hope your independence will come 
buttered,” he remarked. “I doubt if you will find  the 
taste of dry bread to your liking. By the way, do you 
intend to enter Jack Hicks's household?”</p>
                  <p>“For a fortnight, perhaps. I've written to Judge 
Compton, and if he'll take me into his office, I shall 
study law.”</p>
                  <p>Champe gave a long whistle. “I should have 
supposed that your taste would be for tailoring,” he 
observed, “your genius for the fashions is 
immense.”</p>
                  <p>“I hope to cultivate that also,” said Dan, smiling, 
as he glanced at his coat.</p>
                  <p>“What? on bread and cheese and Blackstone?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Blackstone! I never heard he wasn't a 
well-dressed old chap.”</p>
                  <p>“At least you'll take half my allowance?”</p>
                  <p>Dan shook his head. “Not a cent—not a copper 
cent.”</p>
                  <p>“But how will you live, man?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, somehow,” he laughed carelessly. “I'll live 
somehow.”</p>
                  <pb n="261"/>
                  <p>“It's rather a shame, you know,” responded 
Champe, “but there's one thing of which I am very 
sure—the old gentleman will come round. We'll 
make him do it, Aunt Molly and I—and Betty.”</p>
                  <p>Dan started.</p>
                  <p>“Betty sent you a message, by the way,” pursued 
Champe, looking through the window. “It was 
something about coming home; she says you are to 
come home now—or when you will.” He rose and 
took up his hat and riding-whip.</p>
                  <p>“Or when I will,” said Dan, rising also. “Tell 
her—no, don't tell her anything—what's the use?”</p>
                  <p>“She doesn't need telling,” responded Champe, 
going toward the door; and he added as they went 
together down the stair, “She always understands 
without words, somehow.”</p>
                  <p>Dan followed him into the yard, and watched 
him, from under the oaks beside the empty 
stagecoach, as he mounted and rode away.</p>
                  <p>“For heaven's sake, remember my warning,” said 
Champe, turning in the saddle, “and don't insist 
upon eating dry bread if you're offered butter.”</p>
                  <p>“And you will look after Aunt Molly and Betty?” 
Dan rejoined.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I'll look after them,” replied the other 
lightly, and rode off at an amble.</p>
                  <p>Dan looked after the horse and rider until they 
passed slowly out of sight; then, coming back to the 
porch, he sat down among the farmers, and listened, 
abstractedly, to the drawling voice of Jack Hicks.</p>
                  <p>When Champe reached Chericoke, he saw Betty
<pb n="262"/>											
looking for him from Aunt Emmeline's window seat; 
and as he dismounted, she ran out and joined him 
upon the steps.</p>
                  <p>“And you saw him?” she asked breathlessly.</p>
                  <p>“It was pleasant to think that you came to meet 
me for my own sake,” he returned; and at her impatient 
gesture, caught her hand and looked into. her eyes.</p>
                  <p>“I saw him, my dear,” he said, “and he was in a 
temper that would have proved his descent had he 
been lost in infancy.”</p>
                  <p>She eagerly questioned him, and he answered with 
forbearing amusement. “Is that all?” she asked at 
last, and when he nodded, smiling, she went up to 
Mrs. Lightfoot's bedside and besought her “to make 
the Major listen to reason.”</p>
                  <p>“He never listened to it in his life, my child,” 
the old lady replied, “and I think it is hardly to be 
expected of him that he should begin at his present 
age.” Then she gathered, bit by bit, the news that 
Champe had brought, and ended by remarking that   
“the ways of men and boys were past finding out.”</p>
                  <p>“Do you think the Major will ever forgive him?” 
asked Betty, hopelessly.</p>
                  <p>“He never forgave poor Jane,” answered Mrs. 
Lightfoot, her voice breaking at the mention of her 
daughter. “But whether he forgives him or not, the 
silly boy must be made to come home; and as soon 
as I am out of this bed, I must get into the coach and 
drive to that God-forsaken tavern. After ten years, 
nothing will content them, I suppose, but that I 
should jolt my bones to pieces.”</p>
                  <pb n="263"/>
                  <p>Betty looked at her anxiously. “When will you be 
up?” she inquired, flushing, as the old lady's sharp 
eyes pierced her through.</p>
                  <p>“I really think, my dear, that you are less 
sensible than I took you to be,” returned Mrs. Lightfoot. 
“It was very foolish of you to allow yourself to 
take a fancy to Dan. You should have insisted upon 
preferring Champe, as I cautioned you to do. In 
entering into marriage it is always well to consider 
first, family connections and secondly, personal 
disposition; and in both of these particulars there is 
no fault to be found with Champe. His mother was a 
Randolph, my child, which is greatly to his credit. As 
for Dan, I fear he will make anything but a safe 
husband.”</p>
                  <p>“Safe!” exclaimed Betty indignantly, “did you 
marry the Major because he was ‘safe,’ I wonder?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot accepted the rebuke with 
meekness.</p>
                  <p>“Had I done so, I should certainly have proved 
myself to be a fool,” she returned with grim humour, 
“but since you have fully decided that you prefer to 
be miserable, I shall take you with me tomorrow 
when I go for Dan.”</p>
                  <p>But on the morrow the old lady did not leave her 
bed, and the doctor, who came with his saddlebags 
from Leicesterburg, glanced her over and ordered  
“perfect repose of mind and body” before he drank 
his julep and rode away.</p>
                  <p>“Perfect repose, indeed!” scoffed his patient, 
from behind her curtains, when the visit was over.  
“Why, the idiot might as well have ordered me a 
mustard plaster. If he thinks there's any ' repose'
<pb n="264"/>											
in being married to Mr. Lightfoot, I'd be very glad to 
have him try it for a week.”</p>
                  <p>Betty made no response, for her throat was 
strained and aching; but in a moment Mrs. Lightfoot 
called her to her bedside and patted her upon the 
arm.</p>
                  <p>“We'll go next week, child,” she said gently.        
“When you have been married as long as I have 
been, you will know that a week the more or the less 
of a man's society makes very little difference in the 
long run.”</p>
                  <p>And the next week they went. On a ripe October 
day, when the earth was all red and gold, the coach 
was brought out into the drive, and Mrs. Lightfoot 
came down, leaning upon Champe and Betty.</p>
                  <p>The Major was reading his Horace in the library, 
and though he heard the new pair of roans pawing on 
the gravel, he gave no sign of displeasure. His age 
had oppressed him in the last few days, and he 
carried stains, like spilled wine, on his cheeks. He 
could not ease his swollen heart by outbursts of 
anger, and the sensitiveness of his temper warned off 
the sympathy which he was too proud to unbend and 
seek. So he sat and stared at the unturned Latin 
page, and the hand he raised to his throat trembled 
slightly in the air.</p>
                  <p>Outside, Betty, in her most becoming bonnet, with 
her blue barege shawl over her soft white gown, 
wrapped Mrs. Lightfoot in woollen robes, and 
fluttered nervously when the old lady remembered 
that she had left, her spectacles behind.</p>
                  <p>“I brought the empty case; here it is, my dear,”
<pb n="265"/>											
she said, offering it to the girl. “Surely you don't 
intend to take me off without my glasses?”</p>
                  <p>Mitty was sent upstairs on a search for them, and 
in her absence her mistress suddenly decided that she 
needed an extra wrap. “The little white nuby in my 
top drawer, Betty—I felt a chill striking the back of 
my neck.”</p>
                  <p>Betty threw her armful of robes into the coach, and 
ran hurriedly up to the old lady's room, coming 
down, in a moment, with the spectacles in one hand 
and the little white shawl in the other.</p>
                  <p>“Now, we must really start, Congo,” she called, 
as she sat down beside Mrs. Lightfoot, and when the 
coach rolled along the drive, she leaned out and 
kissed her hand to Champe upon the steps.</p>
                  <p>“It is a heavenly day,” she said with a sigh of 
happiness. “Oh, isn't it too good to be real 
weather?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot did not answer, for she was busily 
examining the contents of her black silk bag.</p>
                  <p>“Stop Congo, Betty,” she exclaimed, after a hasty 
search. “I have forgotten my handkerchief; I 
sprinkled it with camphor and left it on the bureau. 
Tell him to go back at once.”</p>
                  <p>“Take mine, take mine!” cried the girl, pressing it 
upon her; and then turning her back upon the old 
lady, she leaned from the window and looked over 
the valley filled with sunshine.</p>
                  <p>The whip cracked, the fat roans kicked the 
dust, and on they went merrily down the branch road 
into the turnpike; past Aunt Ailsey's cabin, past 
the wild cherry tree, where the blue sky shone 
through naked twigs; down the long curve, past
<pb n="266"/>									
the tuft of cedars—and still the turnpike swept wide 
and white, into the distance, dividing gay fields 
dotted with browsing cattle. At Uplands Betty 
caught a glimpse of Aunt Lydia between the silver 
poplars, and called joyfully from the window; but 
the words were lost in the rattling of the wheels; and 
as she lay back in her corner, Uplands was left 
behind, and in a little while they passed into the 
tavern road and went on beneath the shade of 
interlacing branches.</p>
                  <p>Underfoot the ground was russet, and through the 
misty woods she saw the leaves still falling against a 
dim blue perspective. The sunshine struck in arrows 
across the way, and far ahead, at the end of the long 
vista, there was golden space.</p>
                  <p>With the ten miles behind them, they came to the 
tavern in the early afternoon, and, as a small 
tow-headed boy swung open the gate, the coach 
rolled into the yard and drew up before the steps.</p>
                  <p>Jack Hicks started from his seat, and throwing his 
pipe aside, came hurriedly to the wheels, but before 
he laid his hand upon the door, Betty opened it and 
sprang lightly to the ground, her face radiant in the 
shadow of her bonnet.</p>
                  <p>“Let me speak, child,” called Mrs. Lightfoot after 
her, adding, with courteous condescension, “How are 
you, Mr. Hicks? Will you go up at once and tell my 
grandson to pack his things and come straight down. 
As soon as the horses are rested we must start back 
again.”</p>
                  <p>With visible perturbation Jack looked from the
<pb n="267"/>									
coach to the tavern door, and stood awkwardly 
scraping his feet upon the road.</p>
                  <p>“I—I'll go up with all the pleasure in life, 
mum,” he stammered; “but I don't reckon thar's no use—
he—he's gone.”</p>
                  <p>“Gone?” cried the aghast old lady; and Betty 
rested her hand upon the wheel.</p>
                  <p>“Big Abel, he's gone, too,” went on Jack, gaining 
courage from the accustomed sound of his own 
drawl. “Mr. Dan tried his best to git away without 
him—but Lord, Lord, the sense that nigger's got. 
Why, his marster might as well have tried to give his 
own skin the slip—”</p>
                  <p>“Where did they go?” sharply put in the old lady.  
“Don't mumble your words, speak plainly, if you 
please.”</p>
                  <p>“He wouldn't tell me, mum; I axed him, but he 
wouldn't say. A letter came last night, and this 
morning at sunup they were off—Mr. Dan in front, 
and Big Abel behind with the bundle on his shoulder. 
They walked to Leicestersburg, that's all I know, 
mum.”</p>
                  <p>“Let me get inside,” said Betty, quickly. Her face 
had gone white, but she thanked Jack when he picked 
up the shawl she dropped, and went steadily into the 
coach. “We may as well go back,” she added with a 
little laugh.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot threw an anxious look into her 
face.</p>
                  <p>“We must consider the horses, my dear,” she 
responded. “Mr. Hicks, will you see that the horses 
are well fed and watered. Let them take their time.”</p>
                  <pb n="268"/>
                  <p>“Oh, I forgot the horses,” returned Betty       
apologetically, and patiently sat down with her arm 
leaning in the window. There was a smile on her 
lips, and she stared with bright eyes at the oak trees 
and the children playing among the acorns.</p>

                  <head>THE HUSH BEFORE THE STORM</head>
                  <p>THE autumn crept into winter; the winter went by, 
short and fitful, and the spring unfolded slowly. 
With the milder weather the mud dried in the roads, 
and the Major and the Governor went daily into 
Leicesterburg. The younger man had carried his 
oratory and his influence into the larger cities of the 
state, and he had come home, at the end of a month 
of speech-making, in a fervour of almost boyish 
enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>“I pledge my word for it, Julia,” he had declared 
to his wife, “it will take more than a Republican 
President to sever Virginia from the Union- in fact, 
I'm inclined to think that it will take a thunderbolt 
from heaven, or the Major for a despot!”</p>
                  <p>When, as the spring went on, men came from the 
political turmoil to ask for his advice, he repeated 
the words with a conviction that was in itself a ring 
of emphasis.</p>
                  <p>“We are in the Union, gentlemen, for better or for 
worse”—and of all the guests who drank his 
Madeira under the pleasant shade of his maples, only 
the Major found voice to raise a protest.</p>
                  <p>“We'll learn, sir, we'll live and learn,” interposed 
the old gentleman.</p>
                  <pb n="270"/>
                  <p>“Let us hope we shall live easily,” said the 
doctor, lifting his glass.</p>
                  <p>“And learn wisdom,” added the rector, with a 
chuckle.</p>
                  <p>Through the spring and summer they rode leisurely 
back and forth, bringing bundles of newspapers 
when they came, and taking away with them a 
memory of the broad white portico and the mellow 
wine.</p>
                  <p>The Major took a spasmodic part in the 
discussions of peace or war, sitting sometimes in a 
moody silence, and flaring up, like an exhausted 
candle, at the news of an abolition outbreak. In his 
heart he regarded the state of peace as a mean and 
beggarly condition and the sure resort of bloodless 
cowards; but even a prospect of the inspiring dash of 
war could not elicit so much as the semblance of his 
old ardour. His smile flashed but seldom over his 
harsh features—it needed indeed the presence of 
Mrs. Ambler or of Betty to bring it forth -and his 
erect figure had given way in the chest, as if a 
strong wind bent him forward when he walked.</p>
                  <p>“He has grown to be an old man,” his neighbours 
said pityingly; and it is true that the weight of his 
years had fallen upon him in a night—as if he had gone 
to bed in a hale old age, with the sap of youth in his 
veins, to awaken with bleared eyes and a trembling hand. 
Since the day of his wife's return urn from the tavern, 
when he had peered from his hiding-place in his library 
window, he had not mentioned his grandson by name; and yet 
the thought of him seemed forever lying beneath his captious
<pb n="271"/>                                                                              
exclamations. He pricked nervously at the subject, 
made roundabout allusions to the base ingratitude 
from which he suffered; and the desertion of Big 
Abel had damned for him the whole faithful race 
from which the offender sprang.</p>
                  <p>“They are all alike,” he sweepingly declared.       
“There is not a trustworthy one among them. They'll 
eat my bread and steal my chickens, and then run off 
with the first scapegrace that gives them a chance.”</p>
                  <p>“I think Big Abel did just right,” said Betty, 
fearlessly.</p>
                  <p>The old gentleman squared himself to fix her with 
his weak red eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you're just the same,” he returned pettishly, 
“just the same.”</p>
                  <p>“But I don't steal your chickens, sir,” protested the 
girl, laughing.</p>
                  <p>The Major grunted and looked down at her in 
angry silence; then his face relaxed and a frosty 
smile played about his lips.</p>
                  <p>“You are young, my child,” he replied, in a kind 
of austere sadness, “and youth is always an enemy 
to the old—to the old,” he repeated quietly, and 
looked at his wrinkled hand.</p>
                  <p>But in the excitement of the next autumn, he 
showed for a time a revival of his flagging spirit. 
When the elections came he followed them with an 
absorption that had in it all the violence of a 
mental malady. The four possible Presidents that 
stood before the people were drawn for him in bold 
lines of black and white—the outward and visible 
distinction between, on the one side, the three 
<pb n="272"/>											
“adventurers” whom he heartily opposed, and, on 
the other, the “Kentucky gentleman,” for whom he 
as heartily voted. There was no wavering in his 
convictions—no uncertainty; he was troubled by no 
delicate shades of indecision. What he believed, and 
that alone, was God-given right; what he did not 
believe, with all things pertaining to it, was equally 
God-forsaken error.</p>
                  <p>Toward the Governor, when the people's choice 
was known, he displayed a resentment that was 
almost touching in its simplicity.</p>
                  <p>“There's a man who would tear the last rag of 
honour from the Old Dominion,” he remarked, in 
speaking of his absent neighbour.</p>
                  <p>“Ah, Major,” sighed the rector, for it was upon 
one of his weekly visits, “what course would you 
have us gird our loins to pursue?”</p>
                  <p>“Course?” promptly retorted the Major. “Why, 
the course of courage, sir.”</p>
                  <p>The rector shook his great head. “My dear friend, 
I fear you recognize the virtue only when she carries 
the battle-axe,” he observed.</p>
                  <p>For a moment the Major glared at him; then, 
restrained by his inherited reverence for the pulpit, 
he yielded the point with the soothing 
acknowledgment that he was always “willing to 
make due allowance for ministers of the gospel.”</p>
                  <p>“My dear sir,” gasped Mr. Blake, as his 
jaw dropped. His face showed plainly that so 
professional an allowance was exactly what he did 
not take to be his due; but he let sleeping dangers lie, 
and it was not until a fortnight later, when he rode 
out with a copy of the <hi rend="italics">Charleston Mercury</hi> and the news
<pb n="273"/>											
of the secession of South Carolina, that he found 
the daring to begin a direct approach.</p>
                  <p>It was a cold, bright evening in December, and 
the Major unfolded the paper and read it by the 
firelight, which glimmered redly on the frosted 
window panes. When he had finished, he looked 
over the fluttering sheet into the pale face of the 
rector, and waited breathlessly for the first decisive 
words.</p>
                  <p>“May she depart in peace,” said the minister, in a 
low voice.</p>
                  <p>The old gentleman drew a long breath, and, in the 
cheerful glow, the other, looking at him, saw his 
weak red eyes fill with tears. Then he took out his 
handkerchief, shook it from its folds, and loudly 
blew his nose.</p>
                  <p>“It was the Union our fathers made, Mr. Blake,” 
he said.</p>
                  <p>“And the Union you fought for, Major,” returned 
the rector.</p>
                  <p>“In two wars, sir,” he glanced down at his arm as 
if he half expected to see a wound, “and I shall 
never fight for another,” he added with a sigh. “My 
fighting days are over.”</p>
                  <p>They were both silent, and the logs merrily 
crackled on the great brass andirons, while the 
flames went singing up the chimney. A glass of 
Burgundy was at the rector's hand, and he lifted it 
from the silver tray and sipped it as he waited. At 
last the old man spoke, bending forward from his 
station upon the hearth-rug.</p>
                  <p>“You haven't seen Peyton Ambler, I reckon?”</p>
                  <p>“I passed him coming out of town and he was
<pb n="274"/>											
trembling like a leaf,” replied the rector. “He looks 
badly, by the way. I must remember to tell the 
doctor he needs building up.”</p>
                  <p>“He didn't speak about this, eh?”</p>
                  <p>“About South Carolina? Oh, yes, he spoke, sir. It 
happened that Jack Powell came up with him when I 
did—the boy was cheering with all his might, and I 
heard him ask the Governor if he questioned the right 
of the state to secede?”</p>
                  <p>“And Peyton said, sir?” The Major leaned 
eagerly toward him.</p>
                  <p>“He said,” pursued the rector, laughing softly.      
“‘God forbid, my boy, that I should question the 
right of any man or any country to pursue folly.’”</p>
                  <p>“Folly!” cried the Major, sharply, firing at the 
first sign of opposition. “It was a brave deed, sir, a 
brave deed—and I—yes, I envy the honour for 
Virginia. And as for Peyton Ambler, it is my belief 
that it is he who has sapped the courage of the state. 
Why, my honest opinion is that there are not fifty 
men in Virginia with the spirit to secede—and they 
are women.”</p>
                  <p>The rector laughed and tapped his wine-glass.</p>
                  <p>“You mustn't let that reach Mrs. Lightfoot's ears, 
Major,” he cautioned, “for I happen to know that 
she prides herself upon being what the papers call a  
‘skulker.’ “He stopped and rose heavily to his feet, 
for, at this point, the door was opened by Cupid and 
the old lady rustled stiffly into the room.</p>
                  <p>“I came down to tell you, Mr. Lightfoot, that you 
really must not allow yourself to become excited,”  
she explained, when the rector had comfortably 
settled her upon the hearth-rug.</p>
                  <pb n="275"/>
                  <p>“Pish! tush! my dear, there's not a cooler man in 
Virginia,” replied the Major, frowning; but for the rest 
of the evening he brooded in troubled silence in his easy 
chair.</p>
                  <p>In February, a week after a convention of the people 
was called at Richmond, the old gentleman surrendered 
to a sharp siege of the gout, and through the long winter 
days he sat, red and querulous, before the library fire, 
with his bandaged foot upon the ottoman that wore Aunt 
Emmeline's wedding dress. From Leicesterburg a 
stanch Union man had gone to the convention; and the 
Major still resented the selection of his neighbours as 
bitterly as if it were an affront to aspirations of his own.</p>
                  <p>“Dick Powell!  Pooh! he's another Peyton Ambler,” 
he remarked testily, “and on my word there're too many 
of his kind—too many of his kind. What we lack, sir, is 
men of spirit.”</p>
                  <p>When his friends came now he shot his angry 
questions, like bullets, from the fireside. “Haven't they 
done anything yet, eh? How much longer do you reckon 
that roomful of old women will gabble in Richmond? 
Why, we might as well put a flock of sheep to decide 
upon a measure!”</p>
                  <p>But the “roomful of old women” would not be 
hurried, and the Major grew almost hoarse with 
scolding. For more than two months, while North and 
South barked at each other across her borders, Virginia 
patiently and fruitlessly worked for peace; and for more 
than two months the Major writhed a prisoner upon the 
hearth.</p>
                  <p>With the coming of the spring his health mended,
<pb n="276"/>											
and on an April morning, when Betty and the 
Governor drove over for a quiet chat, they found him 
limping painfully up and down the drive with the 
help of a great gold-knobbed walking-stick.</p>
                  <p>He greeted them cordially, and limped after them 
into the library where Mrs. Lightfoot sat knitting. 
While he slowly settled his foot, in its loose “carpet” 
slipper, upon the ottoman, he began a rambling story 
of the War of 1812, recalling with relish a time when 
rations grew scant in camp, and “Will Bolling and 
myself set out to scour the country.” His thoughts 
had made a quick spring backward, and in the midst 
of events that fired the Governor's blood, he could 
still fondly dwell upon the battles of his youth.</p>
                  <p>The younger man, facing him upon the hearth, 
listened with his patient courtesy, and put in a 
sympathetic word at intervals. No personal anxiety 
could cloud his comely face, nor any grievance of his 
own sharpen the edge of his peculiar suavity. It was 
only when he rose to go that he voiced, for a single 
instant, his recognition of the general danger, and 
replied to the Major's inquiry about his health with 
the remark, “Ah, grave times make grave faces, sir.”</p>
                  <p>Then he bowed over Mrs. Lightfoot's hand, and 
with his arm about Betty went out to the carriage.</p>
                  <p>“The Major's an old man, daughter,” he observed, 
as they rolled rapidly back to Uplands.</p>
                  <p>“You mean he has broken—” said Betty, and 
stopped short.</p>
                  <p>“Since Dan went away.” As the Governor completed
	
<pb n="277"/>											
her sentence, he turned and looked thoughtfully into her 
face. “It's hard to judge the young, my dear, but—” he 
broke off as Betty had done, and added after a pause,  
“I wonder where he is now?”</p>
                  <p>Betty raised her eyes and met his look. “I do not 
know,” she answered, “but I do know that he will come 
back;” and the Governor, being wise in his generation, 
said nothing more.</p>
                  <p>That afternoon he went down into the country to 
inspect a decayed plantation which had come into his 
hands, and returning two days later, he rode into 
Leicesterburg and up to the steps of the little post-office, 
where, as usual, the neighbouring farmers lounged 
while they waited for an expected despatch, or discussed 
the midday mail with each newcomer. It was April 
weather, and the afternoon sunshine, having scattered 
the loose clouds in the west, slanted brightly down upon 
the dusty street, the little whitewashed building, and the 
locust tree in full bloom before the porch.</p>
                  <p>When he had dismounted, the Governor tied his 
horse to the long white pole, raised for that purpose 
along the sidewalk, and went slowly up the steps, 
shaking a dozen outstretched hands before he reached 
the door.</p>
                  <p>“What news, gentlemen?” he asked with his 
pleasant smile. “For two days I have been beyond the 
papers.”</p>
                  <p>“Then there's news enough, Governor,” 
responded several voices, uniting in a common 
excitement. “There's news enough since Tuesday, and 
yet we're waiting here for more. The President
<pb n="278"/>											
has called for troops from Virginia to invade the 
South.”</p>
                  <p>“To invade the South,” repeated the Governor, 
paling, and a man behind him took up the words and 
said them over with a fine sarcasm, “To invade the 
South!”</p>
                  <p>The Governor turned away and walked to the end of 
the little porch, where he stood leaning upon the 
railing. With his eyes on the blossoming locust tree, 
he waited, in helpless patience, for the words to enter 
into his thoughts and to readjust his conceptions of 
the last few months. There slowly came to him, as he 
recognized the portentous gravity in the air about 
him, something of the significance of that ringing 
call; and as he stood there he saw before him the 
vision of an army led by strangers against the people 
of its blood—of an army wasting the soil it loved, 
warring for an alien right against the convictions it 
clung to and the faith it cherished.</p>
                  <p>His brow darkened, and he turned with set lips to 
the group upon the steps. He was about to speak, but 
before the words were uttered, there was a cheer 
from the open doorway, and a man, waving a 
despatch in his hand, came running into the crowd.</p>
                  <p>“Last night there was a secret session,” he cried 
gayly, “and Virginia has seceded! hurrah! hurrah! 
Virginia has seceded!” The gay voice passed, and 
the speaker, still waving the paper in his hand, ran 
down into the street.</p>
                  <p>The men upon the porch looked at one another, 
and were silent. In the bright sunshine their faces 
showed pale and troubled, and when the sound of 
cheers came floating from the courthouse green,
<pb n="279"/>											
they started as if at the first report of cannon. Then, 
raising his hand, the Governor bared his head and 
spoke:—</p>
                  <p>“God bless Virginia, gentlemen,” he said.</p>
                  <p>The next week Champe came home from college, 
flushed with enthusiasm, eager to test his steel.</p>
                  <p>“It's great news, uncle,” were his first joyful 
words, as he shook the Major's hand.</p>
                  <p>“That it is, my boy, that it is,” chuckled the 
Major, in a high good-humour.</p>
                  <p>“I'm going, you know,” went on the young man 
lightly. “They're getting up a company in 
Leicesterburg, and I'm to be Captain. I got a letter 
about it a week ago, and I've been studying like 
thunder ever since.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, well, it will be a pleasant little change for 
you,” responded the old man. “There's nothing like 
a few weeks of war to give one an appetite.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot looked up from her knitting with a 
serious face.</p>
                  <p>“Don't you think it may last months, Mr. 
Lightfoot?” she inquired dubiously. “I was 
wondering if I hadn't better supply Champe with 
extra underclothing.</p>
                  <p>“Tut-tut, ma'am,” protested the Major, warmly.    
“Can't you leave such things as war to my judgment? 
Haven't I been in two? Months! Nonsense! Why, in 
two weeks we'll sweep every Yankee in the country 
as far north as Greenland. Two weeks will be ample 
time, ma'am.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I give them six months,” generously 
remarked Champe, in defiance of the Major's 
gathering frown.</p>
                  <pb n="280"/>
                  <p>“And what do you know about it, sir?” demanded 
the old gentleman. “Were you in the War of 1812? 
Were you even in the Mexican War, sir?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, hardly,” replied Champe, smiling, “but all 
the same I give them six months to get whipped.”</p>
                  <p>“I'm sure I hope it will be over before winter,” 
observed Mrs. Lightfoot, glancing round. “Things 
will be a little upset, I fear.”</p>
                  <p>The Major twitched with anger. “There you go 
again—both of you!” he exclaimed.  “I might 
suppose after all these years you would place some 
reliance on my judgment; but, no, you will keep up 
your croaking until our troops are dictating terms at 
Washington. Six months!  Tush!”</p>
                  <p>“Professor Bates thinks it will take a year,” 
returned Champe, his interest overleaping his 
discretion.</p>
                  <p>“And when did he fight, sir?” inquired the 
Major.</p>
                  <p>“Well, any way, it's safer to prepare for six 
months,” was Champe's rejoinder. “I shouldn't like 
to run short of things, you know.”</p>
                  <p>“You'll do nothing of the kind, sir,” thundered 
the Major. “It's going to be a two weeks' war, and you 
shall take an outfit for two weeks, or stay at home! 
By God, sir, if you contradict me again I'll not let 
you go to fight the Yankees.”</p>
                  <p>Champe stared for an instant into the inflamed 
face of the old gentleman, and then his cheery smile 
broke out.</p>
                  <p>“That settles it, uncle,” he said soothingly. 
“It's to be a war of two weeks, and I'll come home a
Major-general before the holidays.”</p>

                  <head>HOW MERRY GENTLEMEN WENT TO WAR</head>
                  <p>THE July sun fell straight and hot upon the camp, 
and Dan, as he sat on a woodpile and ate a green 
apple, wistfully cast his eyes about for a deeper 
shade. But the young tree from which he had just 
shaken its last fruit stood alone between the scattered 
tents and the blur of willows down the gentle slope, 
and beneath its speckled shadow the mess had 
gathered sleepily, after the mid-day meal.</p>
                  <p>In the group of privates, stretched under the 
gauzy shade on the trampled grass, the first thing 
to strike an observer would have been, perhaps, 
their surprising youth. They were all young—the 
eldest hardly more than three and twenty—and the 
faces bore a curious resemblance in type, as if they 
were, one and all, variations from a common stock. 
There was about them, too, a peculiar expression 
of enthusiasm, showing even in the faces of those 
who slept; a single wave of emotion which, rising 
to its height in an entire people revealed
<pb n="284"/>											
itself in the features of the individual soldier. As yet 
the flower of the South had not withered on its stalk, 
and the men first gathered to defend the borders were 
men who embraced a cause as fervently as they 
would embrace a woman; men in whom the love of 
an abstract principle became, not a religion, but a 
romantic passion.</p>
                  <p>Beyond them, past the scattered tents and the piles 
of clean straw, the bruised grass of the field swept 
down to a little stream and the fallen stones that had 
once marked off the turnpike. Farther away, there 
was a dark stretch of pines relieved against the faint 
blue tracery of the distant mountains.</p>
                  <p>Dan, sitting in the thin shelter on the woodpile, 
threw a single glance at the strip of pines, and 
brought back his gaze to Big Abel who was splitting 
an oak log hard by. The work had been assigned to 
the master, who had, in turn, tossed it to the servant, 
with the remark that he “came out to kill men, not to 
cut wood.”</p>
                  <p>“I say, Big Abel, this sun's blazing hot,” he now 
offered cheerfully.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel paused for a moment and wiped his 
brow with his blue cotton sleeve.</p>
                  <p>“Dis yer ain' no oak, caze it's w'it-leather,” 
he rejoined in an injured tone, as he lifted the axe 
and sent it with all his might into the shivering log, 
which threw out a shower of fine chips. The powerful 
stroke brought into play the negro's splendid 
muscles, and Dan, watching him, carelessly observed 
to a young fellow lying half asleep upon the ground, 
“Big Abel could whip us all, Bland, if he had a mind 
to.”</p>
                  <pb n="285"/>
                  <p>Bland grunted and opened his eyes; then he 
yawned, stretched his arms, and sat up against the 
logs. He was bright and boyish-looking, with a frank 
tanned face, which made his curling flaxen hair seem 
almost white.</p>
                  <p>“I worked like a darky hauling yesterday,” he said 
reproachfully, “but when your turn comes, you 
climb a woodpile and pass the job along. When we 
go into battle I suppose Dandy and you will sit down 
to boil coffee, and hand your muskets to the 
servants.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, are we ever going into battle?” growled Jack 
Powell from the other side. “Here I've been at this 
blamed drilling until I'm stiff in every joint, and I 
haven't seen so much as the tail end of a fight. You 
may rant as long as you please about martial glory, 
but if there's any man who thinks it's fun merely to 
get dirty and eat raw food, well, he's welcome to my 
share of it, that's all. I haven't had so much as one of 
the necessities of life since I settled down in this old 
field; even my hair has taken to standing on end. I 
say, Beau, do you happen to have any pomade about 
you? Oh, you needn't jeer, Bland, there's no danger 
of your getting bald, with that sheepskin over your 
scalp; and, besides, I'm willing enough to sacrifice 
my life for my country. I object only to giving it my 
hair instead.”</p>
                  <p>“I believe you'll find a little in my knapsack,” 
gravely replied Dan, to be assailed on the spot by a 
chorus of comic demands.</p>
                  <p>“I say, Beau, have you any rouge on hand? I'm 
growing pale. Please drop a little cologne on
<pb n="286"/>											
this handkerchief, my boy. May I borrow your 
powder puff? I've been sitting in the sun. Don't you 
want that gallon of stale buttermilk to take your tan 
off, Miss Nancy?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, shut up!” cried Dan, sharply; “if you 
choose to turn pigs simply because you've come out 
to do a little fighting, I've nothing to say against it; 
but I prefer to remain a gentleman, that's all.”</p>
                  <p>“He prefers to remain a gentleman, that's all,” 
chanted the chorus round the apple tree.</p>
                  <p>“And I'll knock your confounded heads off, if you 
keep this up,” pursued Dan furiously.</p>
                  <p>“And he'll knock our confounded heads off, if we 
keep this up,” shouted the chorus in a jubilant 
refrain.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'll tell you one thing,” remarked Jack 
Powell, feeling his responsibility in the matter of the 
pomade. “All I've got to say is, if this is what you 
call war, it's a pretty stale business. The next time I 
want to be frisky, I'll volunteer to pass the lemonade 
at a Sunday-school picnic.”</p>
                  <p>“And has anybody called it war, Dandy?” inquired 
Bland, witheringly.</p>
                  <p>“Well, somebody might, you know,” replied Jack, 
opening his fine white shirt at the neck, “did I hear 
you call it war, Kemper?” he asked politely, as he 
punched a stout sleeper beside him.</p>
                  <p>Kemper started up and aimed a blow at vacancy.  
“Oh, you heard the devil!” he retorted.</p>
                  <p>“I beg your pardon; it was mistaken identity,” 
returned Jack suavely.</p>
                  <p>“Look here, my lad, don't fool with Kemper when 
he's hot,” cautioned Bland. “He's red enough
<pb n="287"/>											
to fire those bales of straw. I say, Kemper, may I 
light my pipe at your face?”</p>
                  <p>“Shut up, now, or he'll be puffing round here 
like a steam engine,” said a small dark man named 
Baker, “let smouldering fires lie on a day like this. 
Give me a light, Dandy.”</p>
                  <p>Jack Powell held out his cigar, and then, leaning 
back against the tree, blew a cloud of smoke about 
his head.</p>
                  <p>“I'll be blessed if I don't think seven hours' 
drill is too much of a bad thing,” he plaintively 
remarked; “and I may as well add, by the bye, that the 
next time I go to war, I intend to go in the character 
of a Major-general.”</p>
                  <p>“Make it Commander-in-chief. Don't be too 
modest, my boy.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you may laugh if you like,” pursued 
Jack, “but between you and me, it was all the fault 
of those girls at home—they have an idea that 
patriotism never trims its sleeves, you know. On my 
word, I might have been Captain of the Leicesterburg 
Guards after Champe Lightfoot joined the cavalry; but 
such averted looks were turned from me by the ladies, 
that I had to jump into the ranks merely to reinstate 
myself in their regard. They made even Governor Ambler 
volunteer as a private, I believe, but he was lucky and 
got made a Colonel instead.”</p>
                  <p>Bland laughed softly.</p>
                  <p>“That reminds me of our Colonel,” he observed.    
“I overheard him talking to himself the other day, 
and he said: ‘All I ask is not to be in command of a 
volunteer regiment in hell.’”</p>
                  <pb n="288"/>
                  <p>“Oh, he won't,” put in Dan; “all the volunteers 
will be in heaven—unless they're sent down below 
because they were too big fools to join the cavalry.” </p>
                  <p>“Then, in heaven's name, why didn't you join the 
cavalry?” inquired Baker.</p>
                  <p>Dan looked at him a moment, and then threw the 
apple core at a water bucket that stood upside down 
upon the grass. “Well, I couldn't go on my own 
horse, you see,” he replied, “and I wouldn't go on 
the Government's. I don't ride hacks.”</p>
                  <p>“So you came into the infantry to get 
court-martialled,” remarked Bland. “The captain 
said down the valley, you'll remember, that if the 
war lasted a month, you'd be court-martialled for 
disobedience on the thirtieth day.”</p>
                  <p>Dan growled under his breath. “Well, I didn't 
enter the army to be hectored by any fool who comes 
along,” he returned. “Look at that fellow Jones, 
now. He thinks because he happens to be Lieutenant 
that he's got a right to forget that I'm a gentleman 
and he's not. Why, the day before we came up here, 
he got after me at drill about being out of step, or 
some little thing like that; and, by George, to hear 
him roar you'd have thought that war wasn't 
anything but monkeying round with a musket. Why, 
the rascal came from my part of the country, and his 
father before him wasn't fit to black my boots.”</p>
                  <p>“Did you knock him down?” eagerly inquired 
Bland.</p>
                  <p>“I told him to take off his confounded finery and 
I would,”  answered Dan.  “So when drill was over,
<pb n="289"/>											
we went off behind a tent, and I smashed his nose. 
He's no coward, I'll say that for him, and when the 
Captain told him he looked as if he'd been fighting, 
he laughed and said he had had ‘a little personal 
encounter with the enemy.’”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'm willing enough to do battle for my 
country,” said Jack Powell, “but I'll be blessed if 
I'm going to have my elbow jogged by the poor 
white trash while I'm doing it.”</p>
                  <p>“He was scolding at us yesterday because when 
we were detailed to clean out the camp, we gave the 
order to the servants,” put in Baker. “Clean out the 
camp! Does he think my grandmother was a chambermaid?” 
He suddenly broke of off and helped himself to a drink 
of water from a dripping bucket that a tall mountaineer 
was passing round the group.</p>
                  <p>“Been to the creek, Pinetop?” he asked 
good-humouredly.</p>
                  <p>The mountaineer, who had won his title from 
his great height, towering as he did above every 
man in the company, nodded drowsily as he settled 
himself upon the ground. He was lithe and hardy as 
a young hickory, and his abundant hair was of the 
colour of ripe wheat. At the call to arms he had 
come, with long strides, down from his bare little 
cabin in the Blue Ridge, bringing with him a 
flintlock musket, a corncob pipe, and a stockingful 
of Virginia tobacco. Since the day of his arrival, 
he had accepted the pointed jokes of the mess into 
which he had drifted, with grave lips and a flicker 
of his calm blue eyes. They had jeered him 
unmercifully, and he had regarded them with serene
<pb n="290"/>											
and wondering attention. “I say, Pinetop, is it 
raining up where you are?” a wit had put to him on 
the first day, and he had looked down and answered 
placidly:—</p>
                  <p>“Naw, it's cl'ar.”</p>
                  <p>As he sat down in the group beside the woodpile, 
Bland tossed him the latest paper, but carefully 
folding it into a square, he laid it aside, and stretched 
himself upon the brown grass.</p>
                  <p>“This here's powerful weather for sweatin',” he 
pleasantly observed, as he pulled a mullein leaf from 
the foot of the apple tree and placed it over his eyes. 
Then he turned over and in a moment was sleeping 
as quietly as a child.</p>
                  <p>Dan got down from the logs and stood 
thoughtfully staring in the direction of the happy 
little town lying embosomed in green hills. That little 
town gave to him, as he stood there in the noon heat, 
a memory of deep gardens filled with fragrance, of 
open houses set in blue shadows, and of the bright 
fluttering of Confederate flags. For a moment he 
looked toward it down the hot road; then, with a 
sigh, he turned away and wandered off to seek the 
outside shadow of a tent.</p>
                  <p>As he flung himself down in the strip of shade, 
his gaze went longingly to the dim chain of 
mountains which showed like faint blue clouds 
against the sky, while his thoughts returned, as a 
sick man's, to the clustered elm boughs and the 
smooth lawn at Chericoke, and to Betty blooming 
like a flower in a network of sun and shade.</p>
                  <p>The memory was so vivid that when he closed his 
eyes it was almost as if he heard the tapping of
<pb n="291"/>											
the tree-tops against the roof, and felt the pleasant 
breeze blowing over the sweet-smelling meadows. 
He looked, through his closed eyes, into the dim old 
house, seeing the rustling grasses in the great blue 
jar and their delicate shadow trembling on the pure 
white wall. There was the tender hush about it that 
belongs to the memories of dead friends or absent 
places; a hush that was reverent as a Sabbath calm. 
He saw the shining swords of the Major and the 
Major's father; the rear door with the microphylla 
roses nodding upon the lintel, and, high above all, 
the shadowy bend of the staircase, with Betty 
standing there in her cool blue gown.</p>
                  <p>He opened his eyes with a start, and pillowing his 
head on his arm, lay looking off into the burning 
distance. A bee, straying from a field of clover 
across the road, buzzed, for a moment, round his 
face, and then knocked, with a flapping noise, 
against the canvas tent. Far away, beyond the 
murmur of the camp, he heard a partridge whistling 
in a tangled meadow; and at the same instant his 
own name called through the sunlight.</p>
                  <p>“I say, Beau, Beau, where are you?” He sat up, 
and shouted in response, and Jack Powell came 
hurriedly round the tent to fling himself down upon 
the beaten grass.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you don't know what you missed!” he cried, 
chuckling. “You didn't stay long enough to hear the 
joke on Bland.”</p>
                  <p>“I hope it's a fresh one,” was Dan's response. 
“If it's that old thing about the  mule and the darky, I 
may as well say in the beginning that I heard it in the 
ark.”</p>
                  <pb n="292"/>
                  <p>“Oh, it's new, old man. He made the mistake of 
trying to get some fun out of Pinetop, and he got 
more than he bargained for, that's all. He began to 
tease him about those blue jean trousers he carries 
in his knapsack. You've seen them, I reckon?”</p>
                  <p>Dan nodded as he chewed idly at a blade of grass. 
“I tried to get him to throw them away yesterday,” 
he said, “and he did go so far as to haul them out 
and look them over; but after meditating a half hour, 
he packed them away again and declared there was 
‘a sight of  wear left in them still.’ He told me if he 
ever made up his mind to get rid of them, and peace 
should come next day, he'd never forgive himself.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I warned Bland not to meddle with him,” 
pursued Jack, “but he got bored and set in to make 
things lively. ‘Look here, Pinetop,’ he began, 
‘will you do me the favour to give me the name of 
the tailor who made your blue jeans?’ and, bless 
your life, Pinetop just took the mullein leaf from 
his eyes, and sang out ‘Maw.’ That was what Bland 
wanted, of course, so, without waiting for the 
danger signal, he plunged in again. ‘Then if you 
don't object I should be glad to have the pattern 
of them,’ he went on, as smooth as butter. ‘I want 
them to wear when I go home again, you know. Why, 
they're just the things to take a lady's eye—they 
have almost the fit of a flour-sack—and the 
ladies are fond of flour, aren't they?’ The whole 
crowd was waiting, ready to howl at Pinetop's answer, 
and, sure enough, he raised himself on his elbow, and 
drawled out in his sing-song tone: ‘I
<pb n="293"/>											
say, Sonny, ain't yo' Maw done put you into 
breeches yit?’”</p>
                  <p>“It serves him right,” said Dan sternly, “and 
that's what I like about Pinetop, Jack, there's no 
ruffling him.” He brushed off the bee that had fallen 
on his head, and dodged as it angrily flew back 
again.</p>
                  <p>“Some of the boys raised a row when he came 
into our mess,” returned Jack, “but where every 
man's fighting for his country, we're all equal, say I. 
What makes me dog-tired, though, is the airs some 
of these fool officers put on; all this talk about an 
‘officer's mess’ now, as if a man is too good to eat 
with me who wouldn't dare to sit down to my table if 
he had on civilian's clothes. It's all bosh, that's what 
it is.”</p>
                  <p>He got up and strolled off with his grievance, 
and Dan, stretching himself upon the ground, looked 
across the hills, to the far mountains where the 
shadows thickened.</p>

                  <head>THE DAY  MARCH</head>
                  <p>IN the gray dawn tents were struck, and five 
days' rations were issued with the marching orders. As 
Dan packed his knapsack with trembling hands, he 
saw men stalking back and forth like gigantic 
shadows, and heard the hoarse shouting of the 
company officers through the thick fog which had 
rolled down from the mountains. There was a 
persistent buzz in the air, as if a great swarm of bees 
had settled over the misty valley. Each man was 
asking unanswerable questions of his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>At a little distance Big Abel, with several of 
the company “darkies” was struggling energetically 
over the property of the mess, storing the cooking 
utensils into a stout camp chest, which the strength 
of several men would lift, when filled, into the 
wagon. Bland, who had just tossed his overcoat 
across to them, turned abruptly upon Dan, and 
demanded warmly “what had become of his case of 
razors?”</p>
                  <p>“Where are we going?” was Dan's response, as 
he knelt down to roll up his oilcloth and blanket.      
“By Jove, it looks as if we'd gobble up Patterson for 
breakfast!”</p>
                  <p>“I say, where's my case of razors?” inquired 
Bland, with irritation. “They were lying here a
<pb n="295"/>										
moment ago, and now they're gone. Dandy, have 
you got my razors?”</p>
                  <p>“Look here, Beau, what are you going to leave 
behind?” asked Kemper over Bland's shoulder.</p>
                  <p>“Leave behind? Why, dull care,” rejoined Dan 
gayly. “By the way, Pinetop, why don't you save 
your appetite for Patterson's dainties?”</p>
                  <p>Pinetop, who was leisurely eating his breakfast of 
“hardtack” and bacon, took a long draught from his 
tin cup, and replied, as he wiped his mouth on his 
shirt sleeve, that he “reckoned thar wouldn't be any 
trouble about finding room for them, too.”  The 
general gayety was reflected in his face; he laughed 
as he bit deeply into his half-cooked bacon.</p>
                  <p>Dan stood up and nervously strapped on his 
knapsack; then he swung his canteen over his 
shoulder and carefully tightened his belt. His face 
was flushed, and when he spoke his voice quivered 
with emotion. It seemed to him that the delay of 
every instant was a reckless waste of time, and he 
trembled at the thought that the enemy might be 
preparing to fall upon them unawares; that while the 
camp was swarming like an ant's nest, Patterson and 
his men might be making good use of the fleeting 
moments.</p>
                  <p>“Why the devil don't we move? We ought to move,” 
he said angrily, as he glanced round the crowded 
field where the men were arraying themselves in all 
the useless trappings of the Southern volunteer. 
Kemper was busily placing his necessary toilet 
articles in his haversack, having thrown away half 
his rations for the purpose; Jack Powell, completely 
dressed for the march, was examining
<pb n="296"/>									
his heavy revolver, with the conscious pride a 
field officer might have felt in his sword. As he stuck 
it into his belt, he straightened himself with a laugh 
and jauntily set his small cap on his curling hair; he 
was clean, comely, and smooth-shaven as if he had 
just stepped from a hot bath and the hands of his 
barber.</p>
                  <p>“You may roll Dandy in the dust and he'll come 
out washed,” Baker had once forcibly remarked.</p>
                  <p>“I say, boys, why don't we start?” persisted Dan 
impatiently, flicking with his handkerchief at a grain 
of sand on his high boots. Then, as Big Abel brought 
him a cup of coffee, he drank it standing, casting 
eager glances over the rim of his cup. He had an odd 
feeling that it was all a great fox hunt they were soon 
to start upon; that they were waiting only for the 
calling of the hounds. The Major's fighting blood had 
stirred within his grandson's veins, and generations 
of dead Lightfoots were scenting the coming battle 
from the dust. When Dan thought now of the end to 
which he should presently be marching, it suggested 
to him but a quickened exhilaration of the pulses and 
an old engraving of “Waterloo,” which hung on the 
dining-room wall at Chericoke. That was war; and 
he remembered vividly the childish thrill with which 
he had first looked up at it. He saw the prancing 
horses, the dramatic gestures of the generals with 
flowing hair, the blur of waving flags and naked 
swords. It was like a page torn from the eternal 
Romance; a page upon which he and his comrades 
should play heroic parts; and it was white blood, indeed, 
that did not glow with the hope of sharing in that
<pb n="297"/>									
picture; of hanging immortal in an engraving on the 
wall.</p>
                  <p>The “fall in” of the sergeant was already 
sounding from the road, and, with a last glance 
about the field, Dan ran down the gentle slope and 
across the little stream to take his place in the ranks 
of the forming column. An officer on a milk-white 
horse was making frantic gestures to the line, and the 
young man followed him an instant with his eyes. 
Then, as he stood there in the warm sunshine, he felt 
his impatience prick him like a needle. He wanted to 
push forward the regiments in front of him, to start 
in any direction—only to start. The suppressed 
excitement of the fox hunt was upon him, and the 
hoarse voices of the officers thrilled him as if they 
were the baying of the hounds. He heard the musical 
jingle of moving cavalry, the hurried tread of feet 
in the soft dust, the smothered oaths of men who 
stumbled over the scattered stones. And, at last, 
when the sun stood high above, the long column 
swung off toward the south, leaving the enemy and 
the north behind it.</p>
                  <p>“By God, we're running away,” said Bland in a 
whisper. With the words the gayety passed suddenly 
from the army, and it moved slowly with the 
dispirited tread of beaten men. The enemy lay to the 
north, and it was marching to the south and home.</p>
                  <p>As it passed through the fragrant streets of 
Winchester, women, with startled eyes, ran from 
open doors into the deep old gardens, and watched it 
over the honeysuckle hedges. Under the flutter
<pb n="298"/>											
fluttering flags, past the long blue shadows, with the 
playing of the bands and the clatter of the canteens 
- on it went into the white dust and the sunshine. 
From a wide piazza a group of schoolgirls pelted the 
troops with roses, and as Dan went by he caught a 
white bud and stuck it into his cap. He looked back 
laughing, to meet the flash of laughing eyes; then the 
gray line swept out upon the turnpike and went down 
the broad road through the smooth green fields, over 
which the sunlight lay like melted gold.</p>
                  <p>Dan, walking between Pinetop and Jack Powell, 
felt a sudden homesickness for the abandoned camp, 
which they were leaving with the gay little town and 
the red clay forts, naked to the enemy's guns. He saw 
the branching apple tree, the burned-out fires, the 
silvery fringe of willows by the stream; and he saw 
the men in blue already in possession of his 
woodpile, broiling their bacon by the logs that Big 
Abel had cut.</p>
                  <p>At the end of three miles the brigades abruptly 
halted, and he listened, looking at the ground, to an 
order, which was read by a slim young officer who 
pulled nervously at his moustache. Down the column 
came a single ringing cheer, and, without waiting for 
the command, the men pushed eagerly forward along 
the road. What was a forced march of thirty miles to 
an army that had never seen a battle?</p>
                  <p>As they went on a boyish merriment tripped 
lightly down the turnpike; jests were shouted, wit 
began to tease a mounted officer who was trying to 
reach the front, and somebody with a tenor voice
<pb n="299"/>											
was singing “Dixie.” A stray countryman, sitting 
upon the wall of loose stones, was greeted 
affectionately by each passing company. He was a 
big, stupid-looking man, with a gray fowl hanging, 
head downward, from his hand, and as he responded 
“Howdy,” in an expressionless tone, the fowl craned 
its long neck upward and pecked at the creeper on 
the wall.</p>
                  <p>“Howdy, Jim!” “Howdy, Peter!”  “Howdy, 
Luke!” sang the first line. “How's your wife?”          
“How's your wife's mother?” “How's your 
sister-in-law's uncle?” inquired the next. The 
countryman spat into the ditch and stared solemnly 
in reply, and the gray fowl, still craning its neck, 
pecked steadily at the leaves upon the stones.</p>
                  <p>Dan looked up into the blue sky, across the open 
meadows to the far-off low mountains, and then 
down the long turnpike where the dust hung in a 
yellow cloud. In the bright sunshine he saw the flash 
of steel and the glitter of gold braid, and the noise of 
tramping feet cheered him like music as he walked 
on gayly, filled with visions. For was he not 
marching to his chosen end—to victory, to 
Chericoke—to Betty? Or if the worst came to the 
worst—well, a man had but one life, after all, and a 
life was a little thing to give his country. Then, as 
always, his patriotism appealed to him as a romance 
rather than a religion—the fine Southern ardour 
which had sent him, at the first call, into the ranks, 
had sprung from an inward,—not an outward 
pressure. The sound of the bugle, the fluttering of 
the flags, the flash of hot steel in the sunlight, the 
high old words that stirred men's pulses
<pb n="300"/>											
—these things were his by blood and right of 
heritage. He could no more have stifled the impulse 
that prompted him to take a side in any fight than he 
could have kept his heart cool beneath the 
impassioned voice of a Southern orator. The Major's 
blood ran warm through many generations.</p>
                  <p>“I say, Beau, did you put a millstone in my 
knapsack?” inquired Bland suddenly. His face was 
flushed, and there was a streak of wet dust across 
his forehead. “If you did, it was a dirty joke,” he 
added irritably. Dan laughed. “Now that's odd,” he 
replied, “because there's one in mine also, and, 
moreover, somebody has stuck penknives in my 
boots. Was it you, Pinetop?”</p>
                  <p>But the mountaineer shook his head in silence, and 
then, as they halted to rest upon the roadside, he 
flung himself down beneath the shadow of a 
sycamore, and raised his canteen to his lips. He had 
come leisurely at his long strides, and as Dan looked 
at him lying upon the short grass by the wall, he 
shook his own roughened hair, in impatient envy. 
“Why, you've stood it like a Major, Pinetop,” he 
remarked.</p>
                  <p>Pinetop opened his eyes. “Stood what?” he 
drawled.</p>
                  <p>“Why, this heat, this dust, this whole confounded 
march. I don't believe you've turned a hair, as Big 
Abel says.”</p>
                  <p>“Good Lord,” said Pinetop. “I don't reckon you've 
ever ploughed up hill with a steer team.”</p>
                  <p>Without replying, Dan unstrapped his knapsack 
and threw it upon the roadside. “What doesn't go
<pb n="301"/>											
in my haversack, doesn't go, that's all,” he 
observed.  “How about you, Dandy?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I threw mine away a mile after starting,” 
returned Jack Powell, “my luxuries are with a girl I 
left behind me. I've sacrificed everything to the 
cause except my toothbrush, and, by Jove, if the 
weight of that goes on increasing, I shall be forced 
to dispense with it forever. I got rid of my rations 
long ago. Pinetop says a man can't starve in 
blackberry season, and I hope he's right. Anyway, 
the Lord will provide—or he won't, that's certain.”</p>
                  <p>“Is this the reward of faith, I wonder?” said 
Dan, as he looked at a lame old negro who wheeled 
a cider cart and a tray of green apple pies down a 
red clay lane that branched off under thick locust 
trees. “This way, Uncle, here's your man.”</p>
                  <p>The old negro slowly approached them to be 
instantly surrounded by the thirsty regiment.</p>
                  <p>“Howdy, Marsters? howdy?” he began, pulling 
his grizzled hair. “Dese yer's right nice pies, dat dey 
is, suh.”</p>
                  <p>“Look here, Uncle, weren't they made in the ark, 
now?” inquired Bland jestingly, as he bit into a 
greasy crust.</p>
                  <p>“De ark? naw, suh; my Mehaley she des done 
bake 'em in de cabin over yonder.” He lifted his 
shrivelled hand and pointed, with a tremulous 
gesture, to a log hut showing among the distant 
trees.</p>
                  <p>“What? are you a free man, Uncle?”</p>
                  <p>“Free? Go 'way f'om yer! ain' you never hyearn 
tell er Marse Plunkett?”</p>
                  <p>“Plunkett?”  gravely repeated Bland, filling his
<pb n="302"/>											
canteen with cider. “Look here, stand back, boys, 
it's my turn now.—Plunkett—Plunkett—can I have 
a long-lost friend named Plunkett? Where is he, 
Uncle? has he gone to fight?”</p>
                  <p>“Marse Plunkett? Naw, suh, he ain' fit nobody.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you tell him from me that he'd better enlist 
at once,” put in Jack Powell. “This isn't the time for 
skulkers, Uncle; he's on our side, isn't he?”  The old 
negro shook his head, looking uneasily at the froth 
that dripped from the keg into the dust.</p>
                  <p>“Naw, suh, Marse Plunkett, he's fur de Un'on, but 
he's pow'ful feared er de Yankees,” he returned.</p>
                  <p>Bland broke into a laugh. “Oh, come, that's 
downright treason,” he protested merrily. “Your 
Marse Plunkett's a skulker sure enough, and you 
may tell him so with my compliments. You're on the 
Yankee side, too, I reckon, and there're bullets in 
these pies, sure as I live.”</p>
                  <p>The old man shuffled nervously on his bare feet.</p>
                  <p>“Go 'way, Marster, w'at I know 'bout 'sides'?” 
he replied, tilting his keg to drain the last few 
drops into the canteen of a thirsty soldier. “I'se on 
de Lawd's side, dat's whar I is.”</p>
                  <p>He fell back startled, for the call of “Column, 
forward!” was shouted down the road, and in an 
instant the men had left the emptied cart, and were 
marching on into the sunny distance.</p>
                  <p>As the afternoon lengthened the heat grew more 
oppressive. Straight ahead there was dust and 
sunshine and the ceaseless tramp, and on either side 
the fresh fields were scorched and whitened by
<pb n="303"/>											
a powdering of hot sand. Beyond the rise and dip of 
the hills, the mountains burned like blue flames on 
the horizon, and overhead the sky was hard as an 
inverted brazier.</p>
                  <p>Dan had begun to limp, for his stiff boots galled 
his feet. His senses were blunted by the hot sand 
which filled his eyes and ears and nostrils, and there 
was a shimmer over all the broad landscape. When 
he shook his hair from his forehead, the dust floated 
slowly down and settled in a scorching ring about 
his neck.</p>
                  <p>The day closed gradually, and as they neared the 
river, the mountains emerged from obscure outlines 
into wooded heights upon which the trees showed 
soft and gray in the sunset. A cool breath was blown 
through a strip of damp woodland, where the pale 
bodies of the sycamores were festooned in luxuriant 
vines, and from the twilight long shadows stretched 
across the red clay road. Then, as they went down a 
rocky slope, a fringe of willows appeared suddenly 
from the blur of green, and they saw the 
Shenandoah running between falling banks, with the 
colours of the sunset floating like pink flowers upon 
its breast.</p>
                  <p>With a shout the front line plunged into the 
stream, holding its heavy muskets high above the 
current of the water, and filing upon the opposite 
bank, into a rough road which wound amid the 
ferns.</p>
                  <p>Midway of the river, near the fording point, there 
was a little island which lay like a feathery treetop 
upon the tinted water; and as Dan went by, he felt 
the brush of willows on his face and heard
			
<pb n="304"/>											
the soft lapping of the small waves upon the shore. 
The keen smell of the sycamores drifted to him from 
the bank that he had left, and straight up stream he 
saw a single peaked blue hill upon which a white 
cloud rested. For a moment he lingered, breathing in 
the fragrance, then the rear line pressed upon him, 
and, crossing rapidly, he stood on the rocky edge, 
shaking the water from his clothes. Out of the 
after-glow came the steady tramp of tired feet, and 
with aching limbs, he turned and hastened with the 
column into the mountain pass.</p>

                  <head>III</head>
                  <head>THE  REIGN OF THE BRUTE</head>
                  <p>THE noise of the guns rolled over the green hills 
into the little valley where the regiment had halted before 
a wayside spring, which lay hidden beneath a clump of 
rank pokeberry. As each company filled its canteens, it 
filed across the sunny road, from which the dust rose 
like steam, and stood resting in an open meadow that 
swept down into a hollow between two gently rising 
hills. From the spring a thin stream trickled, bordered 
by short grass, and the water, dashed from it by the 
thirsty men, gathered in shining puddles in the red clay 
road. By one of these puddles a man had knelt to wash 
his face, and as Dan passed, draining his canteen, he 
looked up with a sprinkling of brown drops on his 
forehead. Near him, unharmed by the tramping feet, a 
little purple flower was blooming in the mud.</p>
                  <p>Dan gazed thoughtfully down upon him and upon the 
little purple flower in its dangerous spot. What did 
mud or dust matter, he questioned grimly, when in a 
breathing space they would be in the midst of the 
smoke that hung close above the hill-top? The sound 
of the cannon ceased suddenly, as abruptly as if the 
battery had sunk into the ground, and through the sunny 
air he heard a long rattle that reminded
<pb n="306"/>											
him of the fall of hail on the shingled roof at 
Chericoke. As his canteen struck against his side, it 
seemed to him that it met the resistance of a leaden 
weight. There was a lump in his throat and his lips 
felt parched, though the moisture from the fresh 
spring water was hardly dried. When he moved he 
was conscious of stepping high above the earth, as he 
had done once at college after an over-merry night and 
many wines.</p>
                  <p>Straight ahead the sunshine lay hot and still over 
the smooth fields and the little hollow where a 
brook ran between marshy banks. High above he 
saw it flashing on the gray smoke that hung in tatters 
from the tree-tops on the hill.</p>
                  <p>An ambulance, drawn by a white and a bay horse, 
turned gayly from the road into the meadow, and he 
saw, with surprise, that one of the surgeons was 
trimming his finger nails with a small penknife. The 
surgeon was a slight young man, with pointed yellow 
whiskers, and light blue eyes that squinted in the 
sunshine. As he passed he stifled a yawn with an 
elaborate affectation of unconcern.</p>
                  <p>A man on horseback, with a white handkerchief 
tied above his collar, galloped up and spoke in a low 
voice to the Colonel. Then, as his horse reared, he 
glanced nervously about, grew embarrassed, and, 
with a sharp jerk of the bridle, galloped off again 
across the field. Presently other men rode back and 
forth along the road; there were so many of them that 
Dan wondered, bewildered, if anybody was left to 
make the battle beyond the hill.</p>
                  <p>The regiment formed into line and started at          
“double quick” across the broad meadow powdered
<pb n="307"/>											
white with daisies. As it went into the ravine, 
skirting the hillside, a stream of men came toward it 
and passed slowly to the rear. Some were on 
stretchers, some were stumbling in the arms of 
slightly wounded comrades, some were merely
warm and dirty and very much afraid. One and all 
advised the fresh regiment to “go home and finish 
ploughing.” “The Yankees have got us on the hip,” 
they declared emphatically. “Whoopee! it's as hot as 
hell where you're going.” Then a boy, with a 
blood-stained sleeve, waved his shattered arm in the 
air and laughed deliriously. “Don't believe them, 
friends, it's glorious!” he cried, in the voice of the far 
South, and lurched forward upon the grass.</p>
                  <p>The sight of the soaked shirt and the smell of blood 
turned Dan faint. He felt a sudden tremor in his 
limbs, and his arteries throbbed dully in his ears. “I 
didn't know it was like this,” he muttered thickly. 
“Why, they're no better than mangled rabbits—I 
didn't know it was like this.”</p>
                  <p>They wound through the little ravine, climbed a 
hillside planted in thin corn, and were ordered to      
“load and lie down” in a strip of woodland. Dan 
tore at his cartridge with set teeth; then as he 
drove his ramrod home, a shell, thrown from a 
distant gun, burst in the trees above him, and a red 
flame ran, for an instant, along the barrel of his 
musket. He dodged quickly, and a rain of young 
pine needles fell in scattered showers from the 
smoked boughs overhead. Somewhere beside him 
a man was groaning in terror or in pain. “I'm hit, 
boys, by God, I'm hit this time.” The groans
<pb n="308"/>											
changed promptly into a laugh. “Bless my soul! the 
plagued thing went right into the earth beneath me.”</p>
                  <p>“Damn you, it went into my leg,” retorted a 
hoarse voice that fell suddenly silent.</p>
                  <p>With a shiver Dan lay down on the carpet of 
rotted pine-cones and peered, like a squirrel, through 
the meshes of the brushwood. At first he saw only 
gray smoke and a long sweep of briers and 
broom-sedge, standing out dimly from an obscurity 
that was thick as dusk. Then came a clatter near at 
hand, and a battery swept at a long gallop across the 
thinned edge of the pines. So close it came that he 
saw the flashing white eyeballs and the spreading 
sorrel manes of the horses, and almost felt their hot 
breath upon his cheek. He heard the shouts of the 
outriders, the crack of the stout whips, the rattle of 
the caissons, and, before it passed, he had caught the 
excited gestures of the men upon the guns. The 
battery unlimbered, as he watched it, shot a few 
rounds from the summit of the hill, and retreated 
rapidly to a new position. When the wind scattered 
the heavy smoke, he saw only the broom-sedge and 
several ridges of poor corn; some of the gaunt stalks 
blackened and beaten to the ground, some still 
flaunting their brave tassels beneath the whistling 
bullets. It was all in sunlight, and the gray smoke 
swept ceaselessly to and fro over the smiling face of 
the field.</p>
                  <p>Then, as he turned a little in his shelter, he 
saw that there was a single Confederate battery in 
position under a slight swell on his left. Beyond it he 
knew that the long slope sank gently into a marshy
<pb n="309"/>											
stream and the broad turnpike, but the brow of the 
hill went up against the sky, and hidden in the 
brushwood he could see only the darkened line of the 
horizon. Against it the guns stood there in the 
sunlight, unsupported, solitary, majestic, while 
around them the earth was tossed up in the air as if a 
loose plough had run wild across the field. A 
handful of artillerymen moved back and forth, like 
dim outlines, serving the guns in a group of fallen 
horses that showed in dark mounds upon the hill. 
From time to time he saw a rammer waved excitedly 
as a shot went home, or heard, in a lull, the hoarse 
voices of the gunners when they called for “grape!”</p>
                  <p>As he lay there, with his eyes on the solitary 
battery, he forgot, for an instant, his own part in the 
coming work. A bullet cut the air above him, and a 
branch, clipped as by a razor's stroke, fell upon his 
head; but his nerves had grown steady and his 
thoughts were not of himself; he was watching, with 
breathless interest, for another of the gray shadows 
at the guns to go down among the fallen horses.</p>
                  <p>Then, while he watched, he saw other batteries come 
out upon the hill; saw the cannon thrown into 
position and heard the call change from “grape!” to 
“canister!” On the edge of the pines a voice was 
speaking, and beyond the voice a man on horseback 
was riding quietly back and forth in the open. Behind 
him Jack Powell called out suddenly, “We're ready, 
Colonel Burwell!” and his voice was easy, familiar, 
almost affectionate.</p>
                  <p>“I know it, boys!” replied the Colonel in the
<pb n="310"/>											
same tone, and Dan felt a quick sympathy spring up 
within him. At that instant he knew that he loved 
every man in the regiment beside him—loved the 
affectionate Colonel, with the sleepy voice, loved 
Pinetop, loved the lieutenant whose nose he had 
broken after drill. </p>
                  <p>At a word he had leaped, with the others, to his 
feet, and stood drawn up for battle against the wood. 
Then it was that he saw the General of the day riding 
beside fluttering colours across the waste land to the 
crest of the hill. He was rallying the scattered 
brigades about the flag—so the fight had gone 
against them and gone badly, after all.</p>
                  <p>Around him the men drifted back, frightened, 
straggling, defeated, and the broken ranks closed up 
slowly. The standards dipped for a moment before a 
sharp fire, and then, as the colour bearers shook out 
the bright folds, soared like great red birds' wings 
above the smoke. </p>
                  <p>It seemed to Dan that he stood for hours 
motionless there against the pines. For a time the 
fight passed away from him, and he remembered a 
mountain storm which had caught him as a boy in 
the woods at Chericoke. He heard again the cloud 
burst overhead, the soughing of the pines and the 
crackling of dried branches as they came drifting 
down through interlacing boughs. The old childish 
terror returned to him, and he recalled his mad rush 
for light and space when he had doubled like a hare 
in the wooded twilight among the dim bodies of the 
trees. Then as now it was not the open that he feared, 
but the unseen horror of the shelter.</p>
                  <p>Again the affectionate voice came from the 
<pb n="311"/>											
sunlight and he gripped his musket as he started 
forward. He had caught only the last words, and he 
repeated them half mechanically, as he stepped out 
from the brushwood. Once again, when he stood on 
the trampled broom-sedge, he said them over with a 
nervous jerk, “Wait until they come within fifty 
yards—and, for God's sake, boys, shoot at the 
knees!”</p>
                  <p>He thought of the jolly Colonel, and laughed 
hysterically. Why, he had been at that man's 
wedding—had kissed his bride—and now he was 
begging him to shoot at people's knees!</p>
                  <p>With a cheer, the regiment broke from cover and 
swept forward toward the summit of the hill. Dan's 
foot caught in a blackberry vine, and he stumbled 
blindly. As he regained himself a shell ripped up the 
ground before him, flinging the warm clods of earth 
into his face. A “worm” fence at a little distance 
scattered beneath the fire, and as he looked up he 
saw the long rails flying across the field. For an 
instant he hesitated; then something that was like a 
nervous spasm shook his heart, and he was no more 
afraid. Over the blackberries and the broom-sedge, 
on he went toward the swirls of golden dust that 
swept upward from the bright green slope. If this 
was a battle, what was the old engraving? Where 
were the prancing horses and the uplifted swords?</p>
                  <p>Something whistled in his ears and the air was 
filled with sharp sounds that set his teeth on edge. A 
man went down beside him and clutched at his boots 
as he ran past; but the smell of the battle—a smell 
of oil and smoke, of blood and sweat—was
<pb n="312"/>											
in his nostrils, and he could have kicked the stiff 
hands grasping at his feet. The hot old blood of his 
fathers had stirred again and the dead had rallied to 
the call of their descendant. He was not afraid, for 
he had been here long before.</p>
                  <p>Behind him, and beside him, row after row of gray 
men leaped from the shadow—the very hill seemed 
rising to his support—and it was almost gayly, as 
the dead fighters lived again, that he went straight 
onward over the sunny field. He saw the golden dust 
float nearer up the slope, saw the brave flags 
unfurling in the breeze—saw, at last, man after man 
emerge from the yellow cloud. As he bent to fire, the 
fury of the game swept over him and aroused the 
sleeping brute within him. All the primeval instincts, 
throttled by the restraint of centuries—the instincts 
of bloodguiltiness, of hot pursuit, of the fierce 
exhilaration of the chase, of the death grapple with a 
resisting foe—these awoke suddenly to life and 
turned the battle scarlet to his eyes. </p>
                  <p>Two hours later, when the heavy clouds were 
smothering the sunset, he came slowly back across 
the field. A gripping nausea had seized upon him—a 
nausea such as he had known before after that merry 
night at college. His head throbbed, and as he 
walked he staggered like a drunken man. The 
revulsion of his overwrought emotions had thrown 
him into a state of sensibility almost hysterical.</p>
                  <p>The battle-field stretched grimly round him, and 
as the sunset was blotted out, a gray mist crept
<pb n="313"/>											
	
slowly from the west. Here and there he saw men looking 
for the wounded, and he heard one utter an impatient         
“Pshaw!” as he lifted a half-cold body and let it fall. Rude 
stretchers went by him on either side, and still the field 
seemed as thickly sown as before; on the left, where a 
regiment of Zouaves had been cut down, there was a flash 
of white and scarlet, as if the loose grass was strewn with 
great tropical flowers. Among them he saw the reproachful 
eyes of dead and dying horses.</p>
                  <p>Before him, on the gradual slope of the hill, stood a group 
of abandoned guns, and there was something almost human 
in the pathos of their utter isolation. Around them the 
ground was scorched and blackened, and scattered over the 
broken trails lay the men who had fallen at their post. He 
saw them lying there in the fading daylight, with the 
sponges and the rammers still in their hands, and he saw 
upon each man's face the look with which he had met and 
recognized the end. Some were smiling, some staring, and 
one lay grinning as if at a ghastly joke. Near him a boy, 
with the hair still damp on his forehead, had fallen upon an 
uprooted blackberry vine, and the purple stain of the 
berries was on his mouth. As Dan looked down upon him, 
the smell of powder and burned grass came to him with a 
wave of sickness, and turning he stumbled on across the 
field. At the first step his foot struck upon something hard, 
and, picking it up, he saw that it was a Minie ball, which, 
in passing through a man's spine, had been transformed 
into a mass of mingled bone and lead. With a gesture of 
disgust he dropped it and went on rapidly. A stretcher moved
<pb n="314"/>											
beside him, and the man on it, shot through the 
waist, was saying in a whisper, “It is cold—cold -
so cold.” Against his will, Dan found, he had fallen 
into step with the men who bore the stretcher, and 
together they kept time to the words of the wounded 
soldier who cried out ceaselessly that it was cold. On 
their way they passed a group on horseback and, 
standing near it, a handsome artilleryman, who wore 
a red flannel shirt with one sleeve missing. As Dan 
went on he discovered that he was thinking of the 
handsome man in the red shirt and wondering how 
he had lost his missing sleeve. He pondered the 
question as if it were a puzzle, and, finally, yielded it 
up in doubt.</p>
                  <p>Beyond the base of the hill they came into the 
small ravine which had been turned into a rude field 
hospital. Here the stretcher was put down, and a 
tired-looking surgeon, wiping his hands upon a 
soiled towel, came and knelt down beside the 
wounded man.</p>
                  <p>“Bring a light—I can't see—bring a light!” he 
exclaimed irritably, as he cut away the clothes with 
gentle fingers.</p>
                  <p>Dan was passing on, when he heard his name 
called from behind, and turning quickly found 
Governor Ambler anxiously regarding him.</p>
                  <p>“You're not hurt, my boy?” asked the Governor, 
and from his tone he might have parted from the 
younger man only the day before.</p>
                  <p>“Hurt? Oh, no, I'm not hurt,” replied Dan a little 
bitterly, “but there's a whole field of them back 
there, Colonel.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I suppose so—I suppose so,” returned
<pb n="315"/>											
the other absently. “I'm looking after my men now, 
poor fellows. A victory doesn't come cheap, you 
know, and thank God, it was a glorious victory.”</p>
                  <p>“A glorious victory,” repeated Dan, looking at 
the surgeons who were working by the light of 
tallow candles.</p>
                  <p>The Governor followed his gaze. “It's your first 
fight,” he said, “and you haven't learned your lesson 
as I learned mine in Mexico. The best, or the worst 
of it, is that after the first fight it comes easy, my 
boy, it comes too easy.”</p>
                  <p>There was hot blood in him also, thought Dan, as 
he looked at him—and yet of all the men that he had 
ever known he would have called the Governor the 
most humane.</p>
                  <p>“I dare say—I'll get used to it, sir,” he answered. 
“Yes, it was a glorious victory.”</p>
                  <p>He broke away and went off into the twilight over 
the wide meadow to the little wayside spring. Across 
the road there was a field of clover, where a few 
campfires twinkled, and he hastened toward it eager 
to lie down in the darkness and fall asleep. As his 
feet sank in the moist earth, he looked down and saw 
that the little purple flower was still blooming in the 
mud.</p>

                  <head>AFTER THE BATTLE</head>
                  <p>THE field of trampled clover looked as if a windstorm 
had swept over it, strewing the contents of a dozen 
dismantled houses. There were stacks of arms and piles 
of cooking utensils, knapsacks, half emptied, lay beside 
the charred remains of fires, and loose fence rails 
showed red and white glimpses of playing cards, hidden, 
before the fight, by superstitious soldiers.</p>
                  <p>Groups of men were scattered in dark spots over the 
field, and about them stragglers drifted slowly back 
from the road to Centreville. There was no discipline, 
no order—regiment was mixed with regiment, and each 
man was hopelessly inquiring for his lost company.</p>
                  <p>As Dan stepped over the fallen fence upon the 
crushed pink heads of the clover, he came upon a 
circle of privates making merry over a lunch basket 
they had picked up on the turnpike—a basket 
brought by one of the Washington parties who had 
gayly driven out to watch the battle. A broken fence 
rail was ablaze in the centre of the group, and as the 
red light fell on each soiled and unshaven face, it 
stood out grotesquely from the surrounding gloom. 
Some were slightly wounded, some had merely 
scented the battle from behind the hill—all were
<pb n="317"/>										
drinking rare wine in honour of the early ending of the 
war. As Dan looked past them over the darkening 
meadow, where the returning soldiers drifted aimlessly 
across the patches of red light, he asked himself almost 
impatiently if this were the pure and patriotic army that 
held in its ranks the best born of the South? To him, 
standing there, it seemed but a loosened mass, without 
strength and without cohesion, a mob of schoolboys 
come back from a sham battle on the college green. It 
was his first fight, and he did not know that what he 
looked upon was but the sure result of an easy victory 
upon the undisciplined ardour of raw troops—that the 
sinews of an army are wrought not by a single trial, but 
by the strain of prolonged and strenuous endeavour.</p>
                  <p>“I say, do you reckon they'll lemme go home 
termorrow?” inquired a slightly wounded man in the 
group before him. “Thar's my terbaccy needs lookin' 
arter or the worms 'ull eat it clean up 'fo' I git thar.”  
He shook the shaggy hair from his face, and straightened 
the white cotton bandage about his chin. On the right 
side, where the wound was, his thick sandy beard had 
been cut away, and the outstanding tuft on his left cheek 
gave him a peculiarly ill-proportioned look.</p>
                  <p>“Lordy! I tell you we gave it ter 'em!” exclaimed 
another in excited jerks. “Fight! Wall, that's what I call 
fightin', leastways it's put. I declar' I reckon I hit six 
Yankees plum on the head with the butt of this here 
musket.”</p>
                  <p>He paused to knock the head off a champagne bottle, 
and lifting the broken neck to his lips drained the 
foaming wine, which spilled in white froth upon
<pb n="318"/>											
his clothes. His face was red in the firelight, and 
when he spoke his words rolled like marbles from 
his tongue. Dan, looking at him, felt a curious 
conviction that the man had not gone near enough to 
the guns to smell the powder.</p>
                  <p>“Wall, it may be so, but I ain't seed you,” returned 
the first speaker, contemptuously, as he stroked his 
bandage. “I was thar all day and I ain't seed you 
raise no special dust.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I ain't claimin' nothin' special,” put in the 
other, discomfited.</p>
                  <p>“Six is a good many, I reckon,” drawled the 
wounded man, reflectively, “and I ain't say sayin' I 
settled six on 'em hand to hand—I ain't sayin' that.” 
He spoke with conscious modesty, as if the 
smallness of his assertion was equalled only by the 
greatness of his achievements. “I ain't sayin' I 
settled more'n three on 'em, I reckon.”</p>
                  <p>Dan left the group and went on slowly across the 
field, now and then stumbling upon a sleeper who 
lay prone upon the trodden clover, obscured by the 
heavy dusk. The mass of the army was still 
somewhere on the long road—only the exhausted, 
the sickened, or the unambitious drifted back to fall 
asleep upon the uncovered ground.</p>
                  <p>As Dan crossed the meadow he drew near to a 
knot of men from a Kentucky regiment, gathered in 
the light of a small wood fire, and recognizing one of 
them, he stopped to inquire for news of his missing 
friends.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you wouldn't know your sweetheart on a 
night like this,” replied the man he knew—a big 
handsome fellow, with a peculiar richness of voice.</p>
                  <pb n="319"/>
                  <p>“Find a hole, Montjoy, and go to sleep in it, that's 
my advice. Were you much cut up?”</p>
                  <p>“I don't know,” answered Dan, uneasily. “I'm 
trying to make sure that we were not. I lost the others 
somewhere on the road—a horse knocked me down.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, if this is to be the last battle, I shouldn't 
mind a scratch myself,” put in a voice from the darkness,       
“even if it's nothing more than a bruise from a horse's 
hoof. By the bye, Montjoy, did you see the way Stuart 
rode down the Zouaves? I declare the slope looked like 
a field of poppies in full bloom. Your cousin was in 
that charge, I believe, and he came out whole. I saw 
him afterwards.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, the cavalry gets the best of everything,” 
said Dan, with a sigh, and he was passing on, when Jack 
Powell, coming out of the darkness, stumbled against 
him, and broke into a delighted laugh.</p>
                  <p>“Why, bless my soul, Beau, I thought you'd run 
after the fleshpots of Washington!” His face was flushed 
with excitement and the soft curls upon his forehead 
were wet and dark. Around his mouth there was a black 
stain from bitten cartridges. “By George, it was a jolly 
day, wasn't it, old man?” he added warmly.</p>
                  <p>“Where are the others?” asked Dan, grasping his 
arm in an almost frantic pressure.</p>
                  <p>“The others? they're all right—all except poor 
Welch, who got a ball in his thigh, you know. Did you 
see him when he was taken off the field? He laughed as 
he passed me and shouted back that he‘was always 
willing to spare a leg or two to the cause!’”</p>
                  <pb n="320"/>
                  <p>“Where are you off to?” inquired Dan, 
still grasping his arm.</p>
                  <p>“I? oh, I'm on the scent of water. I haven't 
learned to sleep dirty yet, which Bland says is a sign 
I'm no soldier. By the way, your darky, Big Abel, has a 
coffee-boiler over yonder in the fence corner. He's 
been tearing his wool out over your absence; you'd 
better ease his mind.” With a laugh and a wave of his 
hand, he plunged into the darkness, and Dan made 
his way slowly to the campfire, which twinkled from 
the old rail fence. As he groped toward it curses 
sprang up like mustard from the earth beneath. “Get 
off my leg, and be damned,” growled a voice under 
his feet. “Oh, this here ain't no pesky jedgment day,” 
exclaimed another just ahead. Without answering he 
stepped over the dark bodies, and, ten minutes later, 
came upon Big Abel waiting patiently beside the 
dying fire.</p>
                  <p>At sight of him the negro leaped, with a shout, to his 
feet; then, recovering himself, hid his joy beneath an 
accusing mask.</p>
                  <p>“Dis yer coffee hit's done 'mos' bile away,” he 
remarked gloomily. “En ef'n it don' tase like hit 
oughter tase, 'tain' no use ter tu'n up yo' nose, caze 
'tain' de faul' er de coffee, ner de faul' er me nurr.”</p>
                  <p>“How are you, old man?” asked Bland, turning 
over in the shadow. </p>
                  <p>“Who's there?” responded Dan, as he peered 
from the light into the obscurity.</p>
                  <p>“All the mess except Welch, poor devil. Baker 
got his hair singed by our rear line, and he says he 
thinks it's safer to mix with the Yankees next
<pb n="321"/>											
time. Somebody behind him shot his cowlick clean
 off.”</p>
                  <p>“Cowlick, the mischief!” retorted Baker, 
witheringly.   “Why, my scalp is as bald as your hand. 
The fool shaved me like a barber.”</p>
                  <p>“It's a pity he didn't aim at your whiskers,” was 
Dan's rejoinder. “The chief thing I've got against this 
war is that when it's over there won't be a 
smooth-shaven man in the South.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, we'll stand them up before our rear line,”  
suggested Baker, moodily. “You may laugh, Bland, but 
you wouldn't like it yourself, and if they keep up their 
precious marksmanship your turn will come yet. We'll be 
a regiment of baldheads before Christmas.”</p>
                  <p>Dan sat down upon the blanket Big Abel had spread 
and leaned heavily upon his knapsack, which the negro 
had picked up on the roadside. A nervous chill had 
come over him and he was shaking with icy starts from 
head to foot. Big Abel brought a cup of coffee, and as 
he took it from him, his hand quivered so that he set the 
cup upon the ground; then he lifted it and drank the hot 
coffee in long draughts.</p>
                  <p>“I should have lost my very identity but for you, 
Big Abel,” he observed gratefully, as he glanced round at 
the property the negro had protected.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel leaned forward and stirred the ashes with a 
small stick.</p>
                  <p>“En I done fit fer 'em, suh,” he replied. “I des tell 
you all de fittin' ain' been over yonder on dat ar hill 
caze I'se done fit right yer in dis yer fence conder, en I 
ain' fit de Yankees nurr. Lawd, Lawd,
<pb n="322"/>

But dese yer sodgers!—Why, you cyarn tu'n yo' eye 
a splinter off de vittles fo' dey's done got 'em. Dey 
poke dey han's right spang in de fire en eat de ashes 
en all.”</p>
                  <p>He went off grumbling to lie down at a little 
distance, and Dan sat thoughtfully looking into the 
smouldering fire. Bland and Baker, having heatedly 
discussed the details of the victory, had at last 
drifted into silence; only Pinetop was awake—this he 
learned from the odour of the corncob pipe which 
floated from a sheltered corner.</p>
                  <p>“Come over, Pinetop,” called Dan, cordially.       
“and let's make ready for the pursuit to-morrow. 
Why, to-morrow we may eat a civilized dinner in 
Washington—think of that!”</p>
                  <p>He spoke excitedly, for he was still quivering 
from the tumult of his thoughts. There was no sleep 
possible for him just now; his limbs twitched 
restlessly, and he felt the prick of strong emotion in 
his blood.</p>
                  <p>“I say, Pinetop, what do you think of the fight?” 
he asked with an embarrassed boyish eagerness. In 
the faint light of the fire his eyes burned like coals 
and there was a thick black stain around his mouth. 
The hand in which he had held his ramrod was of a 
dark rust colour, as if the stain of the battle had 
seared into the skin. A smell of hot powder still hung 
about his clothes.</p>
                  <pb n="323"/>
                  <p>The mountaineer left the shadow of the fence 
corner and slowly dragged himself into the little 
glow, where he sat puffing at his corncob pipe. He 
gave an easy, sociable nod and stared silently at the 
embers.</p>
                  <p>“Was it just what you imagined it would be?” 
went on Dan, curiously.</p>
                  <p>Pinetop took his pipe from his mouth and nodded 
again. “Wall, 'twas and 'twan't,” he answered 
pleasantly.</p>
                  <p>“I must say it made me sick,” admitted Dan, 
leaning his head in his hand. “I've always been a 
fool about the smell of blood; and it made me 
downright sick.”</p>
                  <p>“Wall, I ain't got much of a stomach for a fight 
myself,” returned Pinetop, reflectively. “You see I 
ain't never fought anythin' bigger'n a skunk until 
to-day; and when I stood out thar with them bullets 
sizzlin'  like fryin' pans round my head, I kind of 
says to myself: ‘Look here, what's all this fuss 
about anyhow? If these here folks have come arter 
the niggers, let 'em take 'em off and welcome.’ I ain't 
never owned a nigger in my life, and, what's more, I 
ain't never seen one that's worth owning. ‘Let 'em 
take 'em and welcome,’ that's what I said. Bless your 
life, as I stood out thar I didn't see how I was goin' 
to fire my musket, till all of a jiffy a thought jest 
jumped into my head and sent me bangin' down that 
hill. ‘Them folks have set thar feet on ole Virginny,’ 
was what I thought. ‘They've set thar feet on ole 
Virginny, and they've got to take 'em off damn 
quick!’”</p>
                  <p>His teeth closed over his pipe as if it were a 
<pb n="324"/>											
cartridge; then, after a silent moment, he opened his 
mouth and spoke again.</p>
                  <p>“What I can't make out for the life of me,” he said,  
“is how those boys from the other states gave thar 
licks so sharp. If I'd been born across the line in 
Tennessee, I wouldn't have fired my musket off 
to-day. They wan't a-settin' thar feet on Tennessee. 
But ole Virginny—wall, I've got a powerful fancy 
for ole Virginny, and they ain't goin' to project with 
her dust, if I can stand between.” He turned away, 
and, emptying his pipe, rolled over upon the ground.</p>
                  <p>Dan lay down upon the blanket, and, with his hand 
upon his knapsack, gazed at the small red ember 
burning amid the ashes. When the last spark faded 
into blackness it was as if his thoughts went groping 
for a light. Sleep came fitfully in flights and pauses, 
in broken dreams and brief awakenings. Losing 
himself at last it was only to return to the woods at 
Chericoke and to see Betty coming to him among the 
dim blue bodies of the trees. He saw the faint 
sunshine falling upon her head and the stir of the 
young leaves above her as a light wind passed. 
Under her feet the grass was studded with violets, 
and the bonnet swinging from her arm was filled 
with purple blossoms. She came on steadily over the 
path of grass and violets, but when he reached out to 
touch her a great shame fell over him for there was 
blood upon his hand.</p>
                  <p>There was something cold in his face, and he 
emerged slowly from his sleep into the consciousness 
of dawn and a heavy rain. The swollen clouds hung 
close above the hills, and the distance was obscured
<pb n="325"/>											 
by the gray sheets of water which fell like a curtain 
from heaven to earth. Near by a wagon had drawn 
up in the night, and he saw that a group of 
half-drenched privates had already taken shelter 
between the wheels. Gathering up his oilcloth, he 
hastily formed a tent with the aid of a deep fence 
corner, and, when he had drawn his blanket across 
the opening, sat partly protected from the shower. 
As the damp air blew into his face, he became 
quickly and clearly awake, and it was with the 
glimmer of a smile that he looked over the wet 
meadow and the sleeping regiments. Then a shudder 
followed, for he saw in the lines of gray men 
stretched beneath the rain some likeness to that other 
field beyond the hill where the dead were still lying, 
row on row. He saw them stark and cold on the 
scorched grass beside the guns, or in the thin ridges 
of trampled corn, where the gay young tassels were 
now storm-beaten upon the ripped-up earth. He saw 
them as he had seen them the evening before—not in 
the glow of battle, but with the acuteness of a 
brooding sympathy—saw them frowning, smiling, 
and with features which death had twisted into a 
ghastly grin. They were all there—each man with 
open eyes and stiff hands grasping the clothes above 
his wound.</p>
                  <p>But to Dan, sitting in the gray dawn in the fence 
corner, the first horror faded quickly into an emotion 
almost triumphant. The great field was silent, 
reproachful, filled with accusing eyes—but was it 
not filled with glory, too? He was young, and his 
weakened pulses quickened at the thought. Since 
men must die, where was a brighter death than to
<pb n="326"/>											
fall beneath the flutter of the colours, with the 
thunder of the cannon in one's ears? He knew now why 
his fathers had loved a fight, had loved the glitter of the 
bayonets and the savage smell of the discoloured earth.</p>
                  <p>For a moment the old racial spirit flashed above the 
peculiar sensitiveness which had come to him from his 
childhood and his suffering mother; then the flame went 
out and the rows of dead men stared at him through the 
falling rain in the deserted field.</p>

                  <head>THE WOMAN 'S PART</head>
                  <p>AT sunrise on the morning of the battle Betty 
and Virginia, from the whitewashed porch of a 
little railway inn near Manassas, watched the 
Governor's regiment as it marched down the 
single street and into the red clay road. 
Through the first faint sunshine, growing 
deeper as the sun rose gloriously above the 
hills, there sounded a peculiar freshness in the 
martial music as it triumphantly floated back 
across the fields. To Betty it almost seemed 
that the drums were laughing as they went to 
battle; and when the gay air at last faded in the 
distance, the silence closed about her with a 
strangeness she had never felt before—as if the 
absence of sound was grown melancholy, like 
the absence of light.</p>
                  <p>She shut her eyes and brought—back the long gray line 
passing across the sunbeams: the tanned eager faces, the 
waving flags, the rapid, almost impatient tread of the men 
as they swung onward. A laugh had run along the column 
as it went by her and she had smiled in quick sympathy 
with some foolish jest. It was all so natural to her, the 
gayety and the ardour and the invincible dash of the 
young army—it was all so like the spirit of Dan and so 
dear to her because of the likeness.</p>
                  <pb n="328"/>
                  <p>Somewhere—not far away, she knew—he also 
was stepping briskly across the first sun rays, and 
her heart followed him even while she smiled down 
upon the regiment before her. It was as if her soul 
were suddenly freed from her bodily presence, and in 
a kind of dual consciousness she seemed to be 
standing upon the little whitewashed porch and 
walking onward beside Dan at the same moment. 
The wonder of it glowed in her rapt face, and 
Virginia, turning to put some trivial question, was 
startled by the passion of her look.</p>
                  <p>“Have—have you seen—some one, Betty?” 
she whispered.</p>
                  <p>The charm was snapped and Betty fell back into 
time and place.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, yes, I have seen—some one,” her voice 
thrilled as she spoke. “I saw him as clearly as I see 
you; he was all in sunshine and there was a flag 
close above his head. He looked up and smiled at 
me. Yes, I saw him! I saw him!”</p>
                  <p>“It was Dan,” said Virginia—not as a question, 
but in a wondering assent. “Why, Betty, I thought 
you had forgotten Dan—papa thought so, too.”</p>
                  <p>“Forgotten!” exclaimed Betty scornfully. She fell 
away from the crowd and Virginia followed her. The 
two stood leaning against the whitewashed wall in the 
dust that still rose from the street. “So you thought I 
had forgotten him,” said Betty again. She raised her 
hand to her bosom and crushed the lace upon her 
dress. “Well, you were wrong,” she added quietly.</p>
                  <p>Virginia looked at her and smiled. “I am almost 
glad,” she answered in her sweet girlish voice. “I
<pb n="329"/>											
don't like to have Dan forgotten even if—if he ought 
to be.”</p>
                  <p>“I didn't love him because he ought to be loved,” 
said Betty. “I loved him because I couldn't help 
it—because he was himself and I was myself, I 
suppose. I was born to love him, and to stop loving 
him I should have to be born again. I don't care what 
he does—I don't care what he is even—I would 
rather love him than—than be a queen.” She held 
her hands tightly together. “I would be his servant if 
he would let me,” she went on. “I would work for 
him like a slave—but he won't let me. And yet he 
does love me just the same—just the same.”</p>
                  <p>“He does—he does,” admitted Virginia softly. She 
had never seen Betty like this before, and she felt 
that her sister had become suddenly very strange 
and very sacred. Her hands were outstretched to 
comfort, but Betty turned gently away from her and 
went up the narrow staircase to the bare little room 
where the girls slept together.</p>
                  <p>Alone within the four white walls she moved 
breathlessly to and fro like a woodland creature that 
has been entrapped. At the moment she was telling 
herself that she wanted to keep onward with the 
army; then her courage would have fluttered upward 
like the flags. It was not the sound of the cannon 
that she dreaded, nor the sight of blood—these 
would have nerved her as they nerved the 
generations at her back—but the folded hands and 
the terrible patience that are the woman's share of a 
war. The old fighting blood was in her veins—she 
was as much the child of her father as a son could
<pb n="330"/>											
have been—and yet while the great world over 
there was filled with noise she was told to go into 
her room and pray. Pray! Why, a man might pray 
with his musket in his hand, that was worth while.</p>
                  <p>In the adjoining room she saw her mother sitting 
in a square of sunlight with her open Bible on her 
knees.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, speak, mamma!” she called half angrily.     
“Move, do anything but sit so still. I can't bear it!” 
She caught her breath sharply, for with her words a 
low sound like distant thunder filled the room and 
the little street outside. As she clung with both hands 
to the window it seemed to her that a gray haze had 
fallen over the sunny valley. “Some one is dead,” 
she said almost calmly, “that killed how many?”</p>
                  <p>The room stifled her and she ran hurriedly down 
into the street, where a few startled women and old 
men had rushed at the first roll of the cannon. As she 
stood among them, straining her eyes from end to 
end of the little village, her heart beat in her throat 
and she could only quaver out an appeal for news.</p>
                  <p>“Where is it? Doesn't any one know anything? 
What does it mean?”</p>
                  <p>“It means a battle, Miss, that's one thing,” 
remarked on obliging by-stander who leaned heavily 
upon a wooden leg. “Bless you, I kin a'most taste the 
powder.” He smacked his lips and spat into the dust. 
“To think that I went all the way down to Mexico 
fur a fight,” he pursued regretfully, “when I could 
have set tight here at home and had it all
<pb n="331"/>											
in old Virginny. Well, well, that comes of hurryin' 
the Lord afo' he's ready.”</p>
                  <p>He rambled on excitedly, but Betty, frowning 
with impatience, turned from him and walked rapidly up 
and down the single street, where the voices of the 
guns growled through the muffling distance. “That 
killed how many? how many?” she would say at 
each long roll, and again, “How many died that 
moment, and was one Dan?”</p>
                  <p>Up and down the little village, through the 
heavy sunshine and the white dust, among the whimpering 
women and old men, she walked until the day wore 
on and the shadows grew longer across the street. 
Once a man had come with the news of a sharp 
repulse, and in the early afternoon a deserter 
straggled in with the cry that the enemy was 
marching upon the village. It was not until the night 
had fallen, when the wounded began to arrive on 
baggage trains, that the story of the day was told, 
and a single shout went up from the waiting groups. 
The Confederacy was established! Washington was 
theirs by right of arms, and tomorrow the young 
army would dictate terms of peace to a great nation! 
The flags waved, women wept, and the wounded 
soldiers, as they rolled in on baggage cars, were 
hailed as the deliverers of a people. The new 
Confederacy! An emotion half romantic, half 
maternal filled Betty as she bent above an open 
wound—for it was in her blood to do battle to the 
death for a belief, to throw herself into a cause as 
into the arms of a lover. She was made of the stuff 
of soldiers, and come what might she would always 
take her stand upon her people's side.</p>
                  <pb n="332"/>
                  <p>There were cheers and sobs in the little street 
about her; in the distance a man was shouting for the 
flag, and nearer by a woman with a lantern in her 
hand was searching among the living for her dead. 
The joy and the anguish of it entered into the girl like 
wine. She felt her pulses leap and a vigour that was 
not her own nerved her from head to foot. With that 
power of ardent sacrifice which lies beneath all 
shams in the Southern heart, she told herself that no 
endurance was too great, no hope too large with 
which to serve the cause.</p>
                  <p>The exaltation was still with her when, a little 
later, she went up to her room and knelt down to 
thank God. Her people's simple faith was hers also, 
and as she prayed with her brow on her clasped 
hands it was as if she gave thanks to some great 
warrior who had drawn his sword in defence of the 
land she loved. God was on her side, supreme, 
beneficent, watchful in little things, as He has been 
on the side of all fervent hearts since the beginning of 
time.</p>
                  <p>But after her return do Uplands in midsummer 
she suffered a peculiar restlessness from the 
tranquil August weather. The long white road 
irritated her with its aspect of listless patience, 
and at times she wanted to push back the crowding 
hills and leave the horizon open to her view. When 
a squadron of cavalry swept along the turnpike her 
heart would follow it like a bird while she leaned, 
with straining eyes, against a great white column. Then, 
as the last rider was blotted out into the landscape, 
she would clasp her hands and walk rapidly
<pb n="333"/>											
up and down between the lilacs. It was all waiting 
—waiting—waiting—nothing else.</p>
                  <p>“Something must happen, mamma, or I shall go 
mad,” she said one day, breaking in upon Mrs. 
Ambler as she sorted a heap of old letters in the 
library.</p>
                  <p>“But what? What?” asked Virginia from the shadow of 
the window seat. “Surely you don't want a battle, 
Betty?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler shuddered.</p>
                  <p>“Don't tempt Providence, dear,” she said 
seriously, untying a faded ribbon about a piece of old 
parchment. “Be grateful for just this calm and go 
out for a walk. You might take this pitcher of 
flaxseed tea to Floretta's cabin, if you've nothing else 
to do. Ask how the baby is to-day, and tell her to 
keep the red flannel warm on its chest.”</p>
                  <p>Betty went into the hall after her bonnet and came 
back for the pitcher. “I'm going—to walk across the 
fields to Chericoke,” she said, “and Hosea is to 
bring the carriage for me about sunset. We must 
have some white silk to make those flags out of, and 
there isn't a bit in the house.”</p>
                  <p>She went out, stepping slowly in her wide skirts 
and holding the pitcher carefully before her.</p>
                  <p>Floretta's baby was sleeping, and after a 
few pleasant words the girl kept on to Chericoke. 
There she found that the Major had gone to town 
for news, leaving Mrs. Lightfoot to her pickle 
making in the big storeroom, where the earthenware 
jars stood in clean brown rows upon the shelves. 
The air was sharp with the smell of vinegar and 
spices, and fragrant moisture dripped from the 
old lady's delicate hands. At the moment she
<pb n="334"/>											
had forgotten the war just beyond her doors, and 
even the vacant places in her household; her nervous 
flutter was caused by finding the plucked corn too 
large to salt.</p>
                  <p>“Come in, child, come in,” she said, as Betty 
appeared in the doorway. “You're too good a 
housekeeper to mind the smell of brine.”</p>
                  <p>“How the soldiers will enjoy it,” laughed Betty in 
reply. “It's fortunate that both sides are fond of 
spices.”</p>
                  <p>The old lady was tying a linen cloth over the 
mouth of a great brown jar, and she did not look up 
as she answered. “I'm not consulting their tastes, my 
dear, though, as for that, I'm willing enough to feast 
our own men so long as the Yankees keep away. 
This jar, by the bye, is filled with ‘Confederate 
pickle’—it was as little as I could do to compliment 
the Government, I thought, and the green tomato 
catchup I've named in honour of General 
Beauregard.”</p>
                  <p>Betty smiled; and then, while Mrs. Lightfoot stood 
sharply regarding Car'line, who was shucking a tray 
of young corn, she timidly began upon her mission.  
“The flags must be finished, and I can't find the silk,” 
she pleaded. “Isn't there a scrap in the house I may 
have? Let me look about the attic.”</p>
                  <p>The old lady shook her head. “I haven't allowed 
anybody to set foot in my attic for forty years,” she 
replied decisively. “Why, I'd almost as soon they'd 
step into my grandfather's vault.” Then as Betty's 
face fell she added generously. “As for white silk, I 
haven't any except my wedding dress,
<pb n="335"/>											
and that's yellow with age; but you may take it if 
you want it. I'm sure it couldn't come to a better 
end; at least it will have been to the front upon two 
important occasions.”</p>
                  <p>“Your wedding dress!” exclaimed Betty in 
surprise, “oh, how could you?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot smiled grimly.</p>
                  <p>“I could give more than a wedding dress if the 
Confederacy called for it, my dear,” she answered. </p>
                  <p>“Indeed, I'm not perfectly sure that I couldn't give 
the Major himself—but go upstairs and wait for me 
while I send Car'line for the keys.”</p>
                  <p>She returned to the storeroom, and Betty went 
upstairs to wander leisurely through the cool faintly 
lighted chambers. They were all newly swept and 
scented with lavender, and the high tester beds, with 
their slender fluted posts, looked as if they had stood 
spotless and untouched for generations. In Dan's 
room, which had been his mother's also, the girl 
walked slowly up and down, meeting, as she passed, 
her own eyes in the darkened mirror. Her mind 
fretted with the thought that Dan's image had risen 
so often in the glass, and yet had left no hint for her 
as she looked in now. If it had only caught and held 
his reflection, that blank mirror, she could have 
found it, she felt sure, though a dozen faces had 
passed by since. Was there nothing left of him, she 
wondered, nothing in the place where he had lived 
his life? She turned to the bed and picked up, one by 
one, the scattered books upon the little table. Among 
them there was a copy of the “Morte d'Arthur,” and 
as it fell open in her hand, she found a bit of her own
<pb n="336"/>											
blue ribbon between the faded leaves. A tremor ran 
through her limbs, and going to the window she 
placed the book upon the sill and read the words 
aloud in the fragrant stillness. Behind her in the dim 
room Dan seemed to rise as suddenly as a 
ghost—and that high-flown chivalry of his, which 
delighted in sounding phrases as in heroic virtues, 
was loosened from the leaves of the old romance.</p>
                  <p>“For there was never worshipful man nor 
worshipful woman but they loved one better than 
another, and worship in arms may never be foiled; 
but first reserve the honour to God, and secondly the 
quarrel must come of thy lady; and such love I call 
virtuous love.”</p>
                  <p>She leaned her cheek upon the book and looked 
out dreamily into the green box mazes of the garden. 
In the midst of war a great peace had come to her, 
and the quiet summer weather no longer troubled her 
with its unbroken calm. Her heart had grown 
suddenly strong again; even the long waiting had 
become but a fit service for her love.</p>
                  <p>There was a step in the hall and Mrs. Lightfoot 
rustled in with her wedding dress.</p>
                  <p>“You may take it and welcome, child,” she said, 
as she gave it into Betty's arms. “I can't help feeling 
that there was something providential in my selecting 
white when my taste always leaned toward a 
peach-blow brocade. Well, well, who would have 
believed that I was buying a flag as well as a frock? 
If I'd even hinted such a thing, they would have said 
I had the vapours.”</p>
                  <p>Betty accepted the gift with her pretty effusion 
of manner, and went downstairs to where Hosea was
<pb n="337"/>											
waiting for her with the big carriage. As she drove 
home in a happy revery, her eyes dwelt contentedly on 
the sunburnt August fields, and the thought of war did 
not enter in to disturb her dreams.</p>
                  <p>Once a line of Confederate cavalrymen rode by at a 
gallop and saluted her as her face showed at the 
window. They were strangers to her, but with the 
peculiar feeling of kinship which united the people of 
the South, she leaned out to wish them “God speed” as 
she waved her handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>When, a little later, she turned into the drive at 
Uplands, it was to find, from the prints upon the gravel, 
that the soldiers had been there before her. Beyond the 
Doric columns she caught a glimpse of a gray sleeve, 
and for a single instant a, wild hope shot up within her 
heart. Then as the carriage stopped, and she sprang 
quickly to the ground, the man in gray came out upon 
the portico, and she saw that it was Jack Morson.</p>
                  <p>“I've come for Virginia, Betty,” he began 
impulsively, as he took her hand, “and she promises to 
marry me before the battle.”</p>
                  <p>Betty laughed with trembling lips. “And here is the 
dress,” she said gayly, holding out the yellowed silk.</p>

                  <head>VI</head>
                  <head>ON THE ROAD TO ROMNEY</head>
                  <p>AFTER a peaceful Christmas, New Year's Day rose 
bright and mild, and Dan as he started from 
Winchester with the column felt that he was 
escaping to freedom from the tedious duties of camp 
life.</p>
                  <p>“Thank God we're on the war-path again,” he 
remarked to Pinetop, who was stalking at his side. 
The two had become close friends during the dull 
weeks after their first battle, and Bland, who had 
brought a taste for the classics from the 
lecture-room, had already referred to them in 
pointless jokes as “Pylades and Orestes.”</p>
                  <p>“It looks mighty like summer,” responded Pinetop 
cheerfully. He threw a keen glance up into the blue 
clouds, and then sniffed suspiciously at the dust that 
rose high in the road. “But I ain't one to put much 
faith in looks,” he added with his usual caution, as 
he shifted the knapsack upon his shoulders.</p>
                  <p>Dan laughed easily. “Well, I'm heartily glad I 
left my overcoat behind me,” he said, breathing hard as 
he climbed the mountain road, where the red clay had 
stiffened into channels.</p>
                  <p>The sunshine fell brightly over them, lying in 
golden drops upon the fallen leaves. To Dan the
<pb n="339"/>											
march brought back the early winter rides at 
Chericoke, and the chain of lights and shadows that 
ran on clear days over the tavern road. Joyously 
throwing back his head, he whistled a love song as 
he tramped up the mountain side. The irksome 
summer, with its slow fevers and its sharp attacks of 
measles, its scarcity of pure water and supplies of 
half-cooked food, was suddenly blotted from his 
thoughts, and his first romantic ardour returned to 
him in long draughts of wind and sun. After each 
depression his elastic temperament had sprung 
upward; the past months had but strengthened him 
in body as in mind.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon a gray cloud came up suddenly 
and the sunshine, after a feeble struggle, was driven 
from the mountains. As the wind blew in short gusts 
down the steep road, Dan tightened his coat and 
looked at Pinetop's knapsack with his unfailing 
laugh.</p>
                  <p>“That's beginning to look comfortable. I hope to 
heaven the wagons aren't far off.”</p>
                  <p>Pinetop turned and glanced back into the valley.   
“I'll be blessed if I believe they're anywhere,” was his 
answer.</p>
                  <p>“Well, if they aren't, I'll be somewhere before 
morning; why, it feels like snow.”</p>
                  <p>A gust of wind, sharp as a blade, struck from the 
gray sky, and whirlpools of dead leaves were swept 
into the forest. Falling silent, Dan swung his arms to 
quicken the current of his blood, and walked on more 
rapidly. Over the long column gloom had settled with 
the clouds, and they were brave lips that offered a 
jest in the teeth of the wind.</p>
                  <pb n="340"/>
                  <p>There were no blankets, few overcoats, and fewer 
rations, and the supply wagons were crawling 
somewhere in the valley.</p>
                  <p>The day wore on, and still the rough country road 
climbed upward embedded in withered leaves. On 
the high wind came the first flakes of a snowstorm, 
followed by a fine rain that enveloped the hills like 
mist. As Dan stumbled on, his feet slipped on the 
wet clay, and he was forced to catch at the bared 
saplings for support. The cold had entered his lungs 
as a knife, and his breath circled in a little cloud 
about his mouth. Through the storm he heard the 
quick oaths of his companions ring out like distant 
shots.</p>
                  <p>When night fell they halted to bivouac by the 
roadside, and until daybreak the pine woods were 
filled with the cheerful glow of the campfires. There 
were no rations, and Dan, making a jest of his 
hunger, had stretched himself in the full light of the 
crackling branches. With the defiant humour which 
had made him the favourite of the mess, he laughed 
at the frozen roads, at the change in the wind, at his 
own struggles with the wet kindling wood, at the 
supply wagons creeping slowly after them. His 
courage had all the gayety of his passions—it 
showed itself in a smile, in a whistle, in the steady 
hand with which he played toss and catch with fate. 
The superb silence of Pinetop, plodding evenly 
along, was as far removed from him as the lofty 
grandeur of the mountains. A jest warmed his heart 
against the cold; with set lips and grave eyes, he 
would have fallen before the next ridge was crossed.</p>
                  <pb n="341"/>
                  <p>Through the woods other fires were burning, and 
long reddish shadows crept among the pine trees 
over the rotting mould. For warmth Dan had spread 
a covering of dried leaves over him, raking them 
from sheltered corners of the forest. When he rose 
from time to time during the night to take his turn at 
replenishing the fire the leaves drifted in gravelike 
mounds about his feet. </p>
                  <p>For three days the march was steadily upward 
over long ridges—coated deep with ice. In the face of 
the strong wind, which blew always down the steep 
road, the army passed on, complaining, cursing, 
asking a gigantic question of its General. Among the 
raw soldiers there had been desertions by the dozen, 
filling the streets of the little town with frost-bitten 
malcontents. “It was all a wild goose chase,” they 
declared bitterly, “and if Old Jack wasn't a March 
hare—well, he was something madder!”</p>
                  <p>Dan listened to the curses with his ready smile, 
and walked on bravely. Since the first evening he 
had uttered no complaint, asked no question. He had 
undertaken to march, and he meant to march, that 
was all. In the front with which he veiled his 
suffering there was no lessening of his old careless 
confidence—if his dash had hardened into endurance 
it wore still an expression that was almost debonair.</p>
                  <p>So as the column straggled weakly upward, he 
wrung his stiffened fingers and joked with Jack 
Powell, who stumbled after him. The cold had 
brought a glow to his tanned face, and when he 
lifted his eyes from the road Pinetop saw that they
<pb n="342"/>											
were shining brightly. Once he slipped on the frozen 
mud, and as his musket dropped from his hand, it 
went off sharply, the load entering the ground.</p>
                  <p>“Are you hurt?” asked Jack, springing toward 
him; but Dan looked round laughing as he clasped 
his knee.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I merely groaned because I might have 
been,” he said lightly, and limped on, singing a bit 
of doggerel which had taken possession of his 
regiment.</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Then let the Yanks say what they will,</l>
                     <l part="N">We'll be gay and happy still;</l>
                     <l part="N">Gay and happy, gay and happy,</l>
                     <l part="N">We'll be gay and happy still.”</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>On the third day out they reached a little village in 
the mountains, but before the week's end they had 
pushed on again, and the white roads still stretched 
before them. As they went higher the tracks grew 
steeper, and now and then a musket shot rang out on 
the roadside as a man lost his footing and went down 
upon the ice. Behind them the wagon train crept inch 
by inch, or waited patiently for hours while a wheel 
was hoisted from the ditch beside the road. There 
was blood on the muzzles of the horses and on the 
shining ice that stretched beyond them.</p>
                  <p>To Dan these terrible days were as the anguish 
of a new birth, in which the thing to be born 
suffered the conscious throes of awakening life. He 
could never be the same again; something was 
altered in him forever; this he felt dimly as he 
dragged his aching body onward. Days like these
<pb n="343"/>											
would prove the stuff that had gone into the making 
of him. When the march to Romney lay behind him 
he should know himself to be either a soldier or a 
coward. A soldier or a coward! he said the words 
over again as he struggled to keep down the pangs 
of hunger, telling himself that the road led not 
merely to Romney, but to a greater victory than his 
General dreamed of. Romney might be worthless, 
after all, the grim march but a mad prank of 
Jackson's, as men said; but whether to lay down 
one's arms or to struggle till the end was reached, 
this was the question asked by those stern 
mountains. Nature stood ranged against him—he 
fought it step by step, and day by day.</p>
                  <p>At times something like delirium seized him, and 
he went on blindly, stepping high above the ice. For 
hours he was tortured by the longing for raw beef, 
for the fresh blood that would put heat into his veins. 
The kitchen at Chericoke flamed upon the hillside, 
as he remembered it on winter evenings when the 
great chimney was filled with light and the crane 
was in its place above the hickory. The smell of 
newly baked bread floated in his nostrils, and for a 
little while he believed himself to be lying again 
upon the hearth as he thrilled at Aunt Rhody's 
stories. Then his fancies would take other shapes, 
and warm colours would glow in red and yellow 
circles before his eyes. When he thought of Betty 
now it was no longer tenderly but with a despairing 
passion. He was haunted less by her visible image 
than by broken dreams of her peculiar womanly 
beauties—of her soft hands and the warmth of her 
girlish bosom.</p>
                  <pb n="344"/>
                  <p>But from the first day to the last he  had no 
thought of yielding; and each feeble step had sent 
him a step farther upon the road. He had often 
fallen, but he had always struggled up again and 
laughed. Once he made a ghastly joke about his 
dying in the snow, and Jack Powell turned upon him 
with an oath and bade him to be silent.</p>
                  <p>“For God's sake don't,” added the boy weakly, 
and fell to whimpering like a child.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, go home to your mother,” retorted Dan, 
with a kind of desperate cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Jack sobbed outright.</p>
                  <p>“I wish I could,” he answered, and dropped over 
upon the roadside.</p>
                  <p>Dan caught him up, and poured his last spoonful 
of brandy down his throat, then he seized his arm 
and dragged him bodily along.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I say don't be an ass,” he implored. “Here 
comes old Stonewall.”</p>
                  <p>The commanding General rode by, glanced 
quietly over them, and passed on, his chest bowed, 
his cadet cap pulled down over his eyes. A moment 
later Dan, looking over the hillside, at the winding 
road, saw him dismount and put his shoulder to a 
sunken wheel. The sight suddenly nerved the younger 
man, and he went on quickly, dragging Jack up with 
him.</p>
                  <p>That night they rested in a burned-out clearing 
where the pine trees had been felled for fence rails. 
The rails went readily to fires, and Pinetop fried 
strips of fat bacon in the skillet he had brought upon 
his musket. Somebody produced a handful of coffee 
from his pocket, and a little later Dan,
<pb n="345"/>											
dozing beside the flames, was awakened by the 
aroma.</p>
                  <p>“By George!”  he burst out, and sat up 
speechless.</p>
                  <p>Pinetop was mixing thin cornmeal paste into the 
gravy, and he looked up as he stirred busily with a 
small stick.</p>
                  <p>“Wall, I reckon these here slapjacks air about 
done,” he remarked in a moment, adding with a 
glance at Dan, “and if your stomach's near as empty 
as your eyes, I reckon your turn comes first.”</p>
                  <p>“I reckon it does,” said Dan, and filling his tin 
cup, he drank scalding coffee in short gulps. When 
he had finished it, he piled fresh rails upon the fire 
and lay down to sleep with his feet against the 
embers.</p>
                  <p>With the earliest dawn a long shiver woke him, and 
as he put out his hand it touched something wet and 
cold. The fire had died to a red heart, and a thick 
blanket of snow covered him from head to foot. 
Straight above there was a pale yellow light where 
the stars shone dimly after the storm.</p>
                  <p>He started to his feet, rubbing a handful of snow 
upon his face. The red embers, sheltered by the body 
of a solitary pine, still glowed under the charred 
brushwood, and kneeling upon the ground, he fanned 
them into a feeble blaze. Then he laid the rails 
crosswise, protecting them with his blanket until 
they caught and flamed up against the blackened 
pine.</p>
                  <p>Near by Jack Powell was moaning in his sleep, 
and Dan leaned over to shake him into consciousness.</p>
                  <pb n="346"/>
                  <p>“Oh, damn it all, wake up, you fool!” he said 
roughly, but Jack rolled over like one drugged and 
broke into frightened whimpers such as a child 
makes in the dark. He was dreaming of home, and 
as Dan listened to the half-choked words, his face 
contracted sharply. “Wake up, you fool!” he 
repeated angrily, rolling him back and forth before 
the fire.</p>
                  <p>A little later, when Jack had grown warm beneath 
his touch, he threw a blanket over him, and turned to 
lie down in his own place. As he tossed a last armful 
on the fire, his eyes roamed over the long mounds of 
snow that filled the clearing, and he caught his 
breath as a man might who had waked suddenly 
among the dead. In the beginning of dawn, with the 
glimmer of smouldering fires reddening the snow, 
there was something almost ghastly in the sloping 
field filled with white graves and surrounded by 
white mountains. Even the wintry sky borrowed, for 
an hour, the spectral aspect of the earth, and the 
familiar shapes of cloud, as of hill, stood out with all 
the majesty of uncovered laws—stripped of the mere 
frivolous effect of light or shade. It was like the first 
day—or the last.</p>
                  <p>Dan, sitting watchful beside the fire, fell into 
the peculiar mental state which comes only after an 
inward struggle that has laid bare the sinews of one's 
life. He had fought the good fight to the end, and he 
knew that from this day he should go easier with 
himself because he knew that he had conquered.</p>
                  <p>The old doubt—the old distrust of his own
<pb n="347"/>											
strength—was fallen from him. At the moment he 
could have gone to Betty, fearless and full of hope, 
and have said, “Come, for I am grown up at last—
at last I have grown up to my love.” A great 
tenderness was in his heart, and the tears, which had 
not risen for all the bodily suffering of the past two 
weeks, came slowly to his eyes. The purpose of life 
seemed suddenly clear to him, and the large patience 
of the sky passed into his own nature as he sat 
facing the white dawn. At rare intervals in the lives 
of all strenuous souls there comes this sense of 
kinship with external things—this passionate 
recognition of the appeal of the dumb world. Sky 
and mountains and the white sweep of the fields 
awoke in him the peculiar tenderness he had always 
felt for animals or plants. His old childish petulance 
was gone from him forever; in its place he was 
aware of a kindly tolerance which softened even the 
common outlines of his daily life. It was as if he had 
awakened breathlessly to find himself a man.</p>
                  <p>And Betty came to him again—not in detached 
visions, but entire and womanly. When he 
remembered her as on that last night at Chericoke it 
was with the impulse to fall down and kiss her feet. 
Reckless and blind with anger as he had been, she 
would have come cheerfully with him whereever 
his road led; and it was this passionate betrayal of 
herself that had taught him the full measure of her 
love. An attempt to trifle, to waver, to bargain with 
the future, he might have looked back upon with 
tender scorn; but the gesture with which she had 
made her choice was as desperate as his own
<pb n="348"/>											
mood—and it was for this one reckless moment that 
he loved her best.</p>
                  <p>The east paled slowly as the day broke in a cloud, 
and the long shadows beside the fire lost their 
reddish glimmer. A little bird, dazed by the cold and 
the strange light, flew into the smoke against the 
stunted pine, and fell, a wet ball of feathers at Dan's 
feet. He picked it up, warmed it in his coat, and fed 
it from the loose crumbs in his pocket.</p>
                  <p>When Pinetop awoke he was gently stroking the bird 
while he sang in a low voice:—</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Gay and happy, gay and happy,</l>

                  <head>VII</head>
                  <head>“I WAIT MY TIME ”</head>
                  <p>WHEN he returned to Winchester it was to find 
Virginia already there as Jack Morson's wife. Since her 
marriage in late summer she had followed her husband's 
regiment from place to place, drifting at last to a big 
yellow house on the edge of the fiery little town. Dan, 
passing along the street one day, heard his name called 
in a familiar voice, and turned to find her looking at him 
through the network of a tall, wrought-iron gate.</p>
                  <p>“Virginia! Bless my soul! Where's Betty?” he 
exclaimed amazed.</p>
                  <p>Virginia left the gate and gave him her hand over the 
dried creepers on the wall.</p>
                  <p>“Why, you look ten years older,” was her response.</p>
                  <p>“Indeed! Well, two years of beggary, to say nothing of 
eight months of war, isn't just the thing to insure 
immortal youth, is it? You see, I'm turning gray.”</p>
                  <p>The pallor of the long march was in his face, giving 
him a striking though unnatural beauty. His eyes were 
heavy and his hair hung dishevelled about his brow, but 
the change went deeper still, and the girl saw it.  
“You're bigger—that's it,” she said, and added 
impulsively, “Oh, how I wish Betty could see you now.”</p>
                  <pb n="350"/>
                  <p>Her hand was upon the wall and he gave it a 
quick, pleased pressure.</p>
                  <p>“I wish to heaven she could,” he echoed heartily.</p>
                  <p>“But I shall tell her everything when I write—
everything. I shall tell her that you are taller and 
stronger and that you have been in all the fights and 
haven't a scar to show. Betty loves scars, you see, 
and she doesn't mind even wounds—real wounds. 
She wanted to go into the hospitals, but I came away 
and mamma wouldn't let her.”</p>
                  <p>“For God's sake, don't let her,” said Dan, with a 
shudder, his Southern instincts recoiling from the 
thought of service for the woman he loved. “There 
are a plenty of them in the hospitals and it's no place 
for Betty, anyway.”</p>
                  <p>“I'll tell her you think so,” returned Virginia, 
gayly. “I'll tell her that—and what else?”</p>
                  <p>He met her eyes smiling.</p>
                  <p>“Tell her I wait my time,” he answered, and began 
to talk lightly of other things. Virginia followed his 
lead with her old shy merriment. Her marriage had 
changed her but little, though she had grown a trifle 
stately, he thought, and her coquetry had dropped 
from her like a veil. As she stood there in her delicate 
lace cap and soft gray silk, the likeness to her mother 
was very marked, and looking into the future, Dan 
seemed to see her beauty ripen and expand with her 
growing womanhood. How many of her race had 
there been, he wondered, shaped after the same pure 
and formal plan.</p>
                  <p>“And it is all just the same,” he said, his eyes 
delighting in her beauty. “There is no change—
<pb n="351"/>											
don't tell me there is any change, for I'll not believe 
it. You bring it all back to me,—the lawn and the 
lilacs and the white pillars, and Miss Lydia's 
garden, with the rose leaves in the paths. Why are 
there always rose leaves in Miss Lydia's paths, 
Virginia?”</p>
                  <p>Virginia shook her head, puzzled by his whimsical 
tone.</p>
                  <p>“Because there are so many roses,” she answered 
seriously.</p>
                  <p>“No, you're wrong, there's another reason, but I 
shan't tell you.”</p>
                  <p>“My boxes are filled with rose leaves now,” said 
Virginia. “Betty gathered them for me.”</p>
                  <p>The smile leaped to his eyes. “Oh, but it makes me 
homesick,” he returned lightly. “If I tell you a 
secret, don't betray me, Virginia—I am downright 
homesick for Betty.”</p>
                  <p>Virginia patted his hand.</p>
                  <p>“So am I,” she confessed, “and so is Mammy 
Riah—she's with me now, you know—and she says 
that I might have been married without Jack, but 
never without Betty. Betty made my dress and iced 
my cake and pinned on my veil.”</p>
                  <p>“Ah, is that so?” exclaimed Dan, 
absent-mindedly. He was thinking of Betty, and he 
could almost see her hands as she pinned on the 
wedding veil—those small white hands with the 
strong fingers that had closed about his own.</p>
                  <p>“When you get your furlough you must go home, 
Dan,” Virginia was saying; “the Major is very feeble 
and—and he quarrels with almost every one.”</p>
                  <pb n="352"/>
                  <p>“My furlough,” repeated Dan, with a laugh.         
“Why, the war may end to-morrow and then we'll
all go home together and kill the fatted calf among us. 
Yes, I'd like to see the old man again before I die.”</p>
                  <p>“I pray every night that the war may end 
tomorrow,” said Virginia, “but it never does.” Then 
she turned eagerly to the Governor, who was coming 
toward them under the leafless trees along the street.</p>
                  <p>“Here's Dan, papa, do make him come in and be 
good.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor, holding himself erect in his trim 
gray uniform, insisted, with his hand upon Dan's 
shoulder, that Virginia should be obeyed; and the 
younger man, yielding easily, followed him through 
the iron gate and into the yellow house.</p>
                  <p>“I don't see you every day, my boy, sit down, 
sit down,” began the Governor, as he took his stand 
upon the hearth-rug. “Daughter, haven't you 
learned the way to the pantry yet? Dan looks as if 
he'd been on starvation rations since he joined the 
army. They aren't living high at Romney, eh?” 
and then, as Virginia went out, he fell to discussing 
the questions on all men's lips—the prospect of 
peace in the near future; hopes of intervention from 
England; the attitude of other foreign powers; 
and the reasons for the latest appointments by the 
President. When the girl came in again they let 
such topics go, and talked of home while she poured 
the coffee and helped Dan to fried chicken. She 
belonged to the order of women who delight in 
feeding a hungry man, and her eyes did not leave his
					
<pb n="353"/>											
face as she sat behind the tray and pressed the food 
upon him.</p>
                  <p>“Dan thinks the war will be over before he gets 
his furlough,” she said a little wistfully.</p>
                  <p>A shadow crossed the Governor's face.</p>
                  <p>“Then I may hope to get back in time to watch
the cradles in the wheat field,” he remarked.
“ There's little doing on the farm I'm afraid while
I'm away.”</p>
                  <p>“If they hold out six months longer—well, I'll
be surprised,” exclaimed Dan, slapping the arm of
his chair with a gesture like the Major's. “They've
found out we won't give in so long as there's a musket		
left; and that's enough for them.”</p>
                  <p>“Maybe so, maybe so,” returned the Governor,
for it was a part of his philosophy to cast his conversational		
lines in the pleasant places. “Please God, we'll drink our next 
Christmas glass at Chericoke.”</p>
                  <p>“In the panelled parlour,” added Dan, his eyes
lighting.</p>
                  <p>“With Aunt Emmeline's portrait,” finished 
Virginia, smiling. </p>
                  <p>For a time they were all silent, each looking happily 
into the far-off room, and each seeing a distinct 
and different vision. To the Governor the peaceful 
hearth grew warm again—he saw his wife and 
children gathered there, and a few friendly neighbours 
with their long-lived, genial jokes upon their 
lips. To Virginia it was her own bridal over again
 with the fear of war gone from her, and the 
quiet happiness she wanted stretching out into the 
future.  To Dan there was first his own honour
<pb n="354"/>
											
to be won, and then only Betty and himself—Betty 
and himself under next year's mistletoe together.</p>
                  <p>“Well, well,” sighed the Governor, and came back 
regretfully to the present. “It's a good place we're 
thinking of, and I reckon you're sorry enough you 
left it before you were obliged to. We all make 
mistakes, my boy, and the fortunate ones are those 
who live long enough to unmake them.”</p>
                  <p>His warm smile shone out suddenly, and 
without waiting for a reply, he began to ask for 
news of Jack Powell and his comrades, all of whom 
he knew by name. “I was talking to Colonel Burwell 
about you the other day,” he added presently, “and 
he gave you a fighting record that would do honour 
to the Major.”</p>
                  <p>“He's a nice old chap,” responded Dan, easily, for
in the first years of the Army of Northern Virginia 
the question of rank presented itself only upon the 
parade ground, and beyond the borders of the camp a 
private had been known to condescend to his own 
Colonel. “A gentleman fights for his country as he 
pleases, a plebeian as he must,” the Governor would 
have explained with a touch of his old oratory. “He's 
a nice old chap himself, but, by George, the 
discipline fits like a straight-jacket,” pursued Dan, as 
he finished his coffee. “Why, here we are three miles 
below Winchester in a few threadbare tents, and they 
make as much fuss about our coming into town as if 
we were the Yankees themselves. Talk about 
Romney! Why, it's no colder at Romney than it was 
here last week, and yet Loring's men are living in 
huts like princes.”</p>
                  <pb n="355"/>
                  <p>“Show me a volunteer and I'll show you a 
grumbler,” put in the Governor, laughing.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I'm not grumbling, I'm merely pointing out 
the facts,” protested Dan; then he rose and stood 
holding Virginia's hand as he met her upward glance 
with his unflinching admiration. “Come again! 
Why, I should say so,” he declared. “I'll come as 
long as I have a collar left, and then—well, then I'll 
pass the time of day with you over the hedge. 
Good-by, Colonel, remember I'm not a grumbler, 
I'm merely a man of facts.”</p>
                  <p>The door closed after him and a moment later 
they heard his clear whistle in the street.</p>
                  <p>“The boy is like his father,” said the Governor, 
thoughtfully, “like his father with the devil broken 
to harness. The Montjoy blood may be bad blood, 
but it makes big men, daughter.” He sighed and 
drew his small figure to its full height.</p>
                  <p>Virginia was looking into the fire. “I hope he will 
come again,” she returned softly, thinking of Betty.</p>
                  <p>But when he called again a week later Virginia did 
not see him. It was a cold starlit night, and the big 
yellow house, as he drew near it, glowed like a lamp 
amid the leafless trees. Beside the porch a number of 
cavalry horses were fastened to the pillars, and 
through the long windows there came the sound of 
laughter and of gay “good-bys.”</p>
                  <p>The “fringe of the army,” as Dan had once 
jeeringly called it, was merrily making ready for a 
raid.</p>
                  <p>As he listened he leaned nearer the window and 
watched, half enviously, the men he had once known.
<pb n="356"/>											
His old life had been a part of theirs and now, 
looking in from the outside, it seemed very far 
away—the poetry of war beside which the other 
was mere dull history in which no names were 
written. He thought of Prince Rupert, and of his own 
joy in the saddle, and the longing for the raid seized 
him like a heartache. Oh, to feel again the edge of 
the keen wind in his teeth and to hear the silver ring 
of the hoofs on the frozen road.</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">

                  </lg>
                  <p>The words floated out to him, and he laughed 
aloud as if he had awakened from a comic dream.</p>
                  <p>That was the romance of war, but, after all, he 
was only the man who bore the musket.</p>

                  <head>THE ALTAR OF THE WAR GOD</head>
                  <p>WITH the opening spring Virginia went down to 
Richmond, where Jack Morson had taken rooms for her 
in the house of an invalid widow whose three sons were 
at the front. The town was filled to overflowing with 
refugees from the North and representatives from the 
South, and as the girl drove through the crowded 
streets, she exclaimed wonderingly at the festive air the 
houses wore.</p>
                  <p>“Why, the doors are all open,” she observed. “It 
looks like one big family.”</p>
                  <p>“That's about what it is,” replied Jack. “The 
whole South is here and there's not a room to be had 
for love or money. Food is getting dear, too, they say, 
and the stranger within the gates has the best of 
everything.” He stopped short and laughed from sheer 
surprise at Virginia's loveliness.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'm glad I'm here, anyway,” said the girl, 
pressing his arm, “and Mammy Riah's glad, too, though 
she won't confess it.—Aren't you just delighted to see 
Jack again, Mammy?”</p>
                  <p>The old negress grunted in her corner of the carriage. 
“I ain' seed no use in all dis yer fittin',” she responded. 
“W'at's de use er fittin' ef dar ain' sumpen' ter fit fer dat 
you ain' got a'ready?”</p>
                  <p>“That's it, Mammy,” replied Jack, gayly, “we're
<pb n="358"/>											
fighting for freedom, and we haven't had it yet, you 
see.”</p>
                  <p>“Is dat ar freedom vittles?” scornfully retorted 
the old woman. “Is it close? is it wood ter bu'n?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it will soon be here and you'll find out,” said 
Virginia, cheerfully, and when a little later she 
settled herself in her pleasant rooms, she returned to 
her assurances.</p>
                  <p>“Aren't you glad you're here, Mammy, aren't you 
glad?” she insisted, with her arm about the old 
woman's neck.</p>
                  <p>“I'd des like ter git a good look at ole Miss agin,” 
returned Mammy Riah, softening, “caze ef you en 
ole Miss ain' des like two peas in a pod, my eyes hev 
done crack wid de sight er you. Dar ain' been nuttin' 
so pretty es you sence de day I dressed ole Miss in 
'er weddin' veil.”</p>
                  <p>“You're right,” exclaimed Jack, heartily. “But look 
at this, Virginia, here's a regular corn field at the 
back. Mrs. Minor tells me that vegetables have 
grown so scarce she has been obliged to turn her 
flower beds into garden patches.” He threw open the 
window, and they went out upon the wide piazza 
which hung above the young corn rows.</p>
                  <p>During the next few weeks, when Jack was often 
in the city, an almost feverish gayety possessed the 
girl. In the war-time parties, where the women wore 
last year's dresses, and the wit served for 
refreshment, her gentle beauty became, for a little 
while, the fashion. The smooth bands of her hair 
were copied, the curve of her eyelashes was made the 
subject of some verses which <hi rend="italics">The Examiner</hi> printed 
and the English papers quoted later on. It
<pb n="359"/>											
was a bright and stately society that filled the capital 
that year; and on pleasant Sundays when Virginia 
walked from church, in her Leghorn bonnet and white 
ruffles flaring over crinoline as they neared the ground, 
men, who had bled on fields of honour for the famous 
beauties of the South, would drop their talk to follow 
her with warming eyes. Cities might fall and battles 
might be lost and won, but their joy in a beautiful 
woman would endure until a great age.</p>
                  <p>At last Jack Morson rode away to service, and the girl 
kept to the quiet house and worked on the little 
garments which the child would need in the summer. 
She was much alone, but the delicate widow, who had 
left her couch to care for the sick and wounded soldiers, 
would sometimes come and sit near her while she 
sewed.</p>
                  <p>“This is the happiest time—before the child comes,” 
she said one day, and added, with the observant eye of 
mothers, “it will be a boy; there is a pink lining to the 
basket.”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, it will be a boy,” replied Virginia, wistfully.</p>
                  <p>“I have had six,” pursued the woman, “six sons, and 
yet I am alone now. Three are dead, and three are in the 
army. I am always listening for the summons that 
means another grave.” She clasped her thin hands and 
smiled the patient smile that chilled Virginia's blood.</p>
                  <p>“Couldn't you have kept one back?” asked the girl in a 
whisper.</p>
                  <p>The woman shook her head. Much brooding had 
darkened her mind, but there was a peculiar fervour
<pb n="360"/>											
in her face—an inward light that shone through 
her faded eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Not one—not one,” she answered. “When the 
South called, I sent the first two, and when they fell, 
I sent the others—only the youngest I kept back at 
first—he is just seventeen. Then another call came 
and he begged so hard I let him go. No, I gave them 
all gladly—I have kept none back.”</p>
                  <p>She lowered her eyes and sat smiling at her folded 
hands. Weakened in body and broken by many 
sorrows as she was, with few years before her and 
those filled with inevitable suffering, the fire of the 
South still burned in her veins, and she gave herself 
as ardently as she gave her sons. The pity of it 
touched Virginia suddenly, and in the midst of her 
own enthusiasm she felt the tears upon her lashes. 
Was not an army invincible, she asked, into which 
the women sent their dearest with a smile?</p>
                  <p>Through the warm spring weather she sat 
beside the long window that gave on the street, or 
walked slowly up and down among the vegetable rows in
the garden. The growing of the crops became an
unending interest to her and she watched them,
day by day, until she learned to know each separate
plant and to look for its unfolding. When the
drought came she carried water from the hydrant,
and assisted by Mammy Riah sprinkled the young
tomatoes until they shot up like weeds. “It is so
much better than war,” she would say to Jack
when he rode through the city. “Why will men
kill one another when they might make things live
instead?”</p>
                  <p>Beside the piazza there was a high magnolia
<pb n="361"/>											
tree, and under this she made a little rustic bench and a 
bed of flowers. When the hollyhocks and the sunflowers 
bloomed it would look like Uplands, she said, laughing.</p>
                  <p>Under the magnolia there was quiet, but from her 
front window, while she sat at work, she could see the 
whole overcrowded city passing through sun and 
shadow. Sometimes distinguished strangers would go 
by, men from the far South in black broadcloth and 
slouch hats; then the President, slim and erect and very 
grave, riding his favourite horse to one of the 
encampments near the city; and then a noted beauty 
from another state, her chin lifted above the ribbons of 
her bonnet, a smile tucked in the red corners of her lips. 
Following there would surge by the same eager, staring 
throng—men too old to fight who had lost their work; 
women whose husbands fought in the trenches for the 
money that would hardly buy a sack of flour; soldiers 
from one of the many camps; noisy little boys with tin 
whistles; silent little girls waving Confederate flags. 
Back and forth they passed on the bright May 
afternoons, filling the street with a ceaseless murmur 
and the blur of many colours.</p>
                  <p>And again the crowd would part suddenly to make 
way for a battalion marching to the front, or for a 
single soldier riding, with muffled drums, to his 
grave in Hollywood. The quick step or the slow 
gait of the riderless horse; the wild cheers or the 
silence on the pavement; the “Bonnie Blue Flag” 
or the funeral dirge before the coffin; the eager 
faces of men walking to where death was or the 
fallen ones of those who came back with the dead;
<pb n="362"/>											
the bold flags taking the wind like sails or the 
banners furled with crepe as they drooped forward—
there was not a day when these things did not go by 
near together. To Virginia, sitting at her window, it 
was as if life and death walked on within each other's 
shadow.</p>
                  <p>Then came the terrible days when the city saw 
McClellan sweeping toward it from the 
Chickahominy, when senators and clergymen 
gathered with the slaves to raise the breastworks, 
and men turned blankly to ask one another “Where 
is the army?” With the girl the question meant only 
mystification; she felt none of the white terror that 
showed in the faces round her. There was in her 
heart an unquestioning, childlike trust in the God of 
battles—sooner or later he would declare for the 
Confederacy and until then—well, there was always 
General Lee to stand between. Her chief regret was 
that the lines had closed and her mother could not 
come to her as she had promised.</p>
                  <p>In the intense heat that hung above the town she 
sat at her southern window, where the river breeze 
blew across the garden, and watched placidly the 
palm-leaf fan which Mammy Riah waved before her 
face. The magnolia tree had flowered in great white 
blossoms, and the heavy perfume mingled in 
Virginia's thoughts with the yellow sunshine, the 
fretful clamour, and the hot dust of the city. When at 
the end of May a rain storm burst overhead and sent 
the wide white petals to the earth, it was almost a 
relief to see them go. But by the morrow new ones 
had opened, and the perfume she had sickened of 
still floated from the garden.</p>
                  <pb n="363"/>
                  <p>That afternoon the sound of the guns rolled up
the Williamsburg road, and in the streets men
shouted hoarsely of an engagement with the enemy
at Seven Pines. With the noise Virginia thrilled to
her first feeling of danger, starting from a repose
which, in its unconsciousness, had been as profound
as sleep. The horror of war rushed in upon her at
the moment, and with a cry she leaned out into the
street, and listened for the next roll of the cannon.</p>
                  <p>A woman, with a scared face, looked up, saw her,
and spoke hysterically.</p>
                  <p>“There's not a man left in the city,” she cried.
“They've taken my father to defend the breastworks 
and he's near seventy. If you can sew or wash or cook, 
there'll be work enough for you, God knows, to-morrow!”</p>
                  <p>She hurried on and Virginia, turning from the
window, buried herself in the pillows upon the bed,
trying in vain to shut out the noise of the cannon
cannonading and the perfume of the magnolia 
blossoms which came in on the southern breeze. With 
night the guns grew silent and the streets empty, but still
the girl lay sleepless, watching with frightened eyes
the shadow of Mammy Riah's palm-leaf fan.</p>
                  <p>At dawn the restless murmur began again, and
Virginia, looking out in the hot sunrise, saw the
crowd hastening back to the hospitals lower down.
They were all there, all as they had been the day
before—old men limping out for news or return
returning beside the wounded; women with trembling
lips and arms filled with linen; ambulances passing
the corner at a walk, surrounded by men who had
staggered after them because there was no room
<pb n="364"/>											
left inside; and following always the same curious, 
pallid throng, fresh upon the scent of some new 
tragedy. Presently the ambulances gave out, an' yet 
the wounded came—some walking, and moan 
moaning as they walked, some borne on litters by de 
voted servants, some drawn in market wagon 
pressed into use. The great warehouses and the 
churches were thrown open to give them shelter but 
still they came and still the cry went up, “Room 
more room!”</p>
                  <p>Virginia watched it all, leaning out to follow the, 
wagons as they passed the corner. The sight 
sickened her, but something that was half a ghastly 
fascination  and half the terror of missing a face she
knew, kept her hour after hour motionless upon her 
knees. At each roll of the guns she gave a nervous 
shiver and grew still as stone.</p>
                  <p>Then, as she knelt there, a man, in clerical dress 
came down the pavement and stopped before he, 
window. “I hope your husband's wound was not 
serious, Mrs. Morson,” he said sympathetically “If 
I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to 
call on me.”</p>
                  <p>“Jack wounded!—oh, he is not wounded,” replied 
Virginia. She rose and stood wildly looking down 
upon him.</p>
                  <p>He saw his mistake and promptly retracted what 
he could.</p>
                  <p>“If you don't know of it, it can't be true,” he 
urged kindly. “So many rumours are afloat that half of 
them are without foundation. However, I will make 
inquiries if you wish,” and he passed on with a 
promise to return at once.</p>
                  <pb n="365"/>
                  <p>For a time Virginia stood blankly gazing after 
him; then she turned steadily and took down her 
bonnet from the wardrobe. She even went to the 
bureau and carefully tied the pink ribbon strings 
beneath her chin.</p>
                  <p>“I am going out, Mammy Riah,” she said when 
she had finished. “No, don't tell me I mustn't—I am 
going out, I say.”</p>
                  <p>She stamped her foot impatiently, but Mammy 
Riah made no protest.</p>
                  <p>“Des let's go den,” she returned, smoothing her 
head handkerchief as she prepared to follow.</p>
                  <p>The sun was already high above, and the breeze, 
which had blown for three days from the river, had 
dropped suddenly since dawn. Down the brick 
pavement the relentless glare flashed back into the 
sky which hung hot blue overhead. To Virginia, 
coming from the shade of her rooms, the city seemed 
a furnace and the steady murmur a great discord in 
which every note was one of pain.</p>
                  <p>Other women looking for their wounded hurried 
by her—one stopped to ask if she had been into the 
unused tobacco warehouse and if she had seen there 
a boy she knew by name? Another, with lint 
bandages in her hand, begged her to come into a 
church hard by and assist in ravelling linen for the 
surgeons. Then she looked down, saw the girl's 
figure, and grew nervous. “You are not fit, my dear, 
go home,” she urged, but Virginia shook her head 
and smiled.</p>
                  <p>“I am looking for my husband,” she answered in a 
cold voice and passed on. Mammy Riah caught up 
with her, but she broke away. “Go home if
<pb n="366"/>											
you want to—oh, go back,” she cried irritably. “I 
am looking for Jack, you know.”</p>
                  <p>Into the rude hospitals, one after one, she went 
without shuddering, passing up and down between 
the ghastly rows lying half clothed upon the bare 
plank floors. Her eyes were strained and eager, and 
more than one dying man turned to look after her as 
she went by, and carried the memory of her face 
with him to death. Once she stopped and folded a 
blanket under the head of a boy who moaned aloud, 
and then gave him water from a pitcher close at 
hand. “You're so cool—so cool,” he sobbed, 
clutching at her dress, but she smiled like one asleep 
and passed on rapidly.</p>
                  <p>When the long day had worn out at last, she came 
from an open store filled with stretchers, and started 
homeward over the burning pavement. Her search 
was useless, and the reaction from her terrible fear 
left her with a sudden tremor in her heart. As she 
walked she leaned heavily upon Mammy Riah, and 
her colour came and went in quick flashes. The heat 
had entered into her brain and with it the memory of 
open wounds and the red hands of surgeons. 
Reaching the house at last, she flung herself all 
dressed upon the bed and fell into a sleep that was 
filled with changing dreams.</p>
                  <p>At midnight she cried out in agony, believing 
herself to be still in the street. When Mammy Riah 
bent over her she did not know her, but held out 
shaking hands and asked for her mother, calling the 
name aloud in the silent house, deserted for the sake 
of the hospitals lower down. She was walking again 
on and on over the hot bricks, and the deep
<pb n="367"/>											
wounds were opening before her eyes while the 
surgeons went by with dripping hands. Once she 
started up and cried out that the terrible blue sky was 
crushing her down to the pavement which burned her 
feet. Then the odour of the magnolia filled her 
nostrils, and she talked of the scorching dust, of the 
noise that would not stop, and of the feeble breeze 
that blew toward her from the river. All night she 
wandered back and forth in the broad glare of the 
noon, and all night Mammy Riah passed from the 
clinging hands to the window where she looked for 
help in the empty street. And then, as the gray dawn 
broke, Virginia put her simple services by, and spoke 
in a clear voice.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, how lovely,” she said, as if well pleased. A 
moment more and she lay smiling like a child, her 
chin pressed deep in her open palm.</p>
                  <p>In the full sunrise a physician, who had run in at the 
old woman's cry, came from the house and stopped 
bareheaded in the breathless heat. For a moment he 
stared over the moving city and then up into the 
cloudless blue of the sky.</p>
                  <p>“God damn war!” he said suddenly, and went 
back to his knife.</p>

                  <head>THE MONTJOY BLOOD AGAIN</head>
                  <p>A MONTH later Dan heard of Virginia's death when, 
at the end of the Seven Days, he was brought wounded into 
Richmond. As he lay upon church cushions on the floor 
of an old warehouse on Main Street, with Big Abel 
shaking a tattered palm-leaf fan at his side, a 
cavalryman came up to him and held out a hand that 
trembled slightly from fatigue.</p>
                  <p>“I heard you were here. Can I do anything for you, 
Beau?” he asked.</p>
                  <p>For an instant Dan hesitated; then the other smiled, 
and he recognized Jack Morson.</p>
                  <p>“My God!  You've been ill!” he exclaimed in horror. 
Jack laughed and let his hand fall. The boyish colour 
was gone from his face, and he wore an untrimmed 
beard which made him look twice his age.</p>
                  <p>“Never better in my life,” he answered shortly.     
“Some men are made of india-rubber, Montjoy, 
and I'm one of them. I've managed to get into 
most of these blessed fights about Richmond, and 
yet I haven't so much as a pin prick to show for it. 
But what's wrong with you? Not much, I hope. 
I've just seen Bland, and he told me he thought you 
were left at Malvern Hill during that hard rain on
<pb n="369"/>											
Tuesday night. How did you get knocked over, 
anyway?”</p>
                  <p>“A rifle ball went through my leg,” replied Dan 
impatiently. “I say, Big Abel, can't you flirt that 
fan a little faster? These confounded flies stick like 
molasses.” Then he held up his left hand and looked 
at it with a grim smile. “A nasty fragment of a shell 
took off a couple of my fingers,” he added. “At first 
I thought they had begun throwing hornets' nests 
from their guns—it felt just like it. Yes, that's the 
worst with me so far; I've still got a bone to my leg, 
and I'll be on the field again before long, thank 
God.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, the worst thing about getting wounded is 
being stuffed into a hole like this,” returned Jack, 
glancing about contemptuously. “Whoever has had 
the charge of our hospital arrangements may 
congratulate himself that he has made a ghastly mess 
of them. Why, I found a man over there in the corner 
whose leg had mortified from sheer neglect, and he 
told me that the supplies for the sick had given out, 
and they'd offered him cornbread and bacon for 
breakfast.”</p>
                  <p>Dan began to toss restlessly, grumbling beneath 
his breath. “If you ever see a ball making in your 
direction,” he advised, “dodge it clean or take it 
square in the mouth; don't go in for any 
compromises with a gun, they aren't worth it.” He 
lay silent for a moment, and then spoke proudly. 
“Big Abel hauled me off the field after I went down. 
How he found me, God only knows, but find me he 
did, and under fire, too.”</p>
                  <p>“'Twuz des like pepper,” remarked Big Abel,
<pb n="370"/>											
fanning briskly, “but soon es I heah dat Marse Dan 
wuz right flat on de groun', I know dat dar warn' 
nobody ter go atter 'im 'cep'n' me. Marse Bland he 
come crawlin' out er de bresh, wuckin' 'long on his

                  <p>“‘W'at dat you got on yo' haid, Big Abel?’ he 
sez.”</p>
                  <p>“Big Abel's a hero, there's no mistake,” put in 
Dan, delighted. “Do you know he lifted me as if I 
were a baby and toted me out of that God-forsaken 
corn field in the hottest fire I ever felt—and
<pb n="371"/>											
I tipped the scales at a hundred and fifty pounds 
before I went to Romney.”</p>
                  <p>“Go way, Marse Dan, you ain' nuttin' but a rail,” 
protested Big Abel, and continued his story. “Atter I 
done tote him outer de cawn fiel' en thoo de bresh, 
den I begin ter peer roun' fer one er dese yer 
ambushes, but dere warn' nairy one un um dat warn' 
a-bulgin' a'ready. I d'clar dey des bulged twel dey

gemmen a-settin' up in hit, en one un em des es well

shake his haid en pint ter de udder like he kinder 
skeered. ‘Dis yer's my young brudder,’ he sez, 
speakin' sof'; ‘en dis yer's my young Marster,’ I 
holler back, but he shake his haid agin en drive right 
on. Lawd, Lawd, my time's 'mos' up, I 'low

A lot er yuther w'ite folks made a bee line fer dat ar

Yes, suh, I ain' never seed sech a mule es dat. She 
'uz des es full er sperit es a colt, en her name wuz 
Sally.”</p>
                  <p>“The worst of it was after getting here,” finished 
Dan, who had lain regarding Big Abel with a proud 
paternal eye, “they kept us trundling round
<pb n="372"/>											
in that cart for three mortal hours, because they 
couldn't find a hole to put us into. An uncovered 
wagon was just in front of us, filled with poor fellows 
who had been half the day in the sweltering heat, and 
we made the procession up and down the city, until at 
last some women rushed up with their servants and 
cleared out this warehouse. One was not over sixteen 
and as pretty as a picture. ‘Don't talk to me about the 
proper authorities,’ she said, stamping her foot, ‘I'll 
hang the proper authorities when they turn up—and 
in the meantime we'll go to work!’ By Jove, she was 
a trump, that girl! If she didn't save my life, she did 
still better and saved my leg.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'll try to get you moved by to-morrow,” 
said Jack reassuringly. “Every home in the city is 
filled with the wounded, they tell me, but I know a 
little woman who had two funerals from her house 
to-day, so she may be able to find room for you. 
This heat is something awful, isn't it?”</p>
                  <p>“Damnable. I hope, by the way, that Virginia is out 
of it by now.”</p>
                  <p>Jack flinched as if the words struck him between 
the eyes. For a moment he stood staring at the straw 
pallets along the wall; then he spoke in a queer voice.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, Virginia's out of it by now; Virginia's dead, 
you know.” </p>
                  <p>“Dead!” cried Dan, and raised himself upon his 
cushion. The room went black before him, and he 
steadied himself by clutching at Big Abel's arm.</p>
                  <pb n="373"/>
                  <p>At the instant the horrors of the battle-field, 
where he had seen men fall like grass before the scythe, 
became as nothing to the death of this one young 
girl. He thought of her living beauty, of the bright 
glow of her flesh, and it seemed to him that the earth 
could not hide a thing so fair.</p>
                  <p>“I left her in Richmond in the spring,” explained 
Jack, gripping himself hard. “I was off with Stuart, 
you know, and I thought her mother would get to 
her, but she couldn't pass the lines and then the fight 
came—the one at Seven Pines and—well, she died 
and the child with her.”</p>
                  <p>Dan's eyes grew very tender; a look crept into 
them which only Betty and his mother had seen 
there before.</p>
                  <p>“I would have died for her if I could, Jack, you 
know that,” he said slowly.</p>
                  <p>Jack walked off a few paces and then came back 
again. “I remember the Governor's telling me once,” 
he went on in the same hard voice, “that if a man 
only rode boldly enough at death it would always get 
out of the way. I didn't believe it at the time, but, by 
God, it's true. Why, I've gone straight into the 
enemy's lines and heard the bullets whistling in my 
ears, but I've always come out whole. When I rode 
with Stuart round McClellan's army, I was side by 
side with poor Latane when he fell in the skirmish at 
Old Church, and I sat stock still on my horse and 
waited for a fellow to club me with his sabre, but he 
wouldn't; he looked at me as if he thought I had gone 
crazy, and actually shook his head. Some men can't 
die, confound it, and I'm one of them.”</p>
                  <pb n="374"/>
                  <p>He went out, his spurs striking the stone steps as 
he passed into the street, and Dan fell back upon the 
narrow cushions to toss with fever and the memory 
of Virginia—of Virginia in the days when she wore 
her rose-pink gown and he believed he loved her.</p>
                  <p>At the door an ambulance drew up and a stretcher 
was brought into the building, and let down in one 
corner. The man on it was lying very still, and when 
he was lifted off and placed upon the blood-soaked 
top of the long pine table, he made no sound, either 
of fear or of pain. The close odours of the place 
suddenly sickened Dan and he asked Big Abel to 
draw him nearer the open window, where he might 
catch the least breeze from the river; but outside the 
July sunlight lay white and hot upon the bricks, and 
when he struggled up the reflected heat struck him 
down again. On the sidewalk he saw several 
prisoners going by amid a hooting crowd, and with 
his old instinct to fight upon the weaker side, he 
hurled an oath at the tormenters of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>“Go to the field, you crows, and be damned!” he 
called.</p>
                  <p>One of the prisoners, a ruddy-checked young 
fellow in private's clothes, looked up and touched his 
cap.</p>
                  <p>“Thank you, sir, I hope we'll meet at the front,” he 
said, in a rich Irish brogue. Then he passed on to 
Libby prison, while Dan turned from the window 
and lay watching the surgeon's faces as they probed 
for bullets.</p>
                  <p>It was a long unceiled building, filled with
<pb n="375"/>											
bright daylight and the buzzing of countless flies. 
Women, who had volunteered for the service, passed 
swiftly over the creaking boards, or knelt beside the 
pallets as they bathed the shattered limbs with steady 
fingers. Here and there a child held a glass of water 
to a man who could not raise himself, or sat fanning 
the flies from a pallid face. None was too old nor too 
young where there was work for all.</p>
                  <p>A stir passed through the group about the long 
pine table, and one of the surgeons, wiping the sweat 
from his brow, came over to where Dan lay, and 
stopped to take breath beside the window.</p>
                  <p>“By Jove, that man died game,” he said, shaking his 
handkerchief at the flies. “We took both his legs off 
at the knee, and he just gripped the table hard and 
never winked an eyelash. I told him it would kill 
him, but he said he'd be hanged if he didn't take his 
chance—and he took it and died. Talk to me about 
nerve, that fellow had the cleanest grit I ever saw.”</p>
                  <p>Dan's pulses fluttered, as they always did at an 
example of pure pluck.</p>
                  <p>“What's his regiment?” he asked, watching the 
two slaves who, followed by their mistresses, were 
bringing the body back to the stretcher.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, he was a scout, I believe, serving with Stuart 
when he was wounded. His name is—by the way, 
his name is Montjoy. Any relative of yours, I 
wonder?”</p>
                  <p>Raising himself upon his elbow, Dan turned to 
look at the dead man beside him. A heavy beard

covered the mouth and chin, but he knew the 
sunken black eyes and the hair that was like his own.</p>
                  <p>“Yes,” he answered after a long pause, “he is a 
relative of mine, I think;” and then, while the man lay 
waiting for his coffin, he propped himself upon his 
arm and followed curiously the changes made by 
death.</p>
                  <p>At his first recognition there had come only a wave 
of repulsion—the old disgust that had always dogged 
the memory of his father; then, with the dead face 
before his eyes, he was aware of an unreasoning 
pride in the blood he bore—in the fact that the 
soldier there had died pure game to the last. It was 
as a braggart and a bully that he had always thought 
of him; now he knew that at least he was not a 
craven—that he could take blows as he dealt them, 
from the shoulder out. He had hated his father, he 
told himself unflinchingly, and he did not love him 
now. Had the dead man opened his eyes he could 
have struck him back again with his mother's 
memory for a weapon. There had been war between 
them to the grave, and yet, despite himself, he knew 
that he had lost his old boyish shame of the Montjoy 
blood. With the instinct of his race to glorify 
physical courage, he had seen the shadow of his 
boyhood loom from the petty into the gigantic. Jack 
Montjoy may have been a scoundrel,—doubtless he 
was one,—but with all his misdeeds on his 
shoulders, he had lived pure game to the end.</p>
                  <p>A fresh bleeding of Dan's wound brought on a 
sudden faintness, and he fell heavily upon Big
<pb n="377"/>											
Abel's arm. With the pain a groan hovered an 
instant on his lips, but, closing his eyes, he bit it 
back and lay silent. For the first time in his life there 
had come to him, like an impulse, the knowledge 
that he must not lower his father's name.</p>

                  <head> THE RAGGED ARMY</head>
                  <p>THE brigade had halted to gather rations in a corn 
field beside the road, and Dan, lying with his head in 
the shadow of a clump of sumach, hungrily regarded 
the “roasting ears” which Pinetop had just rolled in 
the ashes. A malarial fever, which he had contracted 
in the swamps of the Chickahominy, had wasted his 
vitality until he had begun to look like the mere 
shadow of himself; gaunt, unwashed, hollow-eyed, 
yet wearing his torn gray jacket and brimless cap as 
jauntily as he had once worn his embroidered 
waistcoats. His hand trembled as he reached out for 
his share of the green corn, but weakened as he was 
by sickness and starvation, the defiant humour shone 
all the clearer in his eyes. He had still the heart for a 
whistle, Bland had said last night, looking at him a 
little wistfully.</p>
                  <p>As he lay there, with the dusty sumach shrub 
above him, he saw the ragged army pushing on into 
the turnpike that led to Maryland. Lean, sun-scorched, 
half-clothed, dropping its stragglers like
<pb n="382"/>											
leaves upon the roadside, marching in borrowed rags, 
and fighting with the weapons of its enemies, dirty, 
fevered, choking with the hot dust of the turnpike—it 
still pressed onward, bending like a blade beneath 
Lee's hand. For this army of the sick, fighting slow 
agues, old wounds, and the sharp diseases that follow 
on green food, was becoming suddenly an army of 
invasion. The road led into Maryland, and the 
brigades swept into it, jesting like schoolboys on a 
frolic.</p>
                  <p>Dan, stretched exhausted beside the road, ate his 
ear of corn, and idly watched the regiment that was 
marching by—marching, not with the even tread of 
regular troops, but with scattered ranks and broken 
column, each man limping in worn-out shoes, at his 
own pace. They were not fancy soldiers, these men, 
he felt as he looked after them. They were not 
imposing upon the road, but when their chance 
came to fight, they would be very sure to take it. 
Here and there a man still carried his old squirrel 
musket, with a rusted skillet handle stuck into the 
barrel, but when before many days the skillet would 
be withdrawn, the load might be relied upon to wing 
straight home a little later. On wet nights those 
muskets would stand upright upon their bayonets, 
with muzzles in the earth, while the rain dripped off, 
and on dry days they would carry aloft the full 
property of the mess, which had dwindled to a frying 
pan and an old quart cup; though seldom cleaned, 
they were always fit for service—or if they 
went foul what was easier than to pick up a less 
trusty one upon the field. On the other side hung 
the blankets, tied at the ends and worn like
<pb n="383"/>											
a sling from the left shoulder. The haversack was 
gone and with it the knapsack and the overcoat. 
When a man wanted a change of linen he knelt down 
and washed his single shirt in the brook, sitting in the 
sun while it dried upon the bank. If it was long in 
drying he put it on, wet as it was, and ran ahead to 
fall in with his company. Where the discipline was 
easy, each infantryman might become his own 
commissary.</p>
                  <p>Dan finished his corn, threw the husks over his 
head, and sat up, looking idly at the irregular ranks. 
He was tired and sick, and after a short rest it 
seemed all the harder to get up and take the road 
again. As he sat there he began to bandy words with 
the sergeant of a Maryland regiment that was 
passing.</p>
                  <p>“Hello! what brigade?” called the sergeant in 
friendly tones. He looked fat and well fed, and Dan 
felt this to be good ground for resentment.</p>
                  <p>“General Straggler's brigade, but it's none of 
your business,” he promptly retorted.</p>
                  <p>“General Straggler has a pretty God-forsaken 
crew,” taunted the sergeant, looking back as he 
stepped on briskly. “I've seen his regiments lining 
the road clear up from Chantilly.”</p>
                  <p>“If you'd kept your fat eyes open at Manassas 
the other day, you'd have seen them lining the 
battle-field as well,” pursued Dan pleasantly, 
chewing a long green blade of corn. “Old Stonewall 
saw them, I'll be bound. If General Straggler didn't 
win that battle I'd like to know who did.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, shucks!” responded the sergeant, and was 
out of hearing.</p>
                  <pb n="384"/>
                  <p>The regiment passed by and another took its place. 
“Was that General Lee you were yelling at down 
there, boys?” inquired Dan politely, smiling the 
smile of a man who sits by the roadside and sees 
another sweating on the march.</p>
                  <p>“Naw, that warn't Marse Robert,” replied a 
private, limping with bare feet over the border of 
dried grass. “'Twas a blamed, blank, bottomless 
well, that's what 'twas. I let my canteen down on a 
string and it never came back no mo'.”</p>
                  <p>Dan lowered his eyes, and critically regarded the 
tattered banner of the regiment, covered with the 
names of the battles over which it had hung 
unfurled. “Tennessee, aren't you?” he asked, 
following the flag.</p>
                  <p>The private shook his head, and stooped to 
remove a pebble from between his toes.</p>
                  <p>“Naw, we ain't from Tennessee,” he drawled.       
“We've had the measles—that's what's the matter 
with us.”</p>
                  <p>“You show it, by Jove,” said Dan, laughing.        
“Step quickly, if you please—this is the cleanest 
brigade in the army.”</p>
                  <p>“Huh!” exclaimed the private, eying them with 
contempt. “You look like it, don't you, sonny? Why, 
I'd ketch the mumps jest to look at sech a set o' 
rag-a-muffins!”</p>
                  <p>He went on, still grunting, while Dan rose to his 
feet and slung his blanket from his shoulder. “Look 
here, does anybody know where we're going 
anyway?” he asked of the blue sky.</p>
                  <p>“I seed General Jackson about two miles up,” 
replied a passing countryman, who had led his
<pb n="385"/>            
horse into the corn field. “Whoopee! he was going at 
a God-a'mighty pace, I tell you. If he keeps that up 
he'll be over the Potomac before sunset.”</p>
                  <p>“Then we are going into Maryland!” cried Jack 
Powell, jumping to his feet. “Hurrah for Maryland! 
We're going to Maryland, God bless her!”</p>
                  <p>The shouts passed down the road and the 
Maryland regiment in front sent back three rousing 
cheers.</p>
                  <p>“By Jove, I hope I'll find some shoes there,” said 
Dan, shaking the sand from his ragged boots, and 
twisting the shreds of his stockings about his feet.    
“I've had to punch holes in my soles and lace them 
with shoe strings to the upper leather, or they'd have 
dropped off long ago.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'll begin by making love to a seamstress 
when I'm over the Potomac,” remarked Welch, 
getting upon his feet. “I'm decidedly in need of a 
couple of patches.”</p>
                  <p>“You make love! You!” roared Jack Powell.        
“Why, you're the kind of thing they set up in 
Maryland to keep the crows away. Now if it were 
Beau. there, I see some sense in it—for, I'll be 
bound, he's slain more hearts than Yankees in this 
campaign. The women always drain out their last 
drop of buttermilk when he goes on a forage.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I don't set up to be a popinjay,” retorted 
Welch witheringly.</p>
                  <p>“Popinjay, the devil!” scowled Dan, “who's a 
popinjay?”   </p>
                  <p>“Wall, I'd like a pair of good stout breeches,” 
peacefully interposed Pinetop. “I've been backin' up 
agin the fence when I seed a lady comin' for the
<pb n="386"/>											
last three weeks, an' whenever I set down, I'm plum 
feared to git up agin. What with all the other 
things,—the Yankees, and the chills, and the 
measles,—it's downright hard on a man to have to be 
a-feared of his own breeches.”</p>
                  <p>Dan looked round with sympathy. “That's true; 
it's a shame,” he admitted smiling. “Look here, 
boys, has anybody got an extra pair of breeches?”</p>
                  <p>A howl of derision went up from the regiment as it 
fell into ranks.</p>
                  <p>“Has anybody got a few grape-leaves to spare?” 
it demanded in a high chorus.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, shut up,” responded Dan promptly. “Come 
on, Pinetop, we'll clothe ourselves to-morrow.”</p>
                  <p>The brigade formed and swung off rapidly along 
the road, where the dust lay like gauze upon the 
sunshine. At the end of a mile somebody stopped and 
cried out excitedly. “Look here, boys, the 
persimmons on that tree over thar are gittin' 'mos fit 
to eat. I can see 'em turnin',” and with the words the 
column scattered like chaff across the field. But the 
first man to reach the tree came back with a wry 
face, and fell to swearing at “the darn fool who 
could eat persimmons before frost.”</p>
                  <p>“Thar's a tree in my yard that gits ripe about 
September,” remarked Pinetop, as he returned 
dejectedly across the waste. “Ma she begins to dry 
'em 'fo' the frost sets in.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, well, we'll get a square meal in the 
morning,” responded Dan, growing cheerful as he 
dreamed of hospitable Maryland.</p>
                  <p>Some hours later, in the warm dusk, they went 
into bivouac among the trees, and, in a little
<pb n="387"/>											 
while, the campfires made a red glow upon the 
twilight.</p>
                  <p>Pinetop, with a wooden bucket on his arm, had 
plunged off in search of water, and Dan and Jack 
Powell were sent, in the interests of the mess, to 
forage through the surrounding country.</p>
                  <p>“There's a fat farmer about ten miles down, I saw 
him,” remarked a lazy smoker, by way of polite 
suggestion.</p>
                  <p>“Ten miles? Well, of all the confounded 
impudence,” retorted Jack, as he strolled off with 
Dan into the darkness.</p>
                  <p>For a time they walked in silence, depressed by 
hunger and the exhaustion of the march; then Dan 
broke into a whistle, and presently they found 
themselves walking in step with the merry air.</p>
                  <p>“Where are your thoughts, Beau?” asked Jack 
suddenly, turning to look at him by the faint 
starlight.</p>
                  <p>Dan's whistle stopped abruptly.</p>
                  <p>“On a dish of fried chicken and a pot of coffee,” 
he replied at once.</p>
                  <p>“What's become of the waffles?” demanded Jack 
indignantly. “I say, old man, do you remember the 
sinful waste on those blessed Christmas Eves at 
Chericoke? I've been trying to count the different 
kinds of meat—roast beef, roast pig, roast goose, 
roast turkey—”</p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongue, won't you?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I was just thinking that if I ever reach 
home alive I'll deliver the Major a lecture on his 
extravagance.”</p>
                  <p>“It isn't the Major; it's grandma,” groaned Dan.</p>
                  <pb n="388"/>
                  <p>“Oh, that queen among women!” exclaimed Jack 
fervently; “but the wines are the Major's, I reckon,  -
it seems to me I recall some port of which he was 
vastly proud.”</p>
                  <p>Dan delivered a blow that sent Jack on his knees 
in the stubble of an old corn field.</p>
                  <p>“If you want to make me eat you, you're going 
straight about it,” he declared.</p>
                  <p>“Look out!” cried Jack, struggling to his feet,      
“there's a light over there among the trees,” and they 
walked on briskly up a narrow country lane which 
led, after several turnings, to a large frame house 
well hidden from the road.</p>
                  <p>In the doorway a woman was standing, with a 
lamp held above her head, and when she saw them 
she gave a little breathless call.</p>
                  <p>“Is that you, Jim?”</p>
                  <p>Dan went up the steps and stood, cap in hand, 
before her. The lamplight was full upon his ragged 
clothes and upon his pallid face with its strong 
high-bred lines of mouth and chin.</p>
                  <p>“I thought you were my husband,” said the 
woman, blushing at her mistake. “If you want food 
you are welcome to the little that I have—it is very 
little.”  She led the way into the house, and 
motioned, with a pitiable gesture, to a table that was 
spread in the centre of the sitting room.</p>
                  <p>“Will you sit down?” she asked, and at the 
words, a child in the corner of the room set up a 
frightened cry.</p>
                  <p>“It's my supper—I want my supper,” wailed the 
child.</p>
                  <pb n="389"/>
                  <p>“Hush, dear,” said the woman, “they are our 
soldiers.”</p>
                  <p>“Our soldiers,” repeated the child, staring, with 
its thumb in its mouth and the tear-drops on its 
cheeks.</p>
                  <p>For an instant Dan looked at them as they stood 
there, the woman holding the child in her arms, and 
biting her thin lips from which hunger had drained 
all the red. There was scant food on the table; and as 
his gaze went back to it, it seemed to him that, for 
the first time, he grasped the full meaning of a war 
for the. people of the soil. This was the real 
thing—not the waving banners, not the bayonets, riot 
the fighting in the ranks.</p>
                  <p>His eyes were on the woman, and she smiled as all 
women did upon whom he looked in kindness.</p>
                  <p>“My dear madam, you have mistaken our 
purpose—we are not as hungry as we look,” he said, 
bowing in his ragged jacket. “We were sent merely 
to ask you if you were in need of a guard for your 
smokehouse. My Colonel hopes that you have not 
suffered at our hands.”</p>
                  <p>“There is nothing left,” replied the woman 
mystified, yet relieved. “There is nothing to guard 
except the children and myself, and we are safe, I 
think. Your Colonel is very kind—I thank him;” and 
as they went out she lighted them with her lamp 
from the front steps.</p>
                  <p>An hour later they returned to camp with aching 
limbs and empty hands.</p>
                  <p>“There's nothing above ground,” they reported, 
flinging themselves beside the fire, though the 
night was warm. “We've scoured the whole country 
and the Federals have licked it as clean as a
<pb n="390"/>											
plate before us. Bless my soul! what's that I smell?
Is this heaven, boys?”</p>
                  <p>“Licked it clean, have they?” jeered the mess.        
“Well, they left a sheep anyhow loose somewhere. 
Beau's darky hadn't gone a hundred yards before he 
found one.”</p>
                  <p>“Big Abel? You don't say so?” whistled Dan, 
in astonishment, regarding the mutton suspended on 
ramrods above the coals.</p>
                  <p>“Well, suh, 'twuz des like dis,” explained Big 
Abel, poking the roast with a small stick. “I know I 
ain' got a bit a bus'ness ter shoot dat ar sheep wid 
my ole gun, but de sheep she ain' got no better 
bus'ness strayin' roun' loose needer. She sutney wuz 
a dang'ous sheep, dat she wuz. I 'uz des a-bleeged ter 
put a bullet in her haid er she'd er hed my blood 
sho'.”</p>
                  <p>As the shout went up he divided the legs of mutton 
into shares and went off to eat his own on the dark 
edge of the wood.</p>
                  <p>A little later he came back to hang Dan's cap and 
jacket on the branches of a young pine tree. When 
he had arranged them with elaborate care, he raked 
a bed of tags together, and covered them with an 
army blanket stamped in the centre with the half 
obliterated letters U.S.</p>
                  <p>“That's a good boy, Big Abel, go to sleep,” said 
Dan, flinging himself down upon the pine-tag bed.    
“Strange how much spirit a sheep can put into a 
man. I wouldn't run now if I saw Pope's whole army 
coming.”</p>
                  <p>Turning over he lay sleepily gazing into the 
blue dusk illuminated with the campfires which were
<pb n="391"/>											
slowly dying down. Around him he heard the 
subdued murmur of the mess, deep and full, though 
rising now and then into a clearer burst of laughter. 
The men were smoking their briar-root pipes about 
the embers, leaning against the dim bodies of the 
pines, while they discussed the incidents of the 
march with a touch of the unconquerable humour of 
the Confederate soldier. Somebody had a fresh joke 
on the quartermaster, and everybody hoped great 
things of the campaign into Maryland.</p>
                  <p>“I pray it may bring me a pair of shoes,” muttered 
Dan, as he dropped off into slumber.</p>
                  <p>The next day, with bands playing “Maryland, My 
Maryland,” and the Southern Cross taking the 
September wind, the ragged army waded the 
Potomac, and passed into other fields.</p>

                  <head>A STRAGGLER FROM THE RANKS</head>
                  <p>IN two weeks it swept back, wasted, stubborn, 
hungrier than ever. On a sultry September afternoon, 
Dan, who had gone down with a sharp return of 
fever, was brought, with a wagonful of the wounded, 
and placed on a heap of straw on the brick pavement 
of Shepherdstown. For two days he had been 
delirious, and Big Abel had held him to his bed 
during the long nights when the terrible silence 
seemed filled with the noise of battle; but, as he was 
lifted from the wagon and laid upon the sidewalk, he 
opened his eyes and spoke in a natural voice.</p>
                  <p>“What's all this fuss, Big Abel? Have I been out 
of my head?”</p>
                  <p>“You sutney has, suh. You've been a-prayin' en 
shoutin' so loud dese las' tree days dat I wunner de 
Lawd ain' done shet yo' mouf des ter git rid er

                  <p>“Praying, have I?” said Dan. “Well, I declare. 
That reminds me of Mr. Blake, Big Abel. I'd like to 
know what's become of him.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel shook his head; he was in no pleasant 
humour, for the corners of his mouth were drawn 
tightly down and there was a rut between his bushy 
eyebrows.</p>
                  <pb n="393"/>
                  <p>“I nuver seed no sich place es dis yer town in all

fit wid back at home widout comin' out hyer ter git 
yo'se'f a-jumbled up wid all de po' white trash in de 
county. Dis yer wah ain' de kin' I'se use ter, caze hit 
jumbles de quality en de trash tergedder des like dey 
wuz bo'n blood kin.”</p>
                  <p>“What are you muttering about now, Big Abel?” 
broke in Dan impatiently. “For heaven's sake stop 
and find me a bed to lie on. Are they going to leave 
me out here in the street on this pile of straw?”</p>
                  <p>“De Lawd he knows,” hopelessly responded Big 
Abel. “Dey's a-fixin' places, dey sez, dat's why all 
dese folks is a-runnin' dis away en dat away like 
chickens wid dere haids chopped off. 'Fo' you hed 
yo' sense back dey wanted  ter stick you over yonder 
in dat ole blue shanty wid all de skin peelin' off hit, 
but I des put my foot right down en 'lowed dey 
'ouldn't. W'at you wan' ketch mo'n you got fur?”</p>
                  <p>“But I can't stay here,” weakly remonstrated 
Dan, “and I must have something to eat—I tell
<pb n="394"/>										
you I could eat nails. Bring me anything on God's 
earth except green corn.”</p>
                  <p>The street was filled with women, and one of 
them, passing with a bowl of gruel in her hand, came 
back and held it to his lips.</p>
                  <p>“You poor fellow!” she said impulsively, in a 
voice that was rich with sympathy. “Why, I don't 
believe you've had a bite for a month.”</p>
                  <p>Dan smiled at her from his heap of straw—an 
unkempt haggard figure.</p>
                  <p>“Not from so sweet a hand,” he responded, his 
old spirit rising strong above misfortune.</p>
                  <p>His voice held her, and she regarded him with a 
pensive face. She had known men in her day, which 
had declined long since toward its evening, and with 
the unerring instinct of her race she knew that the one 
before her was well worth the saving. Gallantry that 
could afford to jest in rags upon a pile of straw 
appealed to her Southern blood as little short of the 
heroic. She saw the pinch of hunger about the mouth, 
and she saw, too, the singular beauty which lay, 
obscured to less keen eyes, beneath the fever and the 
dirt.</p>
                  <p>“The march must have been fearful—I couldn't 
have stood it,” she said, half to test the man.</p>
                  <p>Rising to the challenge, he laughed outright.         
“Well, since you mention it, it wasn't just the thing 
for a lady,” he answered, true to his salt.</p>
                  <p>For a moment she looked at him in silence, then 
turned regretfully to Big Abel.</p>
                  <p>“The houses have filled up already, I believe,” she 
said, “but there is a nice dry stable up the street 
which has just been cleaned out for a hospital.
<pb n="395"/>										
Carry your master up the next square and then into 
the alley a few steps where you will find a 
physician. I am going now for food and bandages.”</p>
                  <p>She hurried on, and Big Abel, seizing Dan 
beneath the arms, dragged him breathlessly along the 
street.</p>
                  <p>“A stable! Huh! Hit's a wunner dey ain' ax us ter 
step right inter a nice clean pig pen,” he muttered as 
he walked on rapidly.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I don't mind the stable, but this pace will 
kill me,” groaned Dan. “Not so fast, Big Abel, not 
so fast.”</p>
                  <p>“Dis yer ain' no time to poke,” replied Big Abel, 
sternly, and lifting the young man in his arms, he 
carried him bodily into the stable and laid him on a 
clean-smelling bed of straw. The place was large and 
well lighted, and Dan, as he turned over, heaved a 
grateful sigh.</p>
                  <p>“Let me sleep—only let me sleep,” he implored 
weakly.</p>
                  <p>And for two days he slept, despite the noise about 
him. Dressed in clean clothes, brought by the lady of 
the morning, and shaved by the skilful hand of Big 
Abel, he buried himself in the fresh straw and 
dreamed of Chericoke and Betty. The coil of battle 
swept far from him; he heard none of the fret and 
rumour that filled the little street; even the moans of 
the men beneath the surgeons' knives did not 
penetrate to where he lay sunk in the stupor of 
perfect contentment. It was not until the morning of 
the third day, when the winds that blew over the 
Potomac brought the sounds of battle, that at he was 
shocked back into a troubled consciousness
<pb n="396"/>										
of his absence from the army. Then he heard the 
voices of the guns calling to him from across the 
river, and once or twice he struggled up to answer.</p>
                  <p>“I must go, Big Abel—they are in need of me,” he 
said. “Listen!  don't you hear them calling?”</p>
                  <p>“Go way f'om yer, Marse Dan, dey's des a-firin' 
at one anurr,” returned Big Abel, but Dan still tossed 
impatiently, his strained eyes searching through the 
door into the cloudy light of the alley. It was a 
sombre day, and the oppressive atmosphere seemed 
heavy with the smoke of battle.</p>
                  <p>“If I only knew how it was going,” he murmured, 
in the anguish of uncertainty. “Hush! isn't that a 
cheer, Big Abel?”</p>
                  <p>“I don' heah nuttin' but de crowin' er a rooster on 
de fence.”</p>
                  <p>“There it is again!” cried Dan, starting up. “I 
can swear it is our side. Listen—go to the door- by 
God, man, that's our yell! Ah, there comes the rattle 
of the muskets—don't you hear it?”</p>
                  <p>“Lawd, Marse Dan, I'se done hyern dat soun' twel 
I'm plum sick er it,” responded Big Abel, carefully 
measuring out a dose of arsenic, which had taken the 
place of quinine in a country where medicine was 
becoming as scarce as food. “You des swallow dis 
yer stuff right down en tu'n over en go fas' asleep 
agin.”</p>
                  <p>Taking the glass with trembling hands, Dan 
drained it eagerly.</p>
                  <p>“It's the artillery now,” he said, quivering 
with excitement. “The explosions come so fast I can 
hardly separate them. I never knew how long
<pb n="397"/>										
shells could screech before—do you mean to say 
they are really across the river? Go into the alley, 
Big Abel, and tell me if you see the smoke.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel went out and returned, after a few 
moments, with the news that the smoke could be 
plainly seen, he was told, from the upper stories. 
There was such a crowd in the street, he added, that 
he could barely get along—nobody knew anything, 
but the wounded, who were arriving in great 
numbers, reported that General Lee could hold his 
ground “against Lucifer and all his angels.”</p>
                  <p>“Hold his ground,” groaned Dan, with feverish 
enthusiasm, “why, he could hold a hencoop, for the 
matter of that, against the whole of North America! 
Oh, but this is worse than fighting. I must get up!”</p>
                  <p>“You don' wanter git out dar in dat mess er 
skeered rabbits,” returned Big Abel. “You cyarn see 
yo' han' befo'  you fur de way dey's w'igglin' roun' de 
street, en w'at's mo' you cyarn heah yo' own w'uds 
fur de racket dey's a-kickin' up. Des lis'en ter 'em 
now, des lis'en!”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I wish I could tell our guns,” murmured Dan 
at each quick explosion. “Hush! there comes the 
cheer, now—somebody's charging! It may be our 
brigade, Big Abel, and I not in it.”</p>
                  <p>He closed his eyes and fell back from sheer 
exhaustion, still following, as he lay there, the 
battalion that had sprung forward with that charging 
yell. Gray, obscured in smoke, curved in the centre, 
uneven as the Confederate line of battle always was 
-he saw it sweep onward over the September field. 
At the moment to have had his place in that
<pb n="398"/>											
charge beyond the river, he would have cheerfully 
met his death when the day was over.</p>
                  <p>Through the night he slept fitfully, awaking from 
time to time to ask eagerly if it were not almost 
daybreak; then with the dawn the silence that had 
fallen over the Potomac seemed to leave a greater 
blank to be filled with the noises along the Virginia 
shore. The hurrying footsteps in the street outside kept 
up ceaselessly until the dark again; mingled with the 
cries of the wounded and the prayers of the frightened 
he heard always that eager, tireless passing of many 
feet. So familiar it became, so constant an 
accompaniment to his restless thoughts, that when at 
last the day wore out and the streets grew empty, he 
found himself listening for the steps of a passer-by as 
intently as he had listened in the morning for the 
renewed clamour of battle on the Maryland fields.</p>
                  <p>The stir of the retreat did not reach to the stable 
where he lay; all night the army was recrossing 
the Potomac, but to Dan, tossing on his bed of 
straw, it lighted the victors' watch-fires on the 
disputed ground. He had not seen the shattered line 
of battle as it faced disease, exhaustion, and an army 
stronger by double numbers, nor had he seen the 
gray soldiers lying row on row where they had kept 
the “sunken road.” Thick as the trampled corn 
beneath them, with the dust covering them like 
powder, and the scattered fence rails lying across 
their faces, the dead men of his own brigade were 
stretched upon the hillside. The river shut these 
things from his knowledge, but through the long 
night he lay wakeful in the stable, watching with
<pb n="399"/>											
fevered eyes the tallow dips that burned dimly on 
the wall.</p>
                  <p>In the morning a nurse, coming with a bowl of 
soup, brought the news that Lee's army was again 
on Virginia soil.</p>
                  <p>“McClellan has opened a battery,” she explained, 
“that's the meaning of this fearful noise—did you 
ever hear such sounds in your life? Yes, the shells 
are flying over the town, but they've done no harm 
as yet.”</p>
                  <p>She hastened off, and a little later a dishevelled 
straggler, with a cloth about his forehead, burst in at 
the open door.</p>
                  <p>“They're shelling the town,” he cried, waving a 
dirty hand, “an' you'll be prisoners in an hour if you 
don't git up and move. The Yankees are comin', I 
seed 'em cross the river. Lee's cut up, I tell you, he's 
left half his army dead in Maryland. Thar!  they're 
shellin' the town, sho' 'nough!”</p>
                  <p>With a last wave he disappeared into the alley, and 
Dan struggled from his bed and to the door. “Give 
me your arm, Big Abel,” he said, speaking in a loud 
voice that he might be heard above the clamour. “I 
can't stay here. It isn't being killed I mind, but, by 
God, they'll never take me prisoner so long as I'm 
alive. Come here and give me your arm. You aren't 
afraid to go out, are you?”</p>
                  <p>“Lawd, Marse Dan, I'se mo' feared ter stay hyer,” 
responded Big Abel, with an ashen face. “Whar we 
gwine hide, anyhow?”</p>
                  <p>“We won't hide, we'll run,” returned Dan gravely, 
and with his arm on the negro's shoulder,
<pb n="400"/>											
he passed through the alley out into the street. There 
the noise bewildered him an instant, and his eyes 
went blind while he grasped Big Abel Abel's sleeve.</p>
                  <p>“Wait a minute, I can't see,” he said. “Now, 
that's right, go on. By George, it's bedlam turned 
loose, let's get out of it!”</p>
                  <p>“Dis away, Marse Dan, dis away, step right 
hyer,” urged Big Abel, as he slipped through the 
hurrying crowd of fugitives which packed the street. 
White and black, men and women, sick and well, 
they swarmed up and down in the dim sunshine 
beneath the flying shells, which skimmed the town to 
explode in the open fields beyond. The wounded 
were there—all who could stand upon their feet or 
walk with the aid of crutches—stumbling on in a 
mad panic to the meadows where the shells burst or 
the hot sun poured upon festering cuts. Streaming in 
noisy groups, the slaves fled after them, praying, 
shrieking, calling out that the day of judgment was 
upon them, yet bearing upon their heads whatever 
they could readily lay hands on—bundles, baskets, 
babies, and even clucking fowls tied by the legs. 
Behind them went a troop of dogs, piercing the 
tumult with excited barks.</p>
                  <p>Dan, fevered, pallid, leaning heavily upon Big Abel, 
passed unnoticed amid a throng which was, for the 
most part, worse off than himself. Men with old 
wounds breaking out afresh, or new ones staining red 
the cloths they wore, pushed wildly by him, making, 
as all made, for the country roads that led from war 
to peace. It was as if the hospitals of the world had 
disgorged themselves in the sunshine on the bright 
September fields.</p>
                  <pb n="401"/>
                  <p>Once, as Dan moved slowly on, he came upon a 
soldier, with a bandage at his throat sitting 
motionless upon a rock beside a clump of thistles, 
and moved by the expression of supreme terror on 
the man's face, he stopped and laid a hand upon his 
shoulder.</p>
                  <p>“What's the trouble, friend—given up?” he 
asked, and then drew back quickly for the man was 
dead. After this they went on more rapidly, flying 
from the horrors along the road as from the 
screaming shells and the dread of capture.</p>
                  <p>At the hour of sunset, after many halts upon the 
way, they found themselves alone and still facing the 
open road. Since midday they had stopped for dinner 
with a hospitable farmer, and, some hours later, Big 
Abel had feasted on wild grapes, which he had found 
hidden in the shelter of a little wood. In the same 
wood a stream had tinkled over silver rocks, and 
Dan, lying upon the bank of moss, had bathed his 
face and hands in the dear water. Now, while the 
shadows fell in spires across the road, they turned 
into a quiet country lane, and stood watching the sun 
as it dropped beyond the gray stone wall. In the 
grass a small insect broke into a low humming, and 
the silence, closing the next instant, struck upon 
Dan's ears like a profound and solemn melody. He 
took off his cap, and still leaning upon Big Abel, 
looked with rested eyes on the sloping meadow 
brushed with the first gold of autumn. Something 
that was not unlike shame had fallen over 
him—as if the horrors of the morning were a 
mere vulgar affront which man had put upon the 
face of nature. The very anguish of the
<pb n="402"/>											
day obtruded awkwardly upon his thoughts, and the 
wild clamour he had left behind him showed with a 
savage crudeness against a landscape in which the 
dignity of earth—of the fruitful life of seasons and 
of crops—produced in a solitary observer a quiet 
that was not untouched by awe. Where nature was 
suggestive of the long repose of ages, the brief 
passions of a single generation became as the flicker 
of a candle or the glow of a firefly in the night.</p>
                  <p>“Dat's a steep road ahead er us,” remarked Big 
Abel suddenly, as he stared into the shadows.</p>
                  <p>Dan came back with a start.</p>
                  <p>“Where shall we sleep?” he asked. “No, not in that 
field—the open sky would keep me awake, I think. 
Let's bivouac in the woods as usual.”</p>
                  <p>They moved on a little way and entered a young 
pine forest, where Big Abel gathered a handful of 
branches and kindled a light blaze.</p>
                  <p>“You ain' never eat nigger food, is you, Marse 
Dan?” he inquired as he did so.</p>
                  <p>“Good Lord!” ejaculated Dan, “ask a man who 
has lived two months on corn-field peas if he's eaten 
hog food, and he'll be pretty sure to answer ‘yes.’ Do 
you know we must have crawled about six miles to-day.” 
He lay back on the pine tags and stared straight above 
where the long green needles were illuminated on a 
background of purple space. A few fireflies made golden 
points among the treetops.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'se got a hunk er middlin',” pursued Big 
Abel thoughtfully, “a strip er fat en a strip er lean 
des like hit oughter be—but a nigger 'ooman she
<pb n="403"/>											
gun hit ter me, en I 'low Ole Marster wouldn't tech 
hit wid a ten-foot pole.” He stuck the meat upon the 
end of Dan's bayonet and held it before the flames.   
“Ole Marster wouldn't tech hit, but den he ain' never 
had dese times.”</p>
                  <p>“You're right,” replied Dan idly, filling his pipe 
and lighting it with a small red ember, “and all 
things considered, I don't think I'll raise any racket 
about that middling, Big Abel.”</p>
                  <p>“Hit ain' all nigger food, no how,” added Big Abel 
reflectively, “caze de 'ooman she done steal it f'om 
w'ite folks sho's you bo'n.”</p>
                  <p>“I only wish she had been tempted to steal some 
bread along with it,” rejoined Dan.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel's answer was to draw a hoecake wrapped 
in an old newspaper from his pocket and place it on 
a short pine stump. Then he reached for his 
jack-knife and carefully slit the hoecake down the 
centre, after which he laid the bacon in slices 
between the crusts.</p>
                  <p>“Did she steal that, too?” inquired Dan laughing.</p>
                  <p>“Naw, suh, I stole dis.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I never! You'll be ashamed to look the 
Major in the face when the war is over.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel nodded gloomily as he passed the 
sandwich to Dan, who divided it into two equal 
portions. “Dar's somebody got ter do de stealin' in 
dis yer worl',” he returned with rustic philosophy,     
“des es dar's somebody got ter be w'ite folks en 
somebody got ter be nigger, caze de same pusson 
cyarn be ner en ter dat's sho'. Dar ain' 'oom fer all de 
yerth ter strut roun' wid dey han's in dey pockets en 
dey nose tu'nt up des caze dey's hones'.
<pb n="404"/>											
Lawd, Lawd, ef I'd a-helt my han's back f'om pickin' 
en stealin' thoo dis yer wah, whar 'ould you be 
now—I ax you dat?”</p>
                  <p>Catching a dried branch the flame shot up 
suddenly, and he sat relieved against the glow, like a 
gigantic statue in black basalt.</p>
                  <p>“Well, all's fair in love and war,” replied Dan, 
adjusting himself to changed conditions. “If that 
wasn't as true as gospel, I should be dead to-morrow 
from this fat bacon.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel started up.</p>
                  <p>“Lis'en ter dat ole hoot owl,” he exclaimed 
excitedly, “he's a-settin' right over dar on dat dead 
limb a-hootin' us plum in de mouf. Ain' dat like 'em, 
now? Is you ever seed sech airs as dey put on?”</p>
                  <p>He strode off into the darkness, and Dan, seized 
with a sudden homesickness for the army, lay down 
beside his musket and fell asleep.</p>

                  <head>THE CABIN IN THE WOODS</head>
                  <p>AT daybreak they took up the march again, Dan 
walking slowly, with his musket striking the ground 
and his arm on Big Abel's shoulder. Where the lane 
curved in the hollow, they came upon a white 
cottage, with a woman milking a spotted cow in the 
barnyard. As she caught sight of them, she waved 
wildly with her linsey apron, holding the milk pail 
carefully between her feet as the spotted cow turned 
inquiringly.</p>
                  <p>“Go 'way, I don't want no stragglers here,” she 
cried, as one having authority.</p>
                  <p>Leaning upon the fence, Dan placidly regarded her.</p>
                  <p>“My dear madam, you commit an error of judgment,” 
he replied, pausing to argue.</p>
                  <p>With the cow's udder in her hand the woman 
looked up from the streaming milk.</p>
                  <p>“Well, ain't you stragglers?” she inquired.</p>
                  <p>Dan shook his head reproachfully.</p>
                  <p>“What air you, then?”</p>
                  <p>“Beggars, madam.”</p>
                  <p>“I might ha' knowed it!” returned the woman, 
with a snort. “Well, whatever you air, you kin jest 
as eas'ly keep on along that thar road. I ain't got 
nothing on this place for you. Some of you broke
<pb n="406"/>											
into my smokehouse night befo' last an' stole all the 
spar' ribs I'd been savin'. Was you the ones?”</p>
                  <p>“No, ma'am.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, you're all alike,” protested the woman, 
scornfully, “an' a bigger set o' rascals I never seed.”</p>
                  <p>“Huh!  Who's a rascal?” exclaimed Big Abel, 
angrily.</p>
                  <p>“This is the reward of doing your duty, Big 
Abel,” remarked Dan, gravely. “Never do it again. 
remember. The next time Virginia is invaded we'll sit 
by the fire and warm our feet. Good morning, 
madam.”</p>
                  <p>“Why ain't you with the army?” inquired the 
woman sharply, slapping the cow upon the side as 
she rose from her seat and took up the milk pail.      
“An officer rode by this morning an' he told me part 
of the army was campin' ten miles across on the 
other road.”</p>
                  <p>“Did he say whose division?”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I reckon you kin fight as well under one 
general as another, so long as you've got a mind to 
fight at all. You jest follow this lane about three 
miles and then keep straight along the turnpike. If 
you do that I reckon you'll git yo' deserts befo' 
sundown.” She came over to the fence and stood 
fixing them with hard, bright eyes. “My! You do 
look used up,” she admitted after a moment. “You'd 
better come in an' git a glass of this milk befo' you 
move on. Jest go roun' to the gate and I'll meet you 
at the po'ch. The dog won't bite you if you don't 
touch nothin'.”</p>
                  <p>“All right, go ahead and hide the spoons,” called
<pb n="407"/>											
Dan, as he swung open the gate and went up a little 
path bordered by prince's feathers.</p>
                  <p>The woman met them at the porch and led them 
into a clean kitchen, where Dan sat down at the table 
and Big Abel stationed himself behind his chair.</p>
                  <p>“Drink a glass of that milk the first thing,” she 
said, bustling heavily about the room, and brow-beating 
them into submissive silence, while she mixed the 
biscuits and broke the eggs into a frying-pan greased 
with bacon gravy. Plump, hearty, with a full double 
chin and cheeks like winter apples, she moved briskly 
from the wooden safe to the slow fire, which she 
stirred with determined gestures.</p>
                  <p>“It's time this war had stopped, anyhow,” she 
remarked as she slapped the eggs up into the air and 
back again into the pan. “An' if General Lee ever 
rides along this way I mean to tell him that he ought 
to have one good battle an' be done with it. Thar's no 
use piddlin' along like this twil we're all worn out and 
thar ain't a corn-field pea left in Virginny. Look here 
(to Big Abel), you set right down on that do' step an' 
I'll give you something along with yo' marster. It's a 
good thing I happened to look under the cow trough 
yestiddy or thar wouldn't have been an egg left in this 
house. That's right, turn right in an' eat hearty—don't 
mince with me.” Big Abel, cowed by her energetic 
manner, seated himself upon the door step, and for a 
half-hour the woman ceaselessly plied them with hot 
biscuits and coffee made from sweet potatoes.</p>
                  <p>“You mustn't think I mind doing for the 
soldiers,” she said when they took their leave a little
<pb n="408"/>											
later, “but I've a husban' with General Lee and I 
can't bear to see able-bodied men stragglin' about the 
country. No, don't give me nothin'—it ain't worth it. 
Lord, don't I know that you don't git enough to buy a 
bag of flour.” Then she pointed out the way again 
and they set off with a well-filled paper of luncheon.</p>
                  <p>“Beware of hasty judgments, Big Abel,” advised 
Dan, as they strolled along the road. “Now that 
woman there—she's the right sort, though she rather 
took my breath away.”</p>
                  <p>“She 'uz downright ficy at fu'st,” replied Big 
Abel, “but I d'clar dose eggs des melted in my
mouf like butter. Whew! don't I wish I had dat ole 
speckled hen f'om home. I could hev toted her unner 
my arm thoo dis wah des es well es not.”</p>
                  <p>The sun was well overhead, and across the 
landscape the heavy dew was lifted like a veil. Here 
and there the autumn foliage tinted the woods in 
splashes of red and yellow; and beyond the low stone 
wall an old sheep pasture was ablaze in goldenrod. 
From a pointed aspen beside the road a wild 
grapevine let down a fringe of purple clusters, but 
Big Abel, with a full stomach, passed them by 
indifferently. A huge buzzard, rising suddenly from 
the pasture, sailed slowly across the sky, its heavy 
shadow skimming the field beneath. As yet the 
flames of war had not blown over this quiet spot; in 
the early morning dew it lay as fresh as the world in 
its beginning.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the lane, when they came out upon the 
turnpike, they met an old farmer riding a mule home 
from the market.</p>
                  <pb n="409"/>
                  <p>“Can you tell me if McClellan has crossed the 
Potomac?” asked Dan, as he came up with him. “I 
was in the hospital at Shepherdstown, and I left it for 
fear of capture. No news has reached me, but I am 
on my way to rejoin the army.”</p>
                  <p>“Naw, suh, you might as well have stayed whar 
you were,” responded the old man, eying him with the 
suspicion which always met a soldier out of ranks.      
“McClellan didn't do no harm on this side of the 
river—he jest set up a battery on Douglas hill and 
scolded General Lee for leaving Maryland so soon. 
You needn't worry no mo' 'bout the Yankees gittin' on 
this side—thar ain't none of 'em left to come, they're 
all dead. Why, General Lee cut 'em all up into little 
pieces, that's what he did. Hooray! it was jest like 
Bible times come back agin.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as Dan moved on, the farmer raised himself 
in his stirrups and called loudly after him. “Keep to 
the Scriptures, young man, and remember Joshua, 
Smite them hip an' thigh, as the Bible says.”</p>
                  <p>All day in the bright sunshine they crept slowly 
onward, halting at brief intervals to rest in the short 
grass by the roadside, and stopping to ask information 
of the countrymen or stragglers whom they met. At last in 
the red glow of the sunset they entered a strip of thin 
woodland, and found an old negro gathering resinous knots 
from the bodies of fallen pines.</p>
                  <p>“Bless de Lawd!” he exclaimed as he faced 
them. “Is you done come fer de sick sodger at my 
cabin?”</p>
                  <pb n="410"/>
                  <p>“A sick soldier? Why, we are all sick soldiers,” 
answered Dan. “Where did he come from?”  The 
old man shook his head, as he placed his heavy split 
basket on the ground at his feet.</p>
                  <p>“I dunno, marster, he ain' come, he des drapped. 
'Twuz yestiddy en I 'uz out hyer pickin' up dis yer 
lightwood des like I is doin' dis minute, w'en I heah    
‘a-bookerty!  bookerty! bookerty!’ out dar in de road 
'en a w'ite hoss tu'n right inter de woods wid a sick 
sodger a-hangin' ter de saddle. Yes, suh, de hoss he 
come right in des like he knowed me, en w'en I helt 
out my han' he poke his nose spang inter it en 
w'innied like he moughty glad ter see me—en he 
wuz, too, dat's sho'. Well, I ketch holt er his bridle 
en lead 'im thoo de woods up ter my do' whar he tu'n 
right in en begin ter nibble in de patch er kebbage. 
All dis time I 'uz 'lowin' dat de so sodger wuz stone 
dead, but w'en I took 'im down he opened his eyes en 
axed fur water. Den I gun 'im a drink outer de goa'd 
en laid 'im flat on my bed, en in a little w'ile a nigger 
come by dat sez he b'longed ter 'im, but befo' day de 
nigger gone agin en de hoss he gone, too.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, we'll see about him, uncle, go ahead,” 
said Dan, and as the old negro went up the path among 
the trees, he followed closely on his footsteps. When 
they had gone a little way the woods opened 
suddenly and they came upon a small log cabin, with 
a yellow dog lying before the door. The dog barked 
shrilly as they approached, and a voice from the dim 
room beyond called out:—</p>
                  <p>“Hosea! Are you back so soon, Hosea?”</p>
                  <p>At the words Dan stopped as if struck by lightning,
<pb n="411"/>											
midway of the vegetable garden; then breaking from 
Big Abel, he ran forward and into the little cabin.</p>
                  <p>“Is the hurt bad, Governor?” he asked in a 
trembling voice.</p>
                  <p>The Governor smiled and held out a steady hand 
above the ragged patchwork quilt. His neat gray coat 
lay over him and as Dan caught the glitter and the 
collar he remembered the promotion after Seven 
Pines.</p>
                  <p>“Let me help you, General,” he implored. “What 
is it that we can do?”</p>
                  <p>“I have come to the end, my boy,” replied the 
Governor, his rich voice unshaken. “I have seen men 
struck like this before and I have lived twelve hours 
longer than the strongest of them. When I could go 
no farther I sent Hosea ahead to make things 
ready—and now I am keeping alive to hear from 
home. Give me water.”</p>
                  <p>Dan held the glass to his lips, and looking up, the 
Governor thanked him with his old warm glance that 
was so like Betty's.“ There are some things that are 
worth fighting for,” said the older man as he fell 
back, “and the sight of home is one of them. It was a 
hard ride, but every stab of pain carried me nearer to 
Uplands—and there are poor fellows who endure 
worse things and yet die in a strange land among 
strangers.” He was silent a moment and then spoke 
slowly, smiling a little sadly.</p>
                  <p>“My memory has failed me,” he said, “and when 
I lay here last night and tried to recall the look of the 
lawn at home, I couldn't remember—I couldn't 
remember. Are there elms or maples at the front, 
Dan?”</p>
                  <pb n="412"/>
                  <p>“Maples, sir,” replied Dan, with the deference of 
a boy. “The long walk bordered by lilacs goes up 
from the road to the portico with the Doric columns 
—you remember that?”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, yes, go on.”</p>
                  <p>“The maples have grown thick upon the lawn and 
close beside the house there is the mimosa tree that 
your father set out on his twenty-first birthday.”</p>
                  <p>“The branches touch the library window. I had 
them trimmed last year that the shutters might swing 
back. What time is it, Dan?”</p>
                  <p>Dan turned to the door.</p>
                  <p>“What time is it, Big Abel?” he called to the negro 
outside.</p>
                  <p>“Hit's goin' on eight o'clock, suh,” replied Big 
Abel, staring at the west. “De little star he shoots up 
moughty near eight, en dar he is a-comin'.”</p>
                  <p>“Hosea is there by now,” said the Governor, 
turning his head on a pillow of pine needles. “He 
started this morning, and I told him to change horses 
upon the road and eat in the saddle. Yes, he is there 
by now and Julia is on the way. Am I growing 
weaker, do you think? There is a little brandy on the 
chair, give me a few drops—we must make it last all 
night.”</p>
                  <p>After taking the brandy he steps a little, and 
awaking quietly, looked at Dan with dazed eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Who is it?” he asked, stretching out his hand.    
“Why, I thought Dick Wythe was dead.”</p>
                  <p>Dan bent over him, smoothing the hair from his 
brow with hands that were gentle as a woman's.</p>
                  <p>“Surely you haven't forgotten me,” he said.</p>
                  <pb n="413"/>
                  <p>“No—no, I remember, but it is dark, too dark. 
Why doesn't Shadrach bring the candles? And we 
might as well have a blaze in the fireplace to-night. 
It has grown chilly; there'll be a white frost before 
morning.”</p>
                  <p>There was a basket of resinous pine beside the 
hearth, and Dan kindled a fire from a handful of rich 
knots. As the flames shot up, the rough little cabin 
grew more cheerful, and the Governor laughed softly 
lying on his pallet.</p>
                  <p>“Why, I thought you were Dick Wythe, my 
boy,” he said. “The light was so dim I couldn't 
see, and, after all, it was no great harm, for there 
was not a handsomer man in the state than my 
friend Dick—the ladies used to call him ‘Apollo 
Unarmed,’ you know. Ah, I was jealous enough of 
Dick in my day, though he never knew it. He rather 
took Julia's fancy when I first began courting her, 
and, for a time, he pretended to reform and refused 
to touch a drop even at the table. I've seen him sit 
for hours, too, in Julia's Bible class of little 
negroes, with his eyes positively glued on her 
face while she read the hymns aloud. Yes, he was 
over head and ears in love with her, there's no doubt 
of that—though she has always denied it—and, I dare 
say, he would have been a much better man if she 
had married him, and I a much worse one. Somehow, I 
can't help feeling that it wasn't quite just, and that 
I ought to square up things with Dick at Judgment Day. 
I shouldn't like to reap any good from his mistakes, 
poor fellow.” He broke off for an instant, lay gazing 
at the lightwood blaze, and then took up the thread. 
“He had his fall at last, and it's been
<pb n="414"/>											
on my conscience ever since that I didn't toss that 
bowl of apple toddy through the window when I saw 
him going towards it. We were at Chericoke on 
Christmas Eve in a big snowstorm, and Dick 
couldn't resist his glass—he never could so long as 
there was a drop at the bottom of it—the more he 
drank, the thirstier he got, he used to say. Well, he 
took a good deal, more than he could stand, and 
when the Major began toasting the ladies and called 
them the prettiest things God ever made, Dick flew 
into a rage and tried to fight him. ‘There are two 
prettier sights than any woman that ever wore 
petticoats,’ he thundered; ‘and (here he ripped out an 
oath) I'll prove it to you at the sword's point before 
sunrise. God made but one thing, sir, prettier than 
the cobwebs on a bottle of wine, and that's the bottle 
of wine without the cobwebs!’ Then he went at the 
Major, and we had to hold him back and rub snow 
on his temples. That night I drove home with Julia, 
and she accepted me before we passed the wild 
cherry tree on the way to Uplands.”</p>
                  <p>As he fell silent the old negro, treading softly, 
came into the room and made the preparations for his 
simple supper, which he carried outside beneath the 
trees. In a little bared place amid charred wood, a 
fire was started, and Dan watched through the open 
doorway the stooping figures of the two negroes as 
they bent beside the flames. In a little while Big Abel 
came into the room and beckoned him, but he shook 
his head impatiently and turned away, sickened by 
the thought of food.</p>
                  <p>“Go, my boy,” said the Governor, as if he had 
seen it through closed eyes. “I never saw a private
<pb n="415"/>											
yet that wasn't hungry—one told me last week that 
his diet for a year had varied only three times -
blackberries, chinquapins, and persimmons had kept 
him alive, he said.”</p>
                  <p>Then his mind wandered again, and he talked in a 
low voice of the wheat fields at Uplands and of the 
cradles swinging all day in the sunshine. Dan, 
moving to the door, stared, with aching eyes, at the 
rich twilight which crept like purple mist among the 
trees. The very quiet of the scene grated as a discord 
upon his mood, and he would have welcomed with a 
feeling of relief any violent manifestation of the 
savagery of nature. A storm, an earthquake, even the 
thunder of battle he felt would be less tragic than 
just this pleasant evening with the serene moon 
rising above the hills.</p>
                  <p>Turning back into the room, he drew a 
split-bottomed chair beside the hearth, and began his 
patient watch until the daybreak. Under the 
patchwork quilt the Governor lay motionless, dead 
from the waist down, only the desire in his eyes 
struggling to keep the spirit to the clay. Big Abel and 
the old negro made themselves a bed beneath the 
trees, and as they raked the dried leaves together the 
mournful rustling filled the little cabin. Then they lay 
down, the yellow dog beside them, and gradually the 
silence of the night closed in.</p>
                  <p>After midnight, Dan, who had dozed in his chair 
from weariness, was awakened by the excited tones 
of the Governor's voice. The desire was vanquished 
at last and the dying man had gone back in delirium 
to the battle he had fought beyond the river. On the 
hearth the resinous pine still blazed and from
<pb n="416"/>											
somewhere among the stones came the short chirp of 
a cricket.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it's nothing—a mere scratch. Lay me 
beneath that tree, and tell Barnes to support D. H. 
Hill at the sunken road. Richardson is charging us 
across the ploughed ground and we are fighting from 
behind the stacked fence rails. Ah, they advance 
well, those Federals—not a man out of line, and their 
fire has cut the corn down as with a sickle. If 
Richardson keeps this up, he will sweep us from the 
wood and beyond the slope. No, don't take me to the 
hospital. Please God, I'll die upon the field and hear 
the cannon at the end. Look! they are charging again, 
but we still hold our ground. What, Longstreet giving 
way? They are forcing him from the ridge—the 
enemy hold it now! Ah, well, there is A. P. Hill to 
give the counter stroke. If he falls upon their flank, 
the day is—”</p>
                  <p>His voice ceased, and Dan, crossing the room, gave 
him brandy from the glass upon the chair. The 
silence had grown suddenly oppressive, and as the 
young man went back to his seat, he saw a little 
mouse gliding like a shadow across the floor. 
Startled by his footsteps, it hesitated an instant in the 
centre of the room, and then darted along the wall 
and disappeared between the loose logs in the corner. 
Often during the night it crept out from its hiding 
place, and at last Dan grew to look for it with a 
certain wistful comfort in its shy companionship.</p>
                  <p>Gradually the stars went out above the dim woods, 
and the dawn whitened along the eastern sky. With 
the first light Dan went to the open door and drew
<pb n="417"/>                                                                             
a deep breath of the refreshing air. A new day was 
coming, but he met it with dulled eyes and a crippled 
will. The tragedy of life seemed to overhang the 
pleasant prospect upon which he looked, and, as he 
stood there, he saw in his vision of the future only an 
endless warfare and a wasted land. With a start he 
turned, for the Governor was speaking in a voice that 
filled the cabin and rang out into the woods.</p>
                  <p>“Skirmishers, forward! Second the battalion of 
direction! Battalions, forward!”</p>
                  <p>He had risen upon his pallet and was pointing 
straight at the open door, but when, with a single 
stride, Dan reached him, he was already dead.</p>
               </div>
               <pb n="418"/>
               <div org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                  <head>IV</head>
                  <head> IN THE SILENCE OF THE GUNS</head>
                  <p>AT noon the next day, Dan, sitting beside the fireless 
hearth, with his head resting on his clasped hands, saw 
a shadow fall suddenly upon the floor, and, looking 
up, found Mrs. Ambler standing in the doorway.</p>
                  <p>“I am too late?” she said quietly, and he bowed 
his head and motioned to the pallet in the corner.</p>
                  <p>Without seeing the arm he put out, she crossed the 
room like one bewildered by a sudden blow, and went 
to where the Governor was lying beneath the 
patchwork quilt. No sound came to her lips; she only 
stretched out her hand with a protecting gesture and 
drew the dead man to her arms. Then it was that Dan, 
turning to leave her alone with her grief, saw that 
Betty had followed her mother and was coming 
toward him from the doorway. For an instant their 
eyes met; then the girl went to her dead, and Dan 
passed out into the sunlight with a new bitterness at 
his heart.</p>
                  <p>A dozen yards from the cabin there was a 
golden beech spreading in wide branches against the 
sky, and seating himself on a fallen log beneath it, 
he looked over the soft hills that rose round and 
deep-bosomed from the dim blue valley. He was still 
there an hour later when, hearing a rustle in the 
	
<pb n="419"/>											
grass, he turned and saw Betty coming to him over 
the yellowed leaves. His first glance showed him 
that she had grown older and very pale; his second 
that her kind brown eyes were full of tears.</p>
                  <p>“Betty, is it this way?” he asked, and opened his 
arms.</p>
                  <p>With a cry that was half a sob she ran toward him, 
her black skirt sweeping the leaves about her feet. 
Then, as she reached him, she swayed forward as if 
a strong wind blew over her, and as he caught her 
from the ground, he kissed her lips. Her tears broke 
out afresh, but as they stood there in each other's 
arms, neither found words to speak nor voice to 
utter them. The silence between them had gone 
deeper than speech, for it had in it all the dumb 
longing of the last two years—the unshaken trust, 
the bitterness of the long separation, the griefs that 
had come to them apart, and the sorrow that had 
brought them at last together. He held her so closely 
that he felt the flutter of her breast with each rising 
sob, and an anguish that was but a vibration from 
her own swept over him like a wave from head to 
foot. Since he had put her from him on that last night 
at Chericoke their passion had deepened by each 
throb of pain and broadened by each step that had 
led them closer to the common world. Not one 
generous thought, not one temptation overcome but 
had gone to the making of their love to-day—for 
what united them now was not the mere prompting 
of young impulse, but the strength out of many 
struggles and the fulness out of experiences that had 
ripened the heart of each.</p>
                  <pb n="420"/>
                  <p>“Let me look at you,” said Betty, lifting her wet 
face. “It has been so long, and I have wanted you so 
much—I have hungered sleeping and waking.”</p>
                  <p>“Don't look at me, Betty, I am a skeleton—a 
crippled skeleton, and I will not be looked at by my 
love.”</p>
                  <p>“Your love can see you with shut eyes. Oh, my best 
and dearest, do you think you could keep me from 
seeing you however hard you tried? Why, there's a 
lamp in my heart that lets me look at you even in 
the night.”</p>
                  <p>“Your lamp flatters, I am afraid to face it. Has it 
shown you this?” </p>
                  <p>He drew back and held up his maimed hand, his 
eyes fastened upon her face, where the old fervour 
had returned.</p>
                  <p>With a sob that thrilled through him, she caught his 
hand to her lips and then held it to her bosom, 
crooning over it little broken sounds of love and pity. 
Through the spreading beech above a clear gold light 
filtered down upon her, and a single yellow leaf was 
caught in her loosened hair. He saw her face, 
impassioned, glorified, amid a flood of sunshine.</p>
                  <p>“And I did not know,” she said breathlessly.         
“You were wounded and there was no one to tell me. 
Whenever there has been a battle I have sat very still 
and shut my eyes, and tried to make myself go 
straight to you. I have seen the smoke and heard the 
shots, and yet when it came I did not know it. I may 
even have laughed and talked and eaten a stupid 
dinner while you were suffering.</p>
                  <pb n="421"/>
                  <p>Now I shall never smile again until I have you safe.”</p>
                  <p>“But if I were dying I should want to see you 
smiling. Nobody ever smiled before you, Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“If you are wounded, you will send for me. 
Promise me; I beg you on my knees. You will send 
for me; say it or I shall be always wretched. Do you 
want to kill me, Dan? Promise.”</p>
                  <p>“I shall send for you. There, will that do? It 
would be almost worth dying to have you come to 
me. Would you kiss me then, I wonder?”</p>
                  <p>“Then and now,” she answered passionately. “Oh, 
I sometimes think that wars are fought to torture 
women! Hold me in your arms again or my heart will 
break. I have missed Virginia so—never a day 
passes that I do not see her coming through the 
rooms and hear her laugh—such a baby laugh, do 
you remember it?”</p>
                  <p>“I remember everything that was near to you, 
beloved.”</p>
                  <p>“If you could have seen her on her wedding day, 
when she came down in her pink crepe shawl and 
white bonnet that I had trimmed, and looked back, 
smiling at us for the last time. I have almost died 
with wanting her again—and now papa—papa! They 
loved life so, and yet both are dead, and life goes on 
without them.”</p>
                  <p>“My poor love, poor Betty.”</p>
                  <p>“But not so poor as if I had lost you, too,” 
she answered; “and if you are wounded even a little 
remember that you have promised, and I shall come 
to you. Prince Rupert and I will pass the lines
<pb n="422"/>											
together. Do you know that I have Prince Rupert, 
Dan?”</p>
                  <p>“Keep him, dear, don't let him get into the army.”</p>
                  <p>“He lives in the woods night and day, and when 
he comes to pasture I go after him while Uncle 
Shadrach watches the turnpike. When the soldiers 
come by, blue or gray, we hide him behind the 
willows in the brook. They may take the chickens -
and they do—but I should kill the man who touched 
Prince Rupert's bridle.”</p>
                  <p>“You should have been a soldier, Betty.”</p>
                  <p>She shook her head. “Oh, I couldn't shoot any one 
in cold blood—as you do—that's different. I'd have 
to hate him as much—as much as I love you.”</p>
                  <p>“How much is that?”</p>
                  <p>“A whole world full and brimming over; is that 
enough?”</p>
                  <p>“Only a little world?” he answered. “Is that all?”</p>
                  <p>“If I told you truly, you would not believe me,” 
she said earnestly. “You would shake your head and 
say: ‘Poor silly Betty, has she gone moon mad?’”</p>
                  <p>Catching her in his arms again, he kissed her hair 
and mouth and hands and the ruffle at her throat.     
“Poor silly Betty,” he repeated, “where is your 
wisdom now?”</p>
                  <p>“You have turned it into folly, sad little wisdom 
that it was.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I prefer your folly,” he said gravely. “It 
was folly that made you love me at the first; it was
<pb n="423"/>											
pure folly that brought you out to—me that night at 
Chericoke—but the greatest folly of all is just this, 
my dear.”</p>
                  <p>“But it will keep you safe.”</p>
                  <p>“Who knows? I may get shot to-morrow. There, 
there, I only said it to feel your arms about me.”</p>
                  <p>Her hands clung to him and the tears, rising to her 
lashes, fell fast upon his coat.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, don't let me lose you,” she begged. “I have 
lost so much—don't let me lose you, too.”</p>
                  <p>“Living or dead, I am yours, that I swear.”</p>
                  <p>“But I don't want you dead. I want the feel of 
you. I want your hands, your face. I want <hi rend="italics">you</hi>.”</p>
                  <p>“Betty, Betty,” he said softly. “Listen, for there 
is no word in the world that means so much as just 
your name.”</p>
                  <p>“Except yours.”</p>
                  <p>“No interruptions, this is martial law. Dear, 
dearest, darling, are all empty sounds; but when I 
say 'Betty,' it is full of life.”</p>
                  <p>“Say it again, then.”</p>
                  <p>“Betty, do you love me?”</p>
                  <p>“Ask: ‘Betty, is the sun shining?’”</p>
                  <p>“It always shines about you.”</p>
                  <p>“Because my hair is red?”</p>
                  <p>“Red? It is pure gold. Do you remember when I 
found that out on the hearth in free Levi's cabin? 
The colour went to my head, but when I put out my 
hand to touch a curl, you drew away and fastened 
them up again. Now I have pulled them all down 
and you dare not move.”</p>
                  <p>“Shall I tell you why I drew away?”</p>
                  <pb n="424"/>
                  <p>The tears were still on her lashes, but in the 
exaltation of a great passion, life, death, the grave, 
and things beyond had dwindled like stars before the 
rising sun.</p>
                  <p>“You told me then—because I was ‘a pampered 
poodle dog.’ Well, I've outgrown that objection 
certainly. Let us hope you have a fancy for lean 
hounds.”</p>
                  <p>She put up her hands in protest.</p>
                  <p>“I drew away partly because I knew you did not 
love me,” she said, meeting his eyes with her clear 
and ardent gaze, “but more because—I knew that I 
loved you.”</p>
                  <p>“You loved me then? Oh, Betty, if I had only 
known!”</p>
                  <p>“If you had known!” She covered her face. “Oh, 
it was terrible enough as it was. I wanted to beat 
myself for shame.”</p>
                  <p>“Shame? In loving me, my darling?”</p>
                  <p>“In loving you like that.”</p>
                  <p>“Nonsense. If you had only said to me: ‘My good 
sir, I love you a little bit,’I should have come to my 
senses on the spot. Even pampered poodle dogs are 
not all fat, Betty, and, as it was, I did come to the 
years of discretion that very night. I didn't sleep a 
wink.”</p>
                  <p>“Nor I.”</p>
                  <p>“I walked the floor till daybreak.”</p>
                  <p>“And I sat by the window.”</p>
                  <p>“I hurled every hard name at myself that I could 
think of. ‘Dolt and idiot’ seemed to stick. By 
George, I can't get over it. To think that I might 
have galloped down that turnpike and swept you
<pb n="425"/>											
off your feet. You wouldn't have withstood me, 
Betty, you couldn't.”</p>
                  <p>“Yet I did,” she said, smiling sadly.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I didn't have a fair chance, you see.”</p>
                  <p>“Perhaps not,” she answered, “though sometimes 
I was afraid you would hear my heart beating and 
know it all. Do you remember that morning in the 
garden with the roses?—I wouldn't kiss you 
good-by, but if you had done it against my will I'd 
have broken down. After you had gone I kissed the 
grass where you had stood.”</p>
                  <p>“My God! I can't leave you, Betty.”</p>
                  <p>She met his passionate gaze with steady eyes.</p>
                  <p>“If you were not to go I should never have told 
you,” she answered; “but if you die in battle you 
must remember it at the last.”</p>
                  <p>“It seems an awful waste of opportunities,” he 
said, “but I'll make it up on the day that I come 
back a Major-general. Then I shall say ‘forward, 
madam,’ and you'll marry me on the spot.”</p>
                  <p>“Don't be too sure. I may grow coy again when 
the war is over.”</p>
                  <p>“When you do I'll find the remedy—for I'll be a 
Major-general, then, and you a private. This war 
must make me, dear. I shan't stay in the ranks much 
longer.”</p>
                  <p>“I like you there—it is so brave,” she said.</p>
                  <p>“But you'll like me anywhere, and I prefer the 
top—the very top. Oh, my love, we'll wring our 
happiness from the world before we die!”</p>
                  <p>With a shiver she came back to the earth.</p>
                  <p>“I had almost forgotten him,” she said in keen 
self-reproach, and went quickly over the rustling
<pb n="426"/>											
leaves to the cabin door. As Dan followed her the 
day seemed to grow suddenly darker to his eyes.</p>
                  <p>On the threshold he met Mrs. Ambler, composed 
and tearless, wearing her grief as a veil that hid her 
from the outside world. Before her calm gray eyes 
he fell back with an emotion not unmixed with awe.</p>
                  <p>“I did the best I could,” he said bluntly, “but it was 
nothing.”</p>
                  <p>She thanked him quietly, asking a few questions in 
her grave and gentle voice. Was he conscious to the 
end? Did he talk of home? Had he expressed any 
wishes of which she was not aware?</p>
                  <p>“They are bringing him to the wagon now,” she 
finished steadily. “No, do not go in—you are very 
weak and your strength must be saved to hold your 
musket. Shadrach and Big Abel will carry him, I 
prefer it to be so. We left the wagon at the end of the 
path; it is a long ride home, but we have arranged to 
change horses, and we shall reach Uplands, I hope, 
by sunrise.”</p>
                  <p>“I wish to God I could go with you!” he 
exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>“Your place is with the army,” she answered. “I 
have no son to send, so you must go in his stead. He 
would have it this way if he could choose.”</p>
                  <p>For a moment she was silent, and he looked at her 
placid face and the smooth folds of her black silk 
with a wonder that checked his words.</p>
                  <p>“Some one said of him once,” she added 
presently, “that he was a man who always took his 
duty as if it were a pleasure; and it was true—so 
true. I alone saw how hard this was for him,
<pb n="427"/>											
for he hated war as heartily as he dreaded death. Yet 
when both came he met them squarely and without 
looking back.”</p>
                  <p>“He died as he had lived, the truest gentleman I 
have ever known,” he said.</p>
                  <p>A pleased smile hovered for an instant on her lips.</p>
                  <p>“He fought hard against secession until it came,” 
she pursued quietly, “for he loved the Union, and he 
had given it the best years of his life—his strong 
years, he used to say. I think if he ever felt any 
bitterness toward any one, it was for the man or men 
who brought us into this; and at last he used to leave 
the room because he could not speak of them without 
anger. He threw all his strength against the tide, yet, 
when it rushed on in spite of him, he knew where his 
duty guided him, and he followed it, as always, like 
a pleasure. You thought him sanguine, I suppose, 
but he never was so—in his heart, though the rest of 
us think differently, he always felt that he was 
fighting for a hopeless cause, and he loved it the 
more for very pity of its weakness. ‘It is the spirit 
and not the bayonet that makes history,’ he used to 
say.”</p>
                  <p>Heavy steps crossed the cabin floor, and 
Uncle Shadrach and Big Abel came out bringing 
the dead man between them. With her hand on 
the gray coat, Mrs. Ambler walked steadily as 
she leaned on Betty's shoulder. Once or twice 
she noticed rocks in the way, and cautioned the 
negroes to go carefully down the descending grade. 
The bright leaves drifted upon them, and through 
the thin woods, along the falling path, over the lacework
<pb n="428"/>											
of lights and shadows, they went slowly out into the road 
where Hosea was waiting with the open wagon.</p>
                  <p>The Governor was laid upon the straw that filled the 
bottom, Mrs. Ambler sat down beside him, and as Betty 
followed, Uncle Shadrach climbed upon the seat above 
the wheel.</p>
                  <p>“Good-by, my boy,” said Mrs. Ambler, giving him her 
hand.</p>
                  <p>“Good-by, my soldier,” said Betty, taking both of his. 
Then Hosea cracked the whip and the wagon rolled out 
into the road, scattering the gray dust high into the 
sunlight.</p>
                  <p>Dan, standing alone against the pines, looked after it 
with a gnawing hunger at his heart, seeing first Betty's 
eyes, next the gleam of her hair, then the dim figures 
fading into the straw, and at last the wagon caught up in 
a cloud of dust. Down the curving road, round a green 
knoll, across a little stream, and into the blue valley it 
passed as a speck upon the landscape. Then the distance 
closed over it, the sand settled in the road, and the blank 
purple hills crowded against the sky.</p>
               </div>
               <pb n="429"/>

                  <head>V</head>
                  <head>“THE PLACE THEREOF”</head>
                  <p>IN the full beams of the sun the wagon turned into the 
drive between the lilacs and drew up before the Doric 
columns. Mr. Bill and the two old ladies came out 
upon the portico, and the Governor was lifted down 
by Uncle Shadrach and Hosea and laid upon the high 
tester bed in the room behind the parlour.</p>
                  <p>As Betty entered the hall, the familiar sights of 
every day struck her eyes with the smart of a physical 
blow. The excitement of the shock had passed from 
her; there was no longer need to tighten the nervous 
strain, and henceforth she must face her grief where 
the struggle is always hardest—in the place where 
each trivial object is attended by pleasant memories. 
While there was something for her hands to do—or 
the danger of delay in the long watch upon the road—it 
had not been so hard to brace her strength against 
necessity, but here—what was there left that she must 
bring herself to endure? The torturing round of daily things, 
the quiet house in which to cherish new regrets, and outside 
the autumn sunshine on the long white turnpike. The old waiting 
grown sadder, was begun again; she must put out her hands to 
take up life where it had stopped, go up and down the shining
<pb n="430"/>											
staircase and through the unchanged rooms, while 
her ears were always straining for the sound of the 
cannon, or the beat of a horse's hoofs upon the road.</p>
                  <p>The brick wall around the little graveyard was 
torn down in one corner, and, while the afternoon 
sun slanted between the aspens, the Governor was 
laid away in the open grave beneath rank periwinkle. 
There was no minister to read the service, but as the 
clods of earth fell on the coffin, Mrs. Ambler opened 
her prayer book and Betty, kneeling upon the 
ground, heard the low words with her eyes on the 
distant mountains. Overhead the aspens stirred 
beneath a passing breeze, and a few withered leaves 
drifted slowly down. Aunt Lydia wept softly, and the 
servants broke into a subdued wailing, but Mrs. 
Ambler's gentle voice did not falter.</p>
                  <p>“He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he 
fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in 
one stay.”</p>
                  <p>She read on quietly in the midst of the weeping 
slaves, who had closed about her. Then, at the last 
words, her hands dropped to her sides, and she drew 
back while Uncle Shadrach shovelled in the clay.</p>
                  <p>“It is but a span,” she repeated, looking out into 
the sunshine, with a light that was almost unearthly 
upon her face.</p>
                  <p>“Come away, mamma,” said Betty, holding out 
her arms; and when the last spray of life-everlasting 
was placed upon the finished mound, they went out 
by the hollow in the wall, turning from time to
<pb n="431"/>											
time to look back at the gray aspens. Down the little 
hill, through the orchard, and across the meadows 
filled with waving golden-rod, the procession of 
white and black filed slowly homeward. When the 
lawn was reached each went to his accustomed task, 
and Aunt Lydia to her garden.</p>
                  <p>An hour later the Major rode over in response to a 
message which had just reached him.</p>
                  <p>“I was in town all the morning,” he explained in a 
trembling voice,“and I didn't get the news until a 
half hour ago. The saddest day of my life, madam, is 
the one upon which I learn that I have outlived him.”</p>
                  <p>“He loved you, Major,” said Mrs. Ambler, 
meeting his swimming eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Loved me!” repeated the old man, quivering in 
his chair, “I tell you, madam, I would rather have 
been Peyton Ambler's friend than President of the 
Confederacy! Do you remember the time he gave me 
his last keg of brandy and went without for a     
month?”</p>
                  <p>She nodded, smiling, and the Major, with red eyes 
and shaking hands, wandered into endless reminiscences 
of the long friendship. To Betty these trivial anecdotes 
were only a fresh torture, but Mrs. Ambler followed them 
eagerly, comparing her recollections with the Major's, 
and repeating in a low voice to herself characteristic 
stories which she had not heard before.</p>
                  <p>“I remember that—we had been married six months 
then,” she would say, with the unearthly light upon 
her face. “It is almost like living again to hear you, 
Major.”</p>
                  <pb n="432"/>
                  <p>“Well, madam, life is a sad affair, but it is the 
best we've got,” responded the old gentleman, 
gravely.</p>
                  <p>“He loved it,” returned Mrs. Ambler, and as the 
Major rose to go, she followed him into the hall and 
inquired if Mrs. Lightfoot had been successful with 
her weaving. “She told me that she intended to have 
her old looms set up again,” she added, “and I think 
that I shall follow her example. Between us we might 
clothe a regiment of soldiers.”</p>
                  <p>“She has had the servants brushing off the 
cobwebs for a week,” replied the Major, “and to-day 
I actually found Car'line at a spinning wheel on the 
back flagstones. There's not the faintest doubt in my 
mind that if Molly had been placed in the 
Commissary department our soldiers would be living 
to-day on the fat of the land. She has knitted thirty 
pairs of socks since spring. Good-by, my dear lady, 
good-by, and may God sustain you in your double 
affliction.”</p>
                  <p>He crossed the portico, bowed as he descended the 
steps, and, mounting in the drive, rode slowly away 
upon his dappled mare. When he reached the 
turnpike he lifted his hat again and passed on at an 
amble.</p>
                  <p>During the next few months it seemed to Betty 
that she aged a year each day. The lines closed and 
opened round them; troops of blue and gray 
cavalrymen swept up and down the turnpike; the 
pastures were invaded by each army in its turn, and 
the hen-house became the spoil of a regiment of 
stragglers. Uncle Shadrach had buried the silver
<pb n="433"/>											
beneath the floor of his cabin, and Aunt Floretta set 
her dough to rise each morning under a loose pile of 
kindling wood. Once a deserter penetrated into 
Betty's chamber, and the girl drove him out at the 
point of an old army pistol, which she kept upon her 
bureau.</p>
                  <p>“If you think I am afraid of you come a step nearer,” 
she had said coolly, and the man had turned to run 
into the arms of a Federal officer, who was sweeping 
up the stragglers. He was a blue-eyed young 
Northerner, and for three days after that he had set a 
guard upon the portico at Uplands. The memory of 
the small white-faced: girl, with her big army pistol 
and the blazing eyes haunted him from that hour until 
Appomattox, when he heaved a sigh of relief and 
dismissed it from his thoughts. “She would have shot 
the rascal in another second,” he said afterward,         
“and, by George, I wish she had.”</p>
                  <p>The Governor's wine cellar was emptied long ago, 
the rare old wine flowing from broken casks across 
the hall.</p>
                  <p>“What does it matter?” Mrs. Ambler had asked 
wearily, watching the red stream drip upon the 
portico. “What is wine when our soldiers are 
starving for bread? And besides, war lives off the 
soil, as your father used to say.”</p>
                  <p>Betty lifted her skirts and stepped over the bright 
puddles, glancing disdainfully after the Hessian 
stragglers, who went singing down the drive.</p>
                  <p>“I hope their officers will get them,” she 
remarked vindictively, “and the next time they offer
us a guard, I shall accept him for good and all, if
<pb n="434"/>                                                                                 
he happens to have been born on American soil. I 
don't mind Yankees so much—you can usually quiet 
them with the molasses jug—but these foreigners are 
awful. From a Hessian or a renegade Virginian, 
good Lord deliver us.”</p>
                  <p>“Some of them have kind hearts,” remarked Mrs. 
Ambler, wonderingly. “I don't see how they can bear 
to come down to fight us. The Major met General 
McClellan, you know, and he admitted afterwards 
that he shouldn't have known from his manner that 
he was not a Southern gentleman.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I hope he has left us a shoulder of bacon 
in the smokehouse,” replied Betty, laughing. “You 
haven't eaten a mouthful for two days, mamma.”</p>
                  <p>“I don't feel that I have a right to eat, my dear,” 
said Mrs. Ambler. “It seems a useless extravagance 
when every little bit helps the army.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I can't support the army, but I mean to 
feed you,” returned Betty decisively, and she went 
out to ask Hosea if he had found a new hiding place 
for the cattle. Except upon the rare mornings when 
Mr. Bill left his fishing, the direction of the farm had 
fallen entirely upon Betty's shoulders. Wilson, the 
overseer, was in the army, and Hosea had gradually 
risen to take his place. “We must keep things up,” 
the girl had insisted, “don't let us go to rack and 
ruin—papa would have hated it so,” and, with the 
negro's aid, she had struggled to keep up the 
common tenor of the old country life.</p>
                  <p>Rising at daybreak, she went each morning to 
overlook the milking of the cows, hidden in their
<pb n="435"/>											
retreat among the hills; and as the sun rose higher, 
she came back to start the field hands to the 
ploughing and the women to the looms in one of the 
detached wings. Then there was the big storehouse to 
go into, the rations of the servants to be drawn from 
their secret corners, the meal to be measured, and the 
bacon to be sliced with the care which fretted her 
lavish hands. After this there came the shucking of 
the corn, a negro frolic even in war years, so long as 
there was any corn to shuck, and lastly the counting 
of the full bags of grain before the heavy wagon was 
sent to the little mill beside the river. From sunrise to 
sunset the girl's hands were not idle for an instant, 
and in the long evenings, by the light of the 
home-made tallow dips, which served for candles, 
she would draw out a gray yarn stocking and knit 
busily for the army, while she tried, with an aching 
heart, to cheer her mother. Her sunny humour had 
made play of a man's work as of a woman's anxiety.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, on bright mornings, Mr. Bill would 
stroll over with his rod upon his shoulder and a 
string of silver perch in his hand. He had grown old 
and very feeble, and his angling had become a 
passion mightier than an army with bayonets. He 
took small interest in the war—at times he seemed 
almost unconscious of the suffering around 
him—but he enjoyed his chats with Union officers 
upon the road, who occasionally capped his stories 
of big sport with tales of mountain trout which they 
had drawn from Northern streams. He would sit for 
hours motionless under the willows by the river, and 
once when his house was fired, during a
<pb n="436"/>											
raid up the valley, he was heard to remark regretfully 
that the messenger had “scared away his first bite in 
an hour.”  Placid, wide-girthed, dull-faced, innocent as 
a child, he sat in the midst of war dangling his line 
above the silver perch.</p>

                  <head>THE PEACEFUL SIDE OF WAR</head>
                  <p>ON a sparkling January morning, when Lee's army 
had gone into winter quarters beside the 
Rappahannock, Dan stood in the doorway of his log 
hut smoking the pipe of peace, while he watched a 
messmate putting up a chimney of notched sticks 
across the little roadway through the pines.</p>
                  <p>“You'd better get Pinetop to daub your chinks for 
you,” he suggested. “He can make a mixture of wet 
clay and sandstone that you couldn't tell from 
mortar.”</p>
                  <p>“You jest wait till I git through these shoes 
an' I'll show you,” remarked Pinetop, from the woodpile, 
where he was making moccasins of untanned beef 
hide laced with strips of willow. “I ain't goin' to set 
my bar' feet on this frozen groun' agin, if I can help 
it. 'Tain't so bad in summer, but, I d'clar it takes all 
the spirit out of a fight when you have to run 
bar-footed over the icy stubble.”</p>
                  <p>“Jack Powell lost his shoes in the battle of 
Fredericksburg,” said Baker, as he carefully fitted his 
notched sticks together.  “That's why he got 
promoted, I reckon. He stepped into a mud puddle, 
and his feet came out but his shoes didn't.”</p>
                  <pb n="438"/>
                  <p>“Well, I dare say, it was cheaper for the 
Government to give him a title than a pair of shoes,” 
observed Dan, cynically. “Why, you are going in for 
luxury! Is that pile of oak shingles for your roof? 
We made ours of rails covered with pine tags.”</p>
                  <p>“And the first storm that comes along sweeps 
them off—yes, I know. By the way, can anybody tell 
me if there's a farmer with a haystack in these   
parts?”</p>
                  <p>“Pinetop got a load about three miles up,” replied 
Dan, emptying his pipe against the door sill. “I say, 
who is that cavalry peacock over yonder? By 
George, it's Champe!”</p>
                  <p>“Perhaps it's General Stuart,” suggested Baker 
witheringly, as Champe came composedly between 
the rows of huts, pursued by the frantic jeers of the 
assembled infantry.</p>
                  <p>“Take them earrings off yo' heels—take 'em off! 
Take 'em off!” yelled the chorus, as his spurs rang 
on the stones. “My gal she wants 'em—take 'em 
off!”</p>
                  <p>“Take those tatters off your backs—take 'em 
off!” responded Champe, genial and undismayed, swinging 
easily along in his worn gray uniform, his black 
plume curling over his soft felt hat.</p>
                  <p>As Dan watched him, standing in the doorway, he 
felt, with a sudden melancholy, that a mental gulf 
had yawned between them. The last grim months 
which had aged him with experiences as with years, 
had left Champe apparently unchanged. All the 
deeper knowledge, which he had bought with his 
youth for the price, had passed over his
<pb n="439"/>											
cousin like the clouds, leaving him merely gay and 
kind as he had been of old.</p>
                  <p>“Hello, Beau!” called Champe, stretching out 
his hand as he drew near. “I just heard you were over 
here, so I thought I'd take a look. How goes the    
war?”</p>
                  <p>Dan refilled his pipe and borrowed a light from 
Pinetop.</p>
                  <p>“To tell the truth,” he replied, “I have come to 
the conclusion that the fun and frolic of war consist 
in picket duty and guarding mule teams.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, these excessive dissipations have taken up 
so much of your time that I've hardly laid eyes on 
you since you got routed by malaria. Any news from 
home?”</p>
                  <p>“Grandma sent me a Christmas box, which she 
smuggled through, heaven knows how. We had a 
jolly dinner that day, and Pinetop and I put on our 
first clean clothes for three months. Big Abel got a 
linsey suit made at Chericoke—I hope he'll come 
along in it.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Beau, Beau!” lamented Champe. “How 
have the mighty fallen? You aren't so particular now 
about wearing only white or black ties, I reckon.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, shoestrings are usually black, I believe,” 
returned Dan, with a laugh, raising his hand to his 
throat.</p>
                  <p>Champe seated himself upon the end of an oak 
log, and taking off his hat, ran his hand through his 
curling hair. “I was at home last summer on a 
furlough,” he remarked, “and I declare, I hardly 
knew the valley. If we ever come out of this war
<pb n="440"/>											
it will take an army with ploughshares to bring the 
soil up again. As for the woods—well, well, we'll 
never have them back in our day.”</p>
                  <p>“Did you see Uplands?” asked Dan eagerly.</p>
                  <p>“For a moment. It was hardly safe, you know, so 
I was at home only a day. Grandpa told me that the 
place had lain under a shadow ever since Virginia's 
death. She was buried in Hollywood—it was 
impossible to bring her through the lines they 
said—and Betty and Mrs. Ambler have taken this 
very hardly.”</p>
                  <p>“And the Governor,” said Dan, with a tremor in 
his voice as he thought of Betty.</p>
                  <p>“And Jack Morson,” added Champe, “he fell at 
Brandy Station when I was with him. At first he was 
wounded only slightly, and we tried to get him to the 
rear, but he laughed and went straight in again. It 
was a sabre cut that finished him at the last.”</p>
                  <p>“He was a first-rate chap,” commented Dan, “but 
I never knew exactly why Virginia fell in love with 
him.”</p>
                  <p>“The other fellow never does. To be quite candid, 
it is beyond my comprehension how a certain lady 
can prefer the infantry to the cavalry—yet she does 
emphatically.”</p>
                  <p>Dan coloured.</p>
                  <p>“Was grandpa well?” he inquired lamely.</p>
                  <p>With a laugh Champe flung one leg over the other, 
and clasped his knee.</p>
                  <p>“It's an ill wind that blows nobody good,” he 
responded. “Grandpa's thoughts are so much given 
to the Yankees that he has become actually angelic
<pb n="441"/>											
to the rest of us. By the way, do you know that Mr. 
Blake is in the army?”</p>
                  <p>“What?” cried Dan, aghast.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I don't mean that he really carries a 
rifle—though he swears he would if he only had twenty 
years off his shoulders—but he has become our 
chaplain in young Chrysty's place, and the boys 
say there is more gun powder in his prayers than 
in our biggest battery.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed Dan.</p>
                  <p>“You ought to hear him—it's better than fighting 
on your own account. Last Sunday he gave us a 
prayer in which he said: ‘O Lord, thou knowest that 
we are the greatest army thou hast ever seen; put 
forth thy hand then but a very little and we will whip 
the earth.’ By Jove, you look cosey here,” he added, 
glancing into the hut where Dan and Pinetop slept in 
bunks of straw. “I hope the roads won't dry before 
you've warmed your house.” He shook hands again, 
and swung off amid the renewed jeers that issued 
from the open doorways.</p>
                  <p>Dan watched him until he vanished among the 
distant pines, and then, turning, went into the little 
hut where he found Pinetop sitting before a rude 
chimney, which he had constructed with much 
labour. A small book was open on his knee, over 
which his yellow head drooped like a child's, and 
Dan saw his calm face reddened by the glow of the 
great log fire.</p>
                  <p>“Hello! What's that?” he inquired lightly.</p>
                  <p>The mountaineer started from his abstraction, and 
the blood swept to his forehead as he rose from
			 
<pb n="442"/>											
the half of a flour barrel upon which he had been 
sitting.</p>
                  <p>“'Tain't nothin',” he responded, and as he towered 
to his great height his fair curls brushed the ceiling 
of crossed rails. In his awkwardness the book fell to 
the floor, and before he could reach it, Dan had 
stooped, with a laugh, and picked it up.</p>
                  <p>“I say, there are no secrets in this shebang,” he 
said smiling. Then the smile went out, and his face 
grew suddenly grave, for, as the book fell open in his 
hand, he saw that it was the first primer of a child, 
and on the thumbed and tattered page the word         
“RAT” stared at him in capital letters.</p>
                  <p>“By George, man!” he exclaimed beneath his 
breath, as he turned from Pinetop to the blazing 
logs.</p>
                  <p>For the first time in his life he was brought 
face to face with the tragedy of hopeless ignorance 
for an inquiring mind, and the shock stunned him, 
at the moment, past the power of speech. Until 
knowing Pinetop he had, in the lofty isolation of 
his class, regarded the plebeian in the light of an 
alien to the soil, not as a victim to the kindly 
society in which he himself had moved—a society 
produced by that free labour which had degraded the 
white workman to the level of the serf. At the instant 
the truth pierced home to him, and he recognized it 
in all the grimness of its pathos. Beside that genial 
plantation life which he had known he saw rising the 
wistful figure of the poor man doomed to conditions 
which he could not change—born, it may be, like 
Pinetop, self-poised, yet with an untaught intellect, 
grasping, like him, after the primitive
<pb n="443"/>											 
knowledge which should be the birthright of every 
child. Even the spectre of slavery, which had 
shadowed his thoughts, as it had those of many a 
generous mind around him, faded abruptly before the 
very majesty of the problem that faced him now. In his 
sympathy for the slave, whose bondage he and his 
race had striven to make easy, he had overlooked the 
white sharer of the negro's wrong. To men like 
Pinetop, slavery, stern or mild, could be but an equal 
menace, and yet these were the men who, when 
Virginia called, came from their little cabins in the 
mountains, who tied the flint-locks upon their 
muskets and fought uncomplainingly until the end. 
Not the need to protect a decaying institution, but the 
instinct in every free man to defend the soil, had 
brought Pinetop, as it had brought Dan, into the 
army of the South.</p>
                  <p>“Look here, old man, you haven't been quite fair 
to me,” said Dan, after the long silence. “Why didn't 
you ask me to help you with this stuff?”</p>
                  <p>“Wall, I thought you'd joke,” replied Pinetop 
blushing, “and I knew yo' nigger would.”</p>
                  <p>“Joke? Good Lord!” exclaimed Dan. “Do you 
think I was born with so short a memory, you 
scamp? Where are those nights on the way to 
Romney when you covered me with your overcoat to 
keep me from freezing in the snow? Where, for that 
matter, is that march in Maryland when Big Abel 
and you carried me three miles in your arms after I 
had dropped delirious by the roadside? If you 
thought I'd joke you about this, Pinetop, all I can 
say is that you've turned into a confounded fool.”</p>
                  <pb n="444"/>
                  <p>Pinetop came back to the fire and seated himself 
upon the flour barrel in the corner. “'Twas this way, 
you see,” he said, breaking, for the first time, 
through his strong mountain reserve. “I al'ays 
thought I'd like to read a bit, 'specially on winter 
evenings at home, when the nights are long and you 
don't have to git up so powerful early in the 
mornings, but when I was leetle thar warn't nobody 
to teach me how to begin; maw she didn't know 
nothin' an' paw he was dead, though he never got 
beyond the first reader when he was 'live.”</p>
                  <p>He looked up and Dan nodded gravely over his 
pipe.</p>
                  <p>“Then when I got bigger I had to work mighty 
hard to keep things goin'—an' it seemed to me every 
time I took out that thar leetle book at night I got so 
dead sleepy I couldn't tell one letter from another; A 
looked jest like Z.”</p>
                  <p>“I see,” said Dan quietly. “Well, there's time 
enough here anyhow. It will be a good way to pass 
the evenings.” He opened the primer and laid it on 
his knee, running his fingers carelessly through its 
dog-eared pages. “Do you know your letters?” he 
inquired in a professional tone.</p>
                  <p>“Lordy, yes,” responded Pinetop. “I've got about 
as fur as this here place.” He crossed to where Dan 
sat and pointed with a long forefinger to the printed 
words, his mild blue eyes beaming with excitement.</p>
                  <p>“I reckon I kin read that by myself,” he added 
with an embarrassed laugh. “T-h-e  c-a-t  c-a-u-g-h-t  
t-h-e  r-a-t. Ain't that right?”</p>
                  <p>“Perfectly. We'll pass on to the next.” And
<pb n="445"/>											
they did so, sitting on the halves of a divided flour 
barrel before the blazing chimney.</p>
                  <p>From this time there were regular lessons in the 
little hut, Pinetop drawling over the soiled primer, or 
crouching, with his long legs twisted under him and 
his elbows awkwardly extended, while he filled a 
sheet of paper with sprawling letters.</p>
                  <p>“I'll be able to write to the old woman soon,” he 
chuckled jubilantly, “an' she'll have to walk all the 
way down the mounting to git it read.”</p>
                  <p>“You'll be a scholar yet if this keeps up,” replied 
Dan, slapping him upon the shoulder, as the 
mountaineer glanced up with a pleased and shining 
face. “Why, you mastered that first reader there in 
no time.”</p>
                  <p>“A powerful heap of larnin' has to pass through 
yo' head to git a leetle to stick thar,” commented 
Pinetop, wrinkling his brows. “Air we goin' to have 
the big book agin to-night?”</p>
                  <p>“The big book” was a garbled version of 
“Les Miserables,” which, after running the blockade 
with a daring English sailor, had passed from 
regiment to regiment in the resting army. At first 
Dan had begun to read with only Pinetop for a 
listener, but gradually, as the tale unfolded, 
a group of eager privates filled the little hut 
and even hung breathlessly about the doorway in 
the winter nights. They were mostly gaunt, unwashed 
volunteers from the hills or the low countries, to 
whom literature was only a vast silence and life a 
courageous struggle against greater odds. To Dan the 
picturesqueness of the scene lent itself with all the
<pb n="446"/>											
force of its strong lights and shadows, and with the 
glow of the pine torches on the open page, his eyes 
would sometimes wander from the words to rest 
upon the kindling faces in the shaggy circle by the 
fire. Dirty, hollow-eyed, unshaven, it sat spellbound 
by the magic of the tale it could not read.</p>
                  <p>“By Gosh! that's a blamed good bishop,” 
remarked an unkempt smoker one evening from the 
threshold, where his beef-hide shoes were covered 
with fine snow. “I don't reckon Marse Robert could 
ha' beat that.”</p>
                  <p>“Marse Robert ain't never tried,” put in a 
companion by the fire.</p>
                  <p>“Wall, I ain't sayin' he had,” corrected the first 
speaker, through a cloud of smoke. “Lord, I hope 
when my time comes I kin slip into heaven on Marse 
Robert's coat-tails.”</p>
                  <p>“If you don't, you won't never git thar!” jeered 
the second. Then they settled themselves again, and 
listened with sombre faces and twitching lips.</p>
                  <p>It was during this winter that Dan learned how 
one man's influence may fuse individual and opposing 
wills into a single supreme endeavour. The Army of 
Northern Virginia, as he saw it then, was moulded, 
sustained, and made effective less by the authority of 
the Commander than by the simple power of Lee over the 
hearts of the men who bore his muskets. For a time Dan 
had sought to trace the groundspring of this impassioned 
loyalty, seeking a reason that could not be found in 
generals less beloved. Surely it was not the illuminated 
figure of the conqueror, for when had the Commander 
held closer the affection of his troops than in that
<pb n="447"/>											
ill-starred campaign into Maryland, which left the 
moral victory of a superb fight in McClellan's 
hands? No, the charm lay deeper still, beyond all the 
fictitious aids of fortune—somewhere in that serene 
and noble presence he had met one evening as the 
gray dusk closed, riding alone on an old road 
between level fields. After this it was always as a 
high figure against a low horizon that he had seen 
the man who made his army.</p>
                  <p>As the long winter passed away, he learned, not 
only much of the spirit of his own side, but 
something that became almost a sunny tolerance, of 
the great blue army across the Rappahannock. He 
had exchanged Virginian tobacco for Northern 
coffee at the outposts, and when on picket duty 
along the cold banks of the river he would sometimes 
shout questions and replies across the stream. In 
these meetings there was only a wide curiosity with 
little bitterness; and once a friendly New England 
picket had delivered a religious homily from the 
opposite shore, as he leaned upon his rifle.</p>
                  <p>“I didn't think much of you Rebs before I came 
down here,” he had concluded in a precise and 
energetic shout, “but I guess, after all, you've got 
souls in your bodies like the rest of us.”</p>
                  <p>“I reckon we have. Any coffee over your side?”</p>
                  <p>“Plenty. The war's interfered considerably with 
the tobacco crop, ain't it?”</p>
                  <p>“Well, rather; we've enough for ourselves, but 
none to offer our visitors.”</p>
                  <p>“Look here, are all these things about you in the 
papers gospel truth?”</p>
                  <pb n="448"/>
                  <p>“Can't say. What things?”</p>
                  <p>“Do you always carry bowie knives into battle?”</p>
                  <p>“No, we use scissors—they're more convenient.”</p>
                  <p>“When you catch a runaway nigger do you chop 
him up in little pieces and throw him to the hogs?”</p>
                  <p>“Not exactly. We boil him down and grease our 
cartridges.”</p>
                  <p>“After Bull Run did you set up all the live 
Zouaves you got hold of as targets for rifle     
practice?”</p>
                  <p>“Can't remember about the Zouaves. Rather think 
we made them into flags.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you Rebels take the breath out of me,” 
commented the picket across the river; and then, as 
the relief came, Dan hurried back to look for the mail 
bag and a letter from Betty. For Betty wrote often 
these days—letters sometimes practical, sometimes 
impassioned, always filled with cheer, and often with 
bright gossip. Of her own struggle at Uplands and 
the long days crowded with work, she wrote no 
word; all her sympathy, all her large passion, and all 
her wise advice in little matters were for Dan from 
the beginning to the end. She made him promise to 
keep warm if it were possible, to read his Bible when 
he had the time, and to think of her at all hours in 
every season. In a neat little package there came one 
day a gray knitted waistcoat which he was to wear 
when on picket duty beside the river, “and be very 
sure to fasten it,” she had written. “I have sewed the 
buttons on so tight they can't come off. Oh, if I had 
only papa and Virginia and you back again I could 
be happy in a hovel. Dear mamma says so, too.”</p>
                  <pb n="449"/>
                  <p>And after much calm advice there would come 
whole pages that warmed him from head to foot.     
“Your kisses are still on my lips,” she wrote one 
day. “The Major said to me, ‘Your mouth is very 
warm, my dear,’ and I almost answered, ‘you feel 
Dan's kisses, sir.’ What would he have said, do you 
think? As it was I only smiled and turned away, and 
longed to run straight to you to be caught up in your 
arms and held there forever. O my beloved, when 
you need me only stretch out your hands and I will 
come.”</p>

                  <head>THE SILENT BATTLE</head>
                  <p>DESPITE the cheerfulness of Betty's letters, there 
were times during the next dark years when it seemed 
to her that starvation must be the only end. The negroes 
had been freed by the Governor's will, but the girl 
could not turn them from their homes, and, with the 
exception of the few field hands who had followed the 
Union army, they still lived in their little cabins and 
drew their daily rations from the storehouse. Betty 
herself shared their rations of cornmeal and bacon, 
jealously guarding her small supplies of milk and eggs 
for Mrs. Ambler and the two old ladies. “It makes no 
difference what I eat,” she would assure protesting 
Mammy Riah. “I am so strong, you see, and besides I 
really like Aunt Floretta's ashcakes.”</p>
                  <p>Spring and summer passed, with the ripened 
vegetables which Hosea had planted in the garden, and 
the long winter brought with it the old daily struggle to 
make the slim barrels of meal last until the next 
harvesting. It was in this year that the four women at 
Uplands followed the Major's lead and invested their 
united fortune in Confederate bonds.    “We will rise or 
fall with the government,” Mrs. Ambler had said with 
her gentle authority. “Since we have given it our best, 
let it take all freely.”</p>
                  <p>“Surely money is of no matter,” Betty had an
<pb n="451"/>											
answered, lavishly disregardful of worldly goods. 
“Do you think we might give our jewels, too? I have 
grandma's pearls hidden beneath the floor, you 
know.”</p>
                  <p>“If need be—let us wait, dear,” replied her 
mother, who, grave and pallid as a ghost, would eat 
nothing that, by any chance, could be made to reach 
the army.</p>
                  <p>“I do not want it, my child, there are so many 
hungrier than I,” she would say when Betty brought 
her dainty little trays from the pantry.</p>
                  <p>“But I am hungry for you, mamma—take it for 
my sake,” the girl would beg, on the point of tears.   
“You are starving, that is it—and yet it does not 
feed the army.”</p>
                  <p>In these days it seemed to her that all the anguish 
of her life had centred in the single fear of losing her 
mother. At times she almost reproached herself with 
loving Dan too much, and for months she would 
resolutely keep her thoughts from following him, 
while she laid her impassioned service at her 
mother's feet. Day or night there was hardly a 
moment when she was not beside her, trying, by very 
force of love, to hold her back from the death to 
which she went with her slow and stately tread.</p>
                  <p>For Mrs. Ambler, who had kept her strength 
for a year after the Governor's death, seemed at 
last to be gently withdrawing from a place in which 
she found herself a stranger. There was nothing to 
detain her now; she was too heartsick to adapt herself 
to many changes; loss and approaching poverty 
might be borne by one for whom the chief thing yet 
remained, but she had seen this go, and so she
<pb n="452"/>											
waited, with her pensive smile, for the moment when 
she too might follow. If Betty were not looking she 
would put her untasted food aside; but the girl soon 
found this out, and watched her every mouthful with 
imploring eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, mamma, do it to please me,” she entreated.</p>
                  <p>“Well, give it back, my dear,” Mrs. Ambler 
answered, complaisant as always, and when Betty 
triumphantly declared, “You feel better now—you 
know you do, you dearest,” she responded readily: -</p>
                  <p>“Much better, darling; give me some straw to 
plait—I have grown to like to have my hands busy. 
Your old bonnet is almost gone, so I shall plait you 
one of this and trim it with a piece of ribbon Aunt 
Lydia found yesterday in the attic.”</p>
                  <p>“I don't mind going bareheaded, if you will only 
eat.”</p>
                  <p>“I was never a hearty eater. Your father used to 
say that I ate less than a robin. It was the custom for 
ladies to have delicate appetites in my day, you see; 
and I remember your grandma's amazement when 
Miss Pokey Mickleborough was asked at our table 
what piece of chicken she preferred, and answered 
quite aloud, ‘Leg, if you please.’  She was 
considered very indelicate by your grandma, who 
had never so much as tasted any part except the 
wing.”</p>
                  <p>She sat, gentle and upright, in her rose rosewood 
chair, her worn silk dress rustling as she crossed her 
feet, her beautiful hands moving rapidly with the 
straw plaiting. “I was brought up very carefully, my 
dear,” she added, turning her head with its
<pb n="453"/>											
shining bands of hair a little silvered since the 
beginning of the war. “‘A girl is like a flower,’ your 
grandpa always said.‘If a rough wind blows near 
her, her bloom is faded.’ Things are different now  -
very different.”</p>
                  <p>“But this is war,” said Betty.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler nodded over the slender braid.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, this is war,” she added with her wistful 
smile, and a moment afterward looked up again to 
ask in a dazed way:—</p>
                  <p>“What was the last battle, dear? I can't 
remember.”</p>
                  <p>Betty's glance sought the lawn outside where the 
warm May sunshine fell in shafts of light upon the 
purple lilacs.</p>
                  <p>“They are fighting now in the Wilderness,” she 
answered, her thoughts rushing to the famished army 
closed in the death grapple with its enemy. “Dan 
got a letter to me and he says it is like fighting in a 
jungle, the vines are so thick they can't see the other 
side. He has to aim by ear instead of sight.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler's fingers moved quickly.</p>
                  <p>“He has become a very fine man,” she said.          
“Your father always liked him—and so did I—but 
at one time we were afraid that he was going to be 
too much his father's son—he looked so like him on 
his wild days, especially when he had taken wine 
and his colour went high.”</p>
                  <p>“But he has the Lightfoot eyes. The Major, 
Champe, even their Great-aunt Emmeline have those 
same gray eyes that are always laughing.”</p>
                  <p>“Jane Lightfoot had them, too,” added Mrs.
<pb n="454"/>											
Ambler. “She used to say that to love hard went 
with them. ‘The Lightfoot eyes are never 
disillusioned,’ she once told me. I wonder if she 
remembered that afterwards, poor girl.”</p>
                  <p>Betty was silent for a moment.</p>
                  <p>“It sounds cruel,” she confessed, “but you know, I 
have sometimes thought that it may have been just a 
little bit her fault, mamma.”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler smiled. “Your grandpa used to say 
‘get a woman to judge a woman and there comes a 
hanging.’ ”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I don't mean that,” responded Betty, 
blushing. “Jack Montjoy was a scoundrel, I 
suppose—but I think that even if Dan had been a 
scoundrel, instead of so big and noble—I could have 
made his life so much better just because I loved 
him; if love is only large enough it seems to me that 
all such things as being good and bad are swallowed 
up.”</p>
                  <p>“I don't know—your father was very good, and I 
loved him because of it. He was of the salt of the 
earth, as Mr. Blake wrote to me last year.”</p>
                  <p>“There has never been anybody like papa,” said 
Betty, her eyes filling. “Not even Dan—for I can't 
imagine papa being anything but what he was—and 
yet I know even if Dan were as wild as the Major 
once believed him to be, I could have gone with him 
not the least bit afraid. I was so sure of myself that 
if he had beaten me he could not have broken my 
spirit. I should always have known that some day 
he would need me and be sorry.”</p>
                  <p>Tender, pensive, bred in the ancient ways, Mrs.
Ambler looked up at her and shook her head.</p>
                  <pb n="455"/>
                  <p>“You are very strong, my child,” she answered,    
“and I think it makes us all lean too much upon 
you.”</p>
                  <p>Taking her hand, Betty kissed each slender finger. 
“I lean on you for the best in life, mamma,” she 
answered, and then turned to the window. “It's my 
working time,” she said, “and there is poor Hosea 
trying to plough without horses. I wonder how he'll 
manage it.”</p>
                  <p>“Are all the horses gone, dear?”</p>
                  <p>“All except Prince Rupert and papa's mare. Peter 
keeps them hidden in the mountains, and I carried 
them the last two apples yesterday. Prince Rupert 
knew me in the distance and whinnied before Peter 
saw me. Now I'll send Aunt Lydia to you, dearest, 
while I see about the weaving. Mammy Riah has 
almost finished my linsey dress.” She kissed her 
again and went out to where the looms were working 
in one of the detached wings.</p>
                  <p>The summer went by slowly. The famished army 
fell back inch by inch, and at Uplands the battle 
grew more desperate with the days. Without horses 
it was impossible to plant the crops and on the open 
turnpike swept by bands of raiders as by armies, it 
was no less impossible to keep the little that was 
planted. Betty, standing at her window in the early 
mornings, would glance despairingly over the 
wasted fields and the quiet little cabins, where the 
negroes were stirring about their work. Those 
little cabins, forming a crescent against the green 
hill, caused her an anxiety before which her own 
daily suffering was of less account. When the
<pb n="456"/>											
time came that was fast approaching, and the secret 
places were emptied of their last supplies, where could 
those faithful people turn in their distress? The question 
stabbed her like a sword each morning before she put on 
her bonnet of plaited straw and ran out to make her first 
round of the farm. Behind her cheerful smile there was 
always the grim fear growing sharper every hour.</p>
                  <p>Then on a golden summer afternoon, when the larder 
had been swept by a band of raiders, she became 
suddenly aware that there was nothing in the house for 
her mother's supper, and, with the army pistol in her 
hand, set out across the fields for Chericoke. As she 
walked over the sunny meadows, the shadow that was 
always lifted in Mrs. Ambler's presence fell heavily 
upon her face and she choked back a rising sob. What 
would the end be? she asked herself in sudden anguish, 
or was this the end?</p>
                  <p>Reaching Chericoke she found Mrs. Lightfoot and 
Aunt Rhody drying sliced sweet potatoes on boards 
along the garden fence, where the sunflowers and 
hollyhocks flaunted in the face of want.</p>
                  <p>“I've just gotten a new recipe for coffee, child,” the 
old lady began in mild excitement. “Last year I made it 
entirely of sweet potatoes, but Mrs. Blake tells me that 
she mixes rye and a few roasted chestnuts. Mr. Lightfoot 
took supper with her a week ago, and he actually 
congratulated her upon still keeping her real old Mocha. 
Be sure to try it.”</p>
                  <p>“Indeed I shall—the very next time Hosea gets any 
sweet potatoes. Some raiders have just dug up the last 
with their sabres and eaten them raw.”</p>
                  <pb n="457"/>
                  <p>“Well, they'll certainly have colic,” remarked Mrs. 
Lightfoot, with professional interest.</p>
                  <p>“I hope so,” said Betty, “but I've come over to 
beg something for mamma's supper—eggs, chickens, 
anything except bacon. She can't touch that, she'd starve 
first.”</p>
                  <p>Looking anxious, Mrs. Lightfoot appealed to Aunt 
Rhody, who was busily spreading little squares of sweet 
potatoes on the clean boards. “Rhody, can't you possibly 
find us some eggs?” she inquired.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Rhody stopped her work and turned upon them 
all the dignity of two hundred pounds of flesh.</p>
                  <p>“How de hens gwine lay w'en dey's done been eaten 
up?” she demanded.</p>
                  <p>“Isn't there a single chicken left?” hopelessly 
persisted the old lady.</p>
                  <p>“Who gwine lef' 'em? Ain' dose low-lifeted sodgers 
dat rid by yestiddy done stole de last one un 'um off de 
nes'?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot sternly remonstrated.</p>
                  <p>“They were our own soldiers, Rhody, and they don't 
steal—they merely take.”</p>
                  <p>“I don' see de diffunce,” sniffed Aunt Rhody. 
“All I know is dat dey pulled de black hen plum off 
de nes' whar she wuz a-settin'. Den des now de Yankees 
come a-prancin' up en de ducks tuck ter de water en de 
Yankees dey went a-wadin' atter dem. Yes, Lawd, dey 
went a-wadin' wid dey shoes on.”</p>
                  <p>The old lady sighed.</p>
                  <p>“I'm afraid there's nothing, Betty,” she said, 
“though Congo has gone to town to see if he can
<pb n="458"/>											
find any fowls, and I'll send some over if he brings 
them. We had a Sherman pudding for dinner 
ourselves, and I know the sorghum in it will give the 
Major gout for a month. Well, well, this is war, I 
reckon, and I must say, for my part, I never 
expected it to be conducted like a flirtation behind a 
fan.”</p>
                  <p>“I nuver seed no use a-fittin' unless you is gwine 
ter fit in de yuther pusson's yawd,” interpolated 
Aunt Rhody. “De way ter fit is ter keep a-sidlin' 
furder f'om yo' own hen roos' en nigher ter de hen 
roos' er de somebody dat's a-fittin' you.”</p>
                  <p>“Hold your tongue, Rhody,” retorted Mrs. 
Lightfoot, and then drew Betty a little to one side. “I 
have some port wine, my dear,” she whispered,        
“which Cupid buried under the old asparagus bed, 
and I'll tell him to dig up several bottles and take 
them to you. The other servants don't know of it, so I 
can't get it out till after dark. Poor Julia!  how does 
she stand these terrible days?”</p>
                  <p>Betty's lips quivered. “I have to force her to eat,” 
she replied, “and it seems almost cruel—she is so 
tired of life.”</p>
                  <p>“I know, my dear,” responded the old lady, 
wiping her eyes; “and we have our troubles, too. 
Champe is in prison now, and Mr. Lightfoot is very 
much upset. He says this General Grant is not like 
the others, that he knows him—and he's the kind to 
hang on as long as he's alive.”</p>
                  <p>“But we must win in the end,” said Betty, 
desperately; “we have sacrificed so much, how can 
it all be lost?”</p>
                  <p>“That's what Mr. Lightfoot says—we'll win in
<pb n="459"/>											
the end, but the end's a long way off. By the way, 
did you know that Car'line had run off after the 
Yankees? When I think how that girl had been 
spoiled!”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I wish they'd all go,” returned Betty. 
“All except Mammy and Uncle Shadrach and Hosea—
and even they make starvation that much nearer.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, we shan't starve yet awhile, dear; I'm in 
hopes that Congo will ransack the town. If you 
would only stay.”</p>
                  <p>But Betty shook her head and went back across 
the meadows, walking rapidly through the lush grass 
of the deserted pastures. Her mind was so filled with 
Mrs. Lightfoot's forebodings, that when, in climbing 
the low stone wall, she saw the free negro, Levi, 
coming toward her, she turned to him with a gesture 
that was almost an appeal for sympathy.</p>
                  <p>“Uncle Levi, these are sad times now,” she said.    
“I am looking for something for mamma's supper 
and I can find nothing.”</p>
                  <p>The old negro, shabbier, lonelier, poorer than ever, 
shambled up to the wall where she was standing and 
uncovered a split basket full of eggs.</p>
                  <p>“I'se got a pa'cel er hens hid in de woods over 
yonder,” he explained, “en I keep de eggs behin' de 
j'ists in my cabin. Sis Floretty she tole me dat de 
w'ite folks wuz wuss off den de niggers now, so I 
brung you dese.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Uncle Levi!” cried Betty, seizing his
gnarled old hands. As she looked at his stricken 
figure a compassion as acute as pain brought the 
quick tears to her eyes. She remembered the isolation of
<pb n="460"/>											
his life, the scornful suspicion he had met from white 
and black, and the injustice that had set him free and 
sold Sarindy up the river.</p>
                  <p>“You wuz moughty good ter me,” muttered free Levi, 
shuffling his bare feet in the long grass, “en Marse Dan, 
he wuz moughty good ter me, too, 'fo' he went away on 
dat black night. I 'members de time w'en dat ole 
Rainy-day Jones up de big road (we all call him 
Rainy-day caze he looked so sour) had me right by de 
collar wid de hick'ry branch a sizzlin' in de a'r, en I des 
'lowed de een had mos' come. Yes, Lawd, I did, but I 
warn' countin' on Marse Dan. He warn' mo'n wais' high 
ter ole Rainy-day, but de furs' thing I know dar wuz ole 
Rainy-day on de yerth wid Marse Dan a-lashin' `im wid 
de branch er hick'ry.”</p>
                  <p>“We shall never forget you—Dan and I,” answered 
Betty, as she took the basket, “and when the time comes 
we will repay you.”</p>
                  <p>The old negro smiled and turned from her, and Betty, 
quickening her pace, ran on to Uplands, reaching the 
house a little breathless from the long walk.</p>
                  <p>In the chamber upstairs she found Mrs. Ambler 
sitting before the window with her open Bible on the 
sill, where a spray of musk roses entered from the 
outside wall.</p>
                  <p>“All well, mamma?” she asked in a cheerful voice.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ambler started and turned slowly from the 
window.</p>
                  <p>“I see a great light on the road,” she murmured 
wonderingly.</p>
                  <pb n="461"/>
                  <p>Crossing to where she sat, Betty leaned out above 
the climbing roses and glanced to the mountains 
huddled against the sky.</p>
                  <p>“It is General Sheridan going up the valley,” she 
said.</p>

                  <head>THE LAST STAND</head>
                  <p>IN the face of a damp April wind a remnant of 
Lee's army pushed forward along an old road skirted by 
thin pine woods. As the column moved on slowly, it 
threw out skirmishers on either flank, where the 
Federal cavalry hovered in the distance. Once in an 
open clearing it formed into a hollow square and 
marched in battle line to avoid capture. While the 
regiments kept in motion the men walked steadily in 
the ranks, with their hollowed eyes staring straight 
ahead from their gaunt, tanned faces; but at the first 
halt they fell like logs upon the roadside, sleeping 
amid the sound of shots and the stinging cavalry. 
With the cry of “Forward!” they struggled to their 
feet again, and went stumbling on into the vast 
uncertainty and the approaching night. Breathless, 
starving, with their rags pinned together, and their 
mouths bleeding from three days' rations of parched 
corn, they still kept onward, marching with 
determined eyes to whatever and wherever the end 
might be. Petersburg had fallen, Richmond was in 
flames behind them, the Confederacy was, perhaps, 
buried in the ruins of its Capitol, but Lee was still 
somewhere to the front, so his army followed.</p>
                  <p>“How long have we been marching, boys? I can't
	
<pb n="463"/>											
remember,” asked Dan, when, after a short rest; they 
formed again and started forward over the old road. 
In the tatters of his gray uniform, with his broken 
shoes tied on his feet and his black hair hanging 
across his eyes, he might have been one of the 
beggars who warm themselves in the sun of 
Southern countries.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, I reckon we left the Garden of Eden about 
six thousand years ago,” responded a wag from 
somewhere—he was too tired to recognize the voice. 
“There! the skirmishers have struck that blamed 
cavalry again. Plague them! They're as bad as   
wasps!”</p>
                  <p>“Has anybody some parched corn?” inquired 
Bland, plaintively. “I'll trade a whole raw ear for it. 
It makes my gums bleed so, I can't chew it.”</p>
                  <p>Dan plunged his hand into his pocket, and drew 
out the corn which he had shelled and parched at the 
last halt. As he exchanged it for the “whole raw 
ear,” he fell to wondering vaguely what had become 
of Big Abel since that dim point in eternity when 
they had left the trenches that surrounded 
Petersburg. Then time was divided into periods of 
nights and days, now night and day alike were made 
up in breathless marching, in throwing out 
skirmishers against those “wasps” of cavalrymen, 
and in trying to force aching teeth to grind parched 
corn. Panting and sick with hunger, he struggled on 
like a driven beast that sees the place ahead, where 
he must turn and grapple for the end with the 
relentless hunter on his track.</p>
                  <p>As the day ended the moist wind gathered 
strength and sang in his ears as he crept forward—
<pb n="464"/>											
now sleeping, now waking, for a time filled with 
warm memories of his college life, and again 
fighting over the last hopeless campaign from the 
Wilderness to the trenches where Petersburg had 
fallen. They had yielded step by step, but the great 
hunter had pressed on, and now the thin brigades 
were gathering for the last stand together.</p>
                  <p>Overhead he heard the soughing of the pines, and 
around him the steady tramp of feet too tired to lift 
themselves from out the heavy mud. Straight above 
in the muffled sky a star shone dimly, and for a time 
he watched it in his effort to keep awake. Then he 
began on the raw corn in his pocket, shelling it from 
the cob as he walked along; but when the taste of 
blood rose to his lips, he put the ear away again, and 
stooped to rub his eyes with a handful of damp 
earth. Then, at last, in sheer desperation, he loosened 
the grip upon his thoughts, and stumbled on, 
between waking and sleeping, into the darkness that 
lay ahead.</p>
                  <p>In the road before him the door at Chericoke 
opened wide as on the old Christmas Eves, and he 
saw the Major and the Governor draining their 
glasses under the garlands of mistletoe and holly, 
while Betty and Virginia, in dresses of white 
tarleton, stood against the ruddy glow that filled the 
panelled parlour. The cheerful Christmas smell was 
in the air—the smell of apple toddy, of roasted 
turkey, of plum pudding in a blaze of alcohol. As he 
entered after his long ride from college, Betty came 
up to him and slipped a warm white hand into his 
cold one, while he met the hazel beams from beneath 
her lashes.</p>
                  <pb n="465"/>
                  <p>“I hope you have brought Jack Morson,” she said. 
“Virginia is waiting. See how lovely she looks in her 
white flounces, with the string of coral about her 
neck.”</p>
                  <p>“But the war, Betty?” he asked, with blinking 
eyes, and as he put out his hand to touch the pearls 
upon her bosom, he saw that it was whole again—
no wound was there, only the snowflakes that fell 
from his sleeve upon her breast. “What of the war, 
dear? I must go back to the army.”</p>
                  <p>Betty laughed long and merrily.</p>
                  <p>“Why, you're dreaming, Dan,” she said. “It all 
comes of those wicked stories of the Major's. In a 
moment you will believe that this is really 1812, and 
you've gone without your rations.”</p>
                  <p>“Thank God!” he cried aloud, and the sound of 
his own voice woke him, as he slipped and went 
down in a mudhole upon the road. The Christmas 
smell faded from his nostrils; in its place came the 
smoke from Pinetop's pipe—a faithful friend until 
the last. Overhead the star was still shining, and to 
the front he heard a single shot from the hovering 
cavalry, withdrawing for the night.</p>
                  <p>“God damn this mud!” called a man behind him, 
as he lurched sideways from the ranks. Farther away 
three hoarse voices, the remnant of a once famous 
glee club, were singing in the endeavour to scare off 
sleep:—</p>
                  <p>“Rally round the flag, boys, rally once again!”</p>
                  <p>And suddenly he was fighting in the tangles of the 
Wilderness, crouching behind a charred oak stump, 
while he loaded and fired at the little puffs of
<pb n="466"/>											
smoke that rose from the undergrowth beyond. He saw 
the low marshland, the stunted oaks and pines, and the 
heavy creepers that were pushed aside and trampled 
underfoot, and at his feet he saw a company officer with 
a bullet hole through his forehead and a covering of pine 
needles upon his face. About him the small twigs fell, as 
if a storm swept the forest, and as he dodged, like a 
sharpshooter from tree to tree, he saw a rush of flame 
and smoke in the distance where the woods were 
burning. Above the noise of the battle, he heard the 
shrieks of the wounded men in the track of the fire; and 
once he met a Union and a Confederate soldier, each 
shot through the leg, drawing each other back from the 
approaching flames. Then, as he passed on, tearing at 
the cartridges with his teeth, he came upon a sergeant in 
Union clothes, sitting against a pine stump with his 
cocked rifle in his hand, and his eyes on the wind-blown 
smoke. A moment before the man may have gone down 
at his shot, he knew—and yet, as he looked, an instinct 
stronger than the instinct to kill was alive within him, 
and he rushed on, dragging his enemy with him from 
the terrible woods. “I hope you are not much hurt,” he 
said, as he placed him on the ground and ran back to 
where the line was charging.“ One life has been paid 
for,” he thought, as he rushed on to kill—and fell face 
downward on the wheel-ruts of the old road.</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Rally round the flag, boys, rally once again,”</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>sang the three hoarse voices, straining against the wind.</p>
                  <pb n="467"/>
                  <p>Dan struggled to his feet, and the scene shifted.</p>
                  <p>He was back in his childhood, and the Major had 
just brought in a slave he had purchased from 
Rainy-day Jones—“the plague spot in the county,” 
as the angry old gentleman declared.</p>
                  <p>Dan sat on the pile of kindling wood upon the 
kitchen hearth and stared at the poor black creature 
shivering in the warmth, his face distorted with 
the toothache, and a dirty rag about his jaw. He 
heard Aunt Rhody snorting indignantly as she basted 
the turkeys, and he watched his grandmother 
bustling back and forth with whiskey and hot 
plasters.</p>
                  <p>“Who made slavery, sir?” asked the boy suddenly, 
his hands in his breeches pockets and his head bent 
sideways.</p>
                  <p>The Major started.</p>
                  <p>“God, sir,” he promptly replied.</p>
                  <p>“Then I think it very strange of God,” said the 
boy, “and when I grow up, I shall set them all free, 
grandpa—I shall set them free even if I have to 
fight to do it, sir.”</p>
                  <p>“What!  like poor free Levi?” stormed the 
Major.</p>
                  <p>“Wake up, confound you!” bawled somebody in 
his ear. “You've lurched against my side until my 
ribs are sore. I say, are you going on forever, 
anyhow? We've halted for the night.”</p>
                  <p>“I can't stop!” cried Dan, groping in the 
darkness, then he fell heavily upon the damp ground, 
while a voice down the road began shouting, “Detail 
for guard!” Half asleep and cursing, the men 
responded to their names and hurried off, and as the
<pb n="468"/>											
silence closed in, the army slept like a child upon the 
roadside.</p>
                  <p>With the first glimmer of dawn they were on the 
march again, passing all day through the desolate 
flat country, where the women ran weeping to the 
doorways, and waved empty hands as they went by. 
Once a girl in a homespun dress, with a spray of 
apple blossoms in her black hair, brought out a 
wooden bucket filled with buttermilk and passed it 
along the line.</p>
                  <p>“Fight to the end, boys,” she cried defiantly,        
“and when the end comes, keep on fighting. If you 
go back on Lee there's not a woman in Virginia will 
touch your hand.”</p>
                  <p>“That's right, little gal!” shrieked a husky 
private.“Three cheers for Marse Robert! an' we'll 
whip the earth in our bar' feet befo' breakfast.”</p>
                  <p>“All the same I wish old Stonewall was along,” 
muttered Pinetop. “If I could jest see old Stonewall 
or his ghost ahead, I'd know thar was an open road 
somewhere that Sheridan ain't got his eye on.”</p>
                  <p>As the sun rose high, refugees from Richmond 
flocked after them to shout that the town had been 
fired by the citizens, who had moved, with their 
families, to the Capitol Square as the flames spread 
from the great tobacco warehouses. Men who had 
wives and children in the city groaned as they 
marched farther from the ashes of their homes, and 
more than one staggered back into the ranks and 
went onward under a heavier burden.</p>
                  <p>“Wall, I reckon things are fur the best—or they 
ain't,” remarked Pinetop, in a cheerful tone.</p>
                  <pb n="469"/>
                  <p>“Thar's no goin' agin that, you bet. What's the row 
back thar, I wonder?”</p>
                  <p>The hovering enemy, grown bolder, had fallen upon 
the flank, and the stragglers and the rear guard were 
beating off the cavalry, when a regiment was sent 
back to relieve the pressure. Returning, Pinetop, 
who was of the attacking party, fell gravely to 
moralizing upon the scarcity of food.</p>
                  <p>“I've tasted every plagued thing that grows in this 
country except dirt,” he observed, “an' I'm goin' to 
kneel down presently and take a good square 
mouthful of that.”</p>
                  <p>“That's one thing we shan't run short of,” replied 
Dan, stepping round a mud hole. “By George, we've 
got to march in a square again across this open. I 
believe when I set out for heaven, I'll find some of 
those confounded Yankee troopers watching the 
road.”</p>
                  <p>Forming in battle line they advanced cautiously 
across the clearing, while the skirmishing grew 
brisker at the front. That night they halted but once 
upon the way, standing to meet attack against a strip 
of pines, watching with drawn breath while the 
enemy crept closer. They heard him in the woods, 
felt him in the air, saw him in the darkness—like a 
gigantic coil he approached inch by inch for the last 
struggle. Now and then a shot rang out, and the little 
band thrilled to a soldier, and waited breathlessly for 
the last charge that might end it all.</p>
                  <p>“There's only one thing worse than starvation, 
and it's defeat!” cried Dan aloud; then the column 
swung on and the cry of “Close up, there! close
<pb n="470"/>										
up!”  mingled in his ears with the steady tramp 
upon the road.</p>
                  <p>In the early morning the shots grew faster, and as 
the column stopped in the cover of a wood, the 
bullets came singing among the tree-tops, from the 
left flank where the skirmishers had struck the 
enemy. During the short rest Dan slept leaning 
against a twisted aspen, and when Pinetop shook 
him, he awoke with a dizziness in his head that sent 
the flat earth slamming against the sky.</p>
                  <p>“I believe I'm starving, Pinetop,” he said, and his 
voice rang like a bell in his ears. “I can't see where 
to put my feet, the ground slips about so.”</p>
                  <p>For answer Pinetop felt in his pocket and brought 
out a slice of fat bacon, which he gave to him 
uncooked.</p>
                  <p>“Wait till I git a light,” he commanded. “A 
woman up the road gave me a hunk, and I've had my 
share.”</p>
                  <p>“You've had your share,” repeated Dan, greedily, 
his eyes on the meat, though he knew that Pinetop 
was lying.</p>
                  <p>The mountaineer struck a match and lighted a bit 
of pine, holding the bacon to the flame until it 
scorched.</p>
                  <p>“You'd better git it all in yo' mouth quick,” he 
advised, “for if the smell once starts on the breeze 
the whole brigade will be on the scent in a minute.”</p>
                  <p>Dan ate it to the last morsel and licked the warm 
juice from his fingers.</p>
                  <p>“You lied, Pinetop,” he said, “but, by God, you
<pb n="471"/>											
saved my life. What place is this, I wonder. Isn't 
there any hope of our cutting through Grant's lines 
to-day?”</p>
                  <p>Pinetop glanced about him.</p>
                  <p>“Somebody said we were comin' on to Sailor's 
Creek,” he answered, “and it's about as God-forsaken 
country as I care to see. Hello! what's 
that?”</p>
                  <p>In the road there was an abandoned battery, cut 
down and left to rot into the earth, and as they swept 
past it at “double quick,” they heard the sound of 
rapid firing across the little stream.</p>
                  <p>“It's a fight, thank God!” yelled Pinetop, and at 
the words a tumultuous joy urged Dan through the 
water and over the sharp stones. After all the hunger 
and the intolerable waiting, a chance was come for 
him to use his musket once again.</p>
                  <p>As they passed through an open meadow, a rabbit, 
starting suddenly from a clump of sumach, went 
bounding through the long grass before the thin gray 
line. With ears erect and short white tail bobbing 
among the broom-sedge, the little quivering creature 
darted straight toward the low brow of a hill, where 
a squadron of cavalry made a blue patch on the 
green.</p>
                  <p>“Geriminy! thar goes a good dinner,” Pinetop 
gasped, smacking his lips. “An' I've got to save this 
here load for a Yankee I can't eat.”</p>
                  <p>With a long flying leap the rabbit led the charge 
straight into the enemy's ranks, and as the squirrel 
rifles rang out behind it, a blue horseman was swept 
from every saddle upon the hill.</p>
                  <p>“By God, I'm glad I didn't eat that rabbit!”
<pb n="472"/>											
yelled Pinetop, as he reloaded and raised his musket 
to his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>Back and forth before the line, the general of the 
brigade was riding bareheaded and frantic with 
delight. As he passed he made sweeping gestures 
with his left hand, and his long gray hair floated like 
a banner upon the wind.</p>
                  <p>“They're coming, men!” he cried. “Get behind 
that fence and have your muskets ready to pick your 
man. When you see the whites of his eyes fire, and 
give the bayonet. They're coming! Here they are!”</p>
                  <p>The old “worm” fence went down, and as Dan 
piled up some loose rails before him, a creeping 
brier tore his fingers until the blood spurted upon his 
sleeve. Then, kneeling on the ground, he raised his 
musket and fired at one of the skirmishers advancing 
briskly through the broom-sedge. In an instant the 
meadow and the hill beyond were blue with 
swarming infantry, and the little gray band fell back, 
step by step, loading and firing as it went across the 
field. As the road behind it closed, Dan turned to 
battle on his own account, and entering a thinned 
growth of pines, he dodged from tree to tree and 
aimed above the brushwood. Near him the colour 
bearer of the regiment was fighting with his flagstaff 
for a weapon, and out in the meadow a member of 
the glee club, crouching behind a clump of sassafras 
as he loaded, was singing in a cracked voice:—</p>
                  <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
                     <l part="N">“Rally round the flag, boys, rally once again!”</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Then a bullet went with a soft thud into the singer's
<pb n="473"/>											
breast, and the cracked voice was choked out beneath 
the bushes.</p>
                  <p>Gripped by a sudden pity for the helpless flag he had 
loved and followed for four years, Dan made an 
impetuous dash from out the pines, and tearing the 
colours from the pole, tossed them over his arm as he 
retreated rapidly to cover. At the instant he held his life 
as nothing beside the faded strip of silk that wrapped 
about his body. The cause for which he had fought, the 
great captain he had followed, the devotion to a single 
end which had kept him struggling in the ranks, the 
daily sacrifice, the very poverty and cold and hunger, all 
these were bound up and made one with the tattered flag 
upon his arm. Through the belt of pines, down the 
muddy road, across the creek and up the long hill, he 
fell back breathlessly, loading and firing as he went, 
with his face turned toward the enemy. At the end he 
became like a fox before the hunters, dashing madly 
over the rough ground, with the colours blown out 
behind him, and the quick shots ringing in his ears.</p>
                  <p>Then, as if by a single stroke, Lee's army vanished 
from the trampled broom-sedge and the strip of pines. 
The blue brigades closed upon the landscape and when 
they opened there were only a group of sullen prisoners 
and the sound of stray shots from the scattered soldiers 
who had fought their way beyond  the stream.</p>

                  <head>IN THE HOUR OF DEFEAT</head>
                  <p>As the dusk fell Dan found himself on the road 
with a little company of stragglers, flying from the 
pursuing cavalry that drew off slowly as the 
darkness gathered. He had lost his regiment, and, as 
he went on, he began calling out familiar names, 
listening with strained ears for an answer that would 
tell of a friend's escape. At last he caught the 
outlines of a gigantic figure relieved on a hillock 
against the pale green west, and, with a shout, he 
hurried through the swarm of fugitives, and overtook 
Pinetop, who had stooped to tie his shoe on with a 
leather strap.</p>
                  <p>“Thank God, old man!” he cried. “Where are the 
others?”</p>
                  <p>Pinetop, panting yet imperturbable, held out a 
steady hand.</p>
                  <p>“The Lord knows,” he replied.“Some of 'em air 
here an' some ain't. I was goin' back agin to git the 
flag, when I saw you chased like a fox across the 
creek with it hangin' on yo' back. Then I kinder 
thought it wouldn't do for none of the regiment to 
answer when Marse Robert called, so I came along 
right fast and kep' hopin' you would follow.”</p>
                  <p>“Here I am,” responded Dan, “and here are the
<pb n="475"/>											
colours.” He twined the silk more closely about his 
arm, gloating over his treasure in the twilight.</p>
                  <p>Pinetop stretched out his great rough hand and 
touched the flag as gently as if it were a woman.</p>
                  <p>“I've fought under this here thing goin' on four 
years now,” he said, “and I reckon when they take it 
prisoner, they take me along with it.”</p>
                  <p>“And me,” added Dan; “poor Granger went 
down, you know, just as I took it from him. He fell 
fighting with the pole.”</p>
                  <p>“Wall, it's a better way than most,” Pinetop 
replied, “an' when the angel begins to foot up my 
account on Jedgment Day, I shouldn't mind his 
cappin' the whole list with ‘he lost his life, but he 
didn't lose his flag.’ To make a blamed good fight is 
what the Lord wants of us, I reckon, or he wouldn't 
have made our hands itch so when they touch a 
musket.”</p>
                  <p>Then they trudged on silently, weak from hunger, 
sickened by defeat. When, at last, the disorganized 
column halted, and the men fell to the ground upon 
their rifles, Dan kindled a fire and parched his corn 
above the coals. After it was eaten they lay down 
side by side and slept peacefully on the edge of an 
old field.</p>
                  <p>For three days they marched steadily onward, 
securing meagre rations in a little town where they 
rested for a while, and pausing from time to time, 
to beat off a feigned attack. Pinetop, cheerful, 
strong, undaunted by any hardship, set his face 
unflinchingly toward the battle that must clear a 
road for them through Grant's lines. Had he met 
alone a squadron of cavalry in the field, he would,
<pb n="476"/>											
probably, have taken his stand against a pine, and 
aimed his musket as coolly as if a squirrel were the 
mark. With his sunny temper, and his gloomy gospel 
of predestination, his heart could swell with hope 
even while he fought single-handed in the face of big 
battalions. What concerned him, after all, was not so 
much the chance of an ultimate victory for the cause, 
as the determination in his own mind to fight it out 
as long as he had a cartridge remaining in his box. 
As his fathers had kept the frontier, so he meant, on 
his own account, to keep Virginia.</p>
                  <p>On the afternoon of the third day, as the little 
company drew near to Appomattox Court House, it 
found the road blocked with abandoned guns, and 
lined by exhausted stragglers, who had gone down at 
the last halting place. As it filed into an open field 
beyond a wooded level, where a few campfires 
glimmered, a group of Federal horsemen clattered 
across the front, and, as if by instinct, the column 
formed into battle line, and the hand of every man 
was on the trigger of his musket.</p>
                  <p>“Don't fire, you fools!” called an officer 
behind them, in a voice sharp with irritation. “The army 
has surrendered!”</p>
                  <p>“What! Grant surrendered?” thundered the line, 
with muskets at a trail as it rushed into the open.</p>
                  <p>“No, you blasted fools—we've surrendered,” 
shouted the voice, rising hoarsely in a gasping 
indignation.</p>
                  <p>“Surrendered,  the deuce!” Scoffed the men, as
<pb n="477"/>											
they fell back into ranks.“I'd like to know what 
General Lee will think of your surrender?”</p>
                  <p>A little Colonel, with his hand at his sword hilt, 
strutted up and down before a tangle of dead thistles.</p>
                  <p>“I don't know what he thinks of it, he did it,” he 
shrieked, without pausing in his walk.</p>
                  <p>“It's a damn lie!” cried Dan, in a white heat. Then 
he threw his musket on the ground, and fell to sobbing 
the dry tearless sobs of a man who feels his heart 
crushed by a sudden blow.</p>
                  <p>There were tears on all the faces round him, and 
Pinetop was digging his great fists into his eyes, as a 
child does who has been punished before his playmates. 
Beside him a man with an untrimmed shaggy beard hid 
his distorted features in shaking hands.</p>
                  <p>“I ain't blubberin' fur myself,” he said defiantly,        
“but—O Lord, boys—I'm cryin' fur Marse Robert.”</p>
                  <p>Over the field the beaten soldiers, in ragged gray 
uniforms, were lying beneath little bushes of sassafras 
and sumach, and to the right a few campfires were 
burning in a shady thicket. The struggle was over, and 
each man had fallen where he stood, hopeless for the 
first time in four long years. Up and down the road 
groups of Federal horsemen trotted with cheerful 
unconcern, and now and then a private paused to make a 
remark in friendly tones; but the men beneath the bushes 
only stared with hollow eyes in answer—the blank stare 
of the defeated who have put their whole strength into 
the fight.</p>
                  <pb n="478"/>
                  <p>Taking out his jack-knife, Dan unfastened the 
flag from the hickory pole on which he had placed it, 
and began cutting it into little pieces, which he 
passed to each man who had fought beneath its 
folds. The last bit he put into his own pocket, and 
trembling like one gone suddenly palsied, passed 
from the midst of his silent comrades to a pine stump 
on the border of the woods. Here he sat down and 
looked hopelessly upon the scene before him—upon 
the littered roads and the great blue lines encircling 
the horizon.</p>
                  <p>So this was the end, he told himself, with a 
bitterness that choked him like a grip upon the 
throat, this the end of his boyish ardour, his dream 
of fame upon the battle-field, his four years of daily 
sacrifice and suffering. This was the end of the flag 
for which he was ready to give his life three days 
ago. With his youth, his strength, his very bread 
thrown into the scale, he sat now with wrecked body 
and blighted mind, and saw his future turn to decay 
before his manhood was well begun. Where was the 
old buoyant spirit he had brought with him into the 
fight? Gone forever, and in its place he found his 
maimed and trembling hands, and limbs weakened 
by starvation as by long fever. His virile youth was 
wasted in the slow struggle, his energy was sapped 
drop by drop; and at the last he saw himself burned 
out like the battle-fields, where the armies had closed 
and opened, leaving an impoverished and ruined soil. 
He had given himself for four years, and yet when the end 
came he had not earned so much as an empty title to take 
home for his reward. The consciousness of a hard
<pb n="479"/>											
fought fight was but the common portion of them 
all, from the greatest to the humblest on either side. 
As for him he had but done his duty like his 
comrades in the ranks, and by what right of merit 
should he have raised himself above their heads? 
Yes, this was the end, and he meant to face it 
standing with his back against the wall.</p>
                  <p>Down the road a line of Federal privates came 
driving an ox before them, and he eyed them 
gravely, wondering in a dazed way if the taste of 
victory had gone to their heads. Then he turned 
slowly, for a voice was speaking at his side, and a 
tall man in a long blue coat was building a little fire 
hard by.</p>
                  <p>“Your stomach's pretty empty, ain't it, Johnny?” he 
inquired, as he laid the sticks crosswise with precise 
movements, as if he had measured the length of each 
separate piece of wood. He was lean and rawboned, 
with a shaggy red moustache and a wart on his left 
cheek. When he spoke he showed an even row of 
strong white teeth.</p>
                  <p>Dan looked at him with a kind of exhausted 
indignation.</p>
                  <p>“Well, it's been emptier,” he returned shortly.</p>
                  <p>The man in blue struck a match and held it carefully 
to a dried pine branch, watching, with a serious face, 
as the flame licked the rosin from the crossed sticks. 
Then he placed a quart pot full of water on the coals, 
and turned to meet Dan's eyes, which had grown 
ravenous as he caught the scent of beef.</p>
                  <p>“You see we somehow thought you Johnnies 
would be hard up,” he said in an offhand manner,
<pb n="480"/>											
“so we made up our minds we'd ask you to dinner 
and cut our rations square. Some of us are driving 
over an ox from camp, but as I was hanging round 
and saw you all by yourself on this old stump, I had 
a feeling that you were in need of a cup of coffee. 
You haven't tasted real coffee for some time, I 
guess.”</p>
                  <p>The water was bubbling over and he measured out 
the coffee and poured it slowly into the quart cup. 
As the aroma filled the air, he opened his haversack 
and drew out a generous supply of raw beef which 
he broiled on little sticks, and laid on a spread of 
army biscuits. The larger share he offered to Dan 
with the steaming pot of coffee.</p>
                  <p>“I declare it'll do me downright good to see you 
eat,” he said, with a hospitable gesture.</p>
                  <p>Dan sat down beside the bread and beef, and, for 
the next ten minutes, ate like a famished wolf, while 
the man in blue placidly regarded him. When he had 
finished he took out a little bag of Virginian tobacco 
and they smoked together beside the waning fire. A 
natural light returned gradually to Dan's eyes, and 
while the clouds of smoke rose high above the 
bushes, they talked of the last great battles as quietly 
as of the Punic Wars. It was all dead now, as dead 
as history, and the men who fought had left the 
bitterness to the camp followers or to the ones who 
stayed at home.</p>
                  <p>“You have fine tobacco down this way,” 
observed the Union soldier, as he refilled his pipe, 
and lighted it with an ember. Then his gaze followed 
Dan's, which was resting on the long blue lines that 
stretched across the landscape.</p>
                  <pb n="481"/>
                  <p>“You're feeling right bad about us now,” he 
pursued, as he crossed his legs and leaned back 
against a pine, “and I guess it's natural, but the time 
will come when you'll know that we weren't the 
worst you had to face.”</p>
                  <p>Dan held out his hand with something of a smile.</p>
                  <p>“It was a fair fight and I can shake hands,” he 
responded.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I don't mean that,” said the other 
thoughtfully. “What I mean is just this, you mark 
my words—after the battle comes the vultures. After 
the army of fighters comes the army of those who 
haven't smelled the powder. And in time you'll learn 
that it isn't the man with the rifle that does the most 
of the mischief. The damned coffee boilers will get 
their hands in now—I know 'em.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, there's nothing left, I suppose, but to 
swallow it down without any fuss,” said Dan 
wearily, looking over the field where the slaughtered 
ox was roasting on a hundred bayonets at a hundred 
fires.</p>
                  <p>“You're right, that's the only thing,” agreed the 
man in blue; then his keen gray eyes were on Dan's 
face.</p>
                  <p>“Have you got a wife?” he asked bluntly.</p>
                  <p>Dan shook his head as he stared gravely at the 
embers.</p>
                  <p>“A sweetheart, I guess? I never met a Johnnie 
who didn't have a sweetheart.”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, I've a sweetheart—God bless her!”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you take my advice and go home and tell 
her to cure you, now she's got the chance. I
<pb n="482"/>											
like your face, young man, but if I ever saw a 
half-starved and sickly one, it is yours. Why, I 
shouldn't have thought you had the strength to raise 
your rifle.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, it doesn't take much strength for that; and 
besides the coffee did me good, I was only hungry.”</p>
                  <p>“Hungry, hump!” grunted the Union soldier. “It 
takes more than hunger to give a man that blue look 
about the lips; it takes downright starvation.”He 
dived into his haversack and drew out a quinine pill 
and a little bottle of whiskey.</p>
                  <p>“If you'll just chuck this down it won't do you any 
harm,” he went on, “and if I were you, I'd find a 
shelter before I went to sleep to-night; you can't trust 
April weather. Get into that cow shed over there or 
under a wagon.”</p>
                  <p>Dan swallowed the quinine and the whiskey, and 
as the strong spirit fired his veins, the utter 
hopelessness of his outlook muffled him into silence. 
Dropping his head into his open palms, he sat dully 
staring at the whitening ashes.</p>
                  <p>After a moment the man in blue rose to his feet and 
fastened his haversack.</p>
                  <p>“I live up by Bethlehem, New Hampshire,” he 
remarked, “and if you ever come that way, I hope 
you'll look me up; my name's Moriarty.”</p>
                  <p>“Your name's Moriarty, I shall remember,” 
repeated Dan, trying, with a terrible effort, to steady 
his quivering limbs.</p>
                  <p>“Jim Moriarty, don't you forget it. Anybody at 
Bethlehem can tell you about me; I keep the biggest 
store around there.” He went off a few steps
<pb n="483"/>											
and then came back to hold out an awkward hand 
in which there was a little heap of silver.</p>
                  <p>“You'd just better take this to start you on your 
way,” he said, “it ain't but ninety-five cents—I 
couldn't make out the dollar—and when you get it in 
again you can send it to Jim Moriarty at Bethlehem, 
New Hampshire. Good-by, and good luck to you this 
time.”</p>
                  <p>He strode off across the field, and Dan, with the 
silver held close in his palm, flung himself back 
upon the ground and slept until Pinetop woke him 
with a grasp upon his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>Struggling to his feet Dan rushed from the woods 
across the deserted field, to the lines of conquered 
soldiers standing in battle ranks upon the roadside. 
Between them the Commander had passed slowly on 
his dapple gray horse, and when Dan joined the 
ranks it was only in time to see him ride onward at a 
walk, with the bearded soldiers clinging like children 
to his stirrups. A group of Federal cavalrymen, 
drawn up beneath a persimmon tree, uncovered as he 
went by, and he returned the salute with a simple 
gesture. Lonely, patient, confirmed in courtesy, he 
passed on his way; and his little army returned to 
camp in the strip of pines.</p>
                  <p>“‘I've done my best for you,’ that's what he said,” 
sobbed Pinetop. “‘I've done my best for you,’—and 
I kissed old Traveller's mane.”</p>
                  <p>Without replying, Dan went back into the woods 
and flung himself down on the spread of tags. Now 
that the fight was over all the exhaustion of
<pb n="484"/>											
the last four years, the weakness after many battles, 
the weariness after the long marches, had gathered 
with accumulated strength for the final overthrow.</p>
                  <p>For three days he remained in camp in the pine 
woods, and on the third, after waiting six hours in a 
hard rain outside his General's tent, he secured the 
little printed slip which signified to all whom it 
might concern that he had become a prisoner upon 
his parole. Then, after a sympathetic word to the rest 
of the division, shivering beneath the sassafras 
bushes before the tent, he shook hands with his 
comrades under arms, and started with Pinetop down 
the muddy road. The war was over, and foot-sore, in 
rags and with aching limbs, he was returning to the 
little valley where he had hoped to trail his glory.</p>
                  <p>Down the long road the gray rain fell straight as a 
curtain, and on either side tramped the lines of 
beaten soldiers who were marching, on their word of 
honour, to their distant homes. The abandoned guns 
sunk deep in the mud, the shivering men lying in 
rags beneath the bushes, and the charred remains of 
campfires among the trees were the last memories 
Dan carried from the four years' war.</p>
                  <p>Some miles farther on, when the pickets had been 
passed, a man on a black horse rode suddenly from 
a little thicket and stopped across their path.</p>
                  <p>“You fellows haven't been such darn fools as to 
give your parole, have you?” he asked in an angry 
voice, his hand on his horse's neck. “The fight isn't 
over yet and we want your muskets on our side. I 
belong to the partisan rangers, and we'll cut
<pb n="485"/>											
through to Johnston's army before daylight. If not, 
we'll take to the mountains and keep up the war 
forever. The country is ours, what's to hinder us?”</p>
                  <p>He spoke passionately, and at each sharp 
exclamation the black horse rose on his haunches 
and pawed the air.</p>
                  <p>Dan shook his head.</p>
                  <p>“I'm out on parole,” he replied, “but as soon as 
I'm exchanged, I'll fight if Virginia wants me. How 
about you, Pinetop?”</p>
                  <p>The mountaineer shuffled his feet in the mud and 
stood solemnly surveying the landscape.</p>
                  <p>“Wall, I don't understand much about this here 
parole business,” he replied. “It seems to me that a 
slip of paper with printed words on it that I have to 
spell out as I go, is a mighty poor way to keep a 
man from fightin' if he can find a musket. I ain't 
steddyin' about this parole, but Marse Robert told 
me to go home to plant my crop, and I am goin' 
home to plant it.”</p>
                  <p>“It is all over, I think,” said Dan with a quivering 
lip, as he stared at the ruined meadows. The smart 
was still fresh, and it was too soon for him to add, 
with the knowledge that would come to him from 
years,—“it is better so.” Despite the grim struggle 
and the wasted strength, despite the impoverished 
land and the nameless graves that filled it, despite 
even his own wrecked youth and the hard-fought 
fields where he had laid it down—despite all these a 
shadow was lifted from his people and it was worth 
the price.</p>
                  <p>They passed on, while the black horse pawed the 
dust, and the rider hurled oaths at their retreating
<pb n="486"/>											
figures. At a little house a few yards down the road 
they stopped to ask for food, and found a woman 
weeping at the kitchen table, with three small 
children clinging to her skirts. Her husband had 
fallen at Five Forks, she said, the safe was empty, 
and the children were crying for bread. Then Dan 
slipped into her hand the silver he had borrowed 
from the Union soldier, and the two returned 
penniless to the road.</p>
                  <p>“At least we are men,” he said almost 
apologetically to Pinetop, and the next instant turned 
squarely in the mud, for a voice from the other side 
had called out shrilly:—</p>
                  <p>“Hi, Marse Dan, whar you gwine now?”</p>
                  <p>“Bless my soul, it's Big Abel,” he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>Black as a spade and beaming with delight, the 
negro emerged from the swarm upon the roadside 
and grasped Dan's outstretched hands.</p>
                  <p>“Whar you gwine dis away, Marse Dan?” he 
inquired again.</p>
                  <p>“I'm going home, Big Abel,” responded Dan, as 
they walked on in a row of three. “No, don't shout, 
you scamp; I'd rather lie down and die upon the 
roadside than go home like this.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, you ain' much to look at, dat's sho',” 
replied Big Abel, his face shining like polished 
ebony, “en I ain' much to look at needer, but dey'll 
have ter recollect de way we all wuz befo' we runned 
away; dey'll have ter recollect you in yo' fine shuts 
en fancy waistcoats, en dey'll have ter recollect me in 
yo' ole uns. Sakes alive! I kin see dat one er yourn 
wid de little bit er flow'rs all over hit des plain es ef 
'twuz yestiddy.”</p>
                  <pb n="487"/>
                  <p>“The waistcoats are all gone now,” said Dan 
gravely, “and so are the shirts. The war is over and 
you are your own master, Big Abel. You don't 
belong to me from this time on.”</p>
                  <p>Big Abel shook his head grinning.</p>
                  <p>“I reckon hit's all de same,” he remarked cheerfully, 
“en I reckon we'd es well be gwine on home, Marse 
Dan.”</p>
                  <p>“I reckon we would,” said Dan, and they pushed 
on in silence.</p>

                  <head>ON THE MARCH AGAIN</head>
                  <p>THAT night they slept on the blood-stained floor of an 
old field hospital, and the next morning Pinetop parted 
from them and joined an engineer who had promised him 
a “lift” toward his mountains.</p>
                  <p>As Dan stood in the sunny road holding his friend's 
rough hand, it seemed to him that such a parting was the 
sharpest wrench the end had brought.</p>
                  <p>“Whenever you need me, old fellow, remember that I 
am always ready,” he said in a husky voice.</p>
                  <p>Pinetop looked past him to the distant woods, and his 
calm blue eyes were dim.</p>
                  <p>“I reckon you'll go yo' way an' I'll go mine,” he 
replied, “for thar's one thing sartain an' that is our ways 
don't run together. It'll never be the same agin—that's 
natur—but if you ever want a good stout hand for any 
uphill ploughing or shoot yo' man an' the police git on yo'  
back, jest remember that I'm up thar in my little cabin. 
Why, if every officer in the county was at yo' heels, I'd 
stand guard with my old squirrel gun and maw would 
with her kettle.”</p>
                  <p>Then he shook hands with Big Abel and strode on 
across a field to a little railway station. while
<pb n="489"/>											
Dan went slowly down the road with the negro at his 
side.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon when they had trudged all the 
morning through the heavy mud, they reached a 
small frame house set back from the road, with some 
straggling ailanthus shoots at the front and a pile of 
newly cut hickory logs near the kitchen steps. A 
woman, with a bucket of soapsuds at her feet, was 
wringing out a homespun shirt in the yard, and as 
they entered the little gate, she looked at them with a 
defiance which was evidently the result of a late 
domestic wrangle.</p>
                  <p>“I've got one man on my hands,” she began in a 
shrill voice, “an' he's as much as I can 'tend to, an' a 
long sight mo' than I care to 'tend to. He never had 
the spunk to fight anythin' except his wife, but I 
reckon he's better off now than them that had; it's 
the coward that gets the best of things in these days.”</p>
                  <p>“Shut up thar, you hussy!” growled a voice from 
the kitchen, and a fat man with bleared eyes 
slouched to the doorway. “I reckon if you want a 
supper you can work for it,” he remarked, taking a 
wad of tobacco from his mouth and aiming it 
deliberately at one of the ailanthus shoots. “You 
split up that thar pile of logs back thar an' Sally'll 
cook yo' supper. Thar ain't another house inside of a 
good ten miles, so you'd better take your chance, I 
reckon.”</p>
                  <p>“That's jest like you, Tom Bates,” retorted the 
woman passionately. “Befo' you'd do a lick of 
honest work you'd let the roof topple plum down 
upon our heads.”</p>
                  <pb n="490"/>
                  <p>For an instant Dan's glance cut the man like a 
whip, then crossing to the woodpile, he lifted the axe 
and sent it with a clean stroke into a hickory log.</p>
                  <p>“We can't starve, Big Abel,” he said coolly,       
“but we are not beggars yet by a long way.”</p>
                  <p>“Go 'way, Marse Dan,” protested the negro in 
disgust. “Gimme dat ar axe en set right down and 
wait twel supper. You're des es white es a sheet dis 
minute.”</p>
                  <p>“I've got to begin some day,” returned Dan, as the 
axe swung back across his shoulder. “I'll pay for 
my supper and you'll pay for yours, that's fair, isn't 
it?—for you're a free man now.”</p>
                  <p>Then he went feverishly to work, while Big Abel 
sat grumbling on the doorstep, and the farmer, 
leaning against the lintel behind him, watched the 
lessening pile with sluggish eyes.</p>
                  <p>“You be real careful of this wood, Sally, an' it 
ought to last twel summer,” he observed, as he 
glanced to where his wife stood wringing out the 
clothes.  “If you warn't so wasteful that last pile 
would ha' held out twice as long.”</p>
                  <p>Dan chopped steadily for an hour, and then 
giving the axe to Big Abel, went into the little 
kitchen to eat his supper. The woman served him 
sullenly, placing some sobby biscuits and a piece of 
cold bacon on his plate, and pouring out a glass of 
buttermilk with a vicious thrust of the pitcher. When 
he asked if there was a shelter close at hand where 
he might sleep, she replied sourly that she reckoned 
the barn was good enough if he chose to spend the 
night there. Then as Big Abel finished
<pb n="491"/>											
his job and took his supper in his hand, they left the 
house and went across the darkening cattle pen, to a 
rotting structure which they took to be the barn. 
Inside the straw was warm and dry, and as Dan flung 
himself down upon it, he gasped out something like a 
prayer of thanks. His first day's labour with his 
hands had left him trembling like a nervous woman. 
An hour longer, he told himself, and he should have 
gone down upon the roadside.</p>
                  <p>For a time he slept profoundly, and then awaking 
in the night, he lay until dawn listening to Big Abel's 
snores, and staring straight above where a solitary 
star shone through a crack in the shingled roof. 
From the other side of a thin partition came the soft 
breathing and the fresh smell of cows, and, now and 
then, he heard the low bleating of a new-born calf.</p>
                  <p>He had been dreaming of a battle, and the 
impression was so vivid that, as he opened his 
eyes, he half imagined he still heard the sound 
of shots. In his sleep he had saved the flag and 
won promotion after victory, and for a moment the 
trampled straw seemed to him to be the battle-field, 
and the thin boards against which he beat the 
enemy's resisting line. As he came slowly to himself 
a sudden yearning for the army awoke within him. He 
wanted the red campfires and his comrades smoking 
against the dim pines; the peaceful bivouac where 
the long shadows crept among the trees and two men 
lay wrapped together beneath every blanket; above 
all, he wanted to see the Southern Cross wave 
in the sunlight, and to hear the charging
<pb n="492"/>											
yell as the brigade dashed into the open. He was 
homesick for it all to-night, and yet it was dead 
forever—dead as his own youth which he had given 
to the cause.</p>
                  <p>Sharp pains racked him from head to foot, and his 
pulses burned as if from fever. It was like the 
weariness of old age, he thought, this utter 
hopelessness, these strained and quivering muscles. 
As a boy he had been hardy as an Indian and as 
fearless of fatigue. Now the long midnight gallops on 
Prince Rupert over frozen roads returned to him like 
the dim memories from some old romance. They 
belonged to the place of half-forgotten stories, with 
the gay waistcoats and the Christmas gatherings in 
the hall at Chericoke. For a country that was not he 
had given himself as surely as the men who were 
buried where they fought, and his future would be 
but one long struggle to adjust himself to conditions 
in which he had no part. His proper nature was 
compacted of the old life which was gone 
forever—of its ease, of its gayety, of its lavish 
pleasures. For the sake of this life he had fought for 
four years in the ranks, and now that it was swept 
away, he found himself like a man who stumbles on 
over the graves of his familiar friends. He 
remembered the words of the soldier in the long blue 
coat, and spoke them half aloud in the darkness:       
“There'll come a time when you'll find out that the 
army wasn't the worst you had to face.” The army 
was not the worst, he knew this now—the grapple 
with a courageous foe had served to quicken his 
pulse and nerve his hand—the worst
	
<pb n="493"/>											
was what came afterward, this sense of utter failure 
and the attempt to shape one's self to brutal 
necessity. In the future that opened before him he 
saw only a terrible patience which would perhaps 
grow into a second nature as the years went on. In 
place of the old generous existence, he must from this 
day forth wring the daily bread of those he loved, 
with maimed hands, from a wasted soil.</p>
                  <p>The thought of Betty came to him, but it brought 
no consolation. For himself he could meet the 
shipwreck standing, but Betty must be saved from it 
if there was salvation to be found. She had loved him 
in the days of his youth—in his strong days, as the 
Governor said—now that he was worn out, 
suffering, gray before his time, there was mere 
madness in his thought of her buoyant strength.        
“You may take ten—you may take twenty years to 
rebuild yourself,” a surgeon had said to him at 
parting; and he asked himself bitterly, by what right 
of love dared he make her strong youth a prop for 
his feeble life? She loved him he knew—in his 
blackest hour he never doubted this—but because 
she loved him, did it follow that she must be 
sacrificed?</p>
                  <p>Then gradually the dark mood passed, and 
with his eyes on the star, his mouth settled 
into the lines of smiling patience which suffering 
brings to the brave. He had never been a coward 
and he was not one now. The years had taught him 
nothing if they had not taught him the wisdom most 
needed by his impulsive youth—that so long as there 
comes good to the meanest creature from fate's hardest 
blow, it is the part of a man to stand up
<pb n="494"/>											
and take it between the eyes. In the midst of his own 
despair, of the haunting memories of that bland 
period which was over for his race, there arose 
suddenly the figure of the slave the Major had 
rescued, in Dan's boyhood, from the power of old 
Rainy-day Jones. He saw again the poor black 
wretch shivering in the warmth, with the dirty rag 
about his jaw, and with the sight he drew a breath 
that was almost of relief. That one memory had 
troubled his own jovial ease; now in his approaching 
poverty he might put it away from him forever.</p>
                  <p>In the first light of a misty April sunrise they went 
out on the road again, and when they had walked a 
mile or so, Big Abel found some young pokeberry 
shoots, which he boiled in his old quart cup with a 
slice of bacon he had saved from supper. At noon 
they came upon a little farm and ploughed a strip of 
land in payment for a dinner that was lavishly 
pressed upon them. The people were plain, poor, and 
kindly, and the farmer followed Dan into the field 
with entreaties that he should leave the furrows and 
come in to meet his family. “Let yo' darky do a bit 
of work if he wants to,” he urged, “but it makes me 
downright sick to see one of General Lee's soldiers 
driving my plough. The gals are afraid it'll bring bad 
luck.”</p>
                  <p>With a laugh, Dan tossed the ropes to Big 
Abel, who had been breaking clods of earth, and 
returned to the house, where he was placed in the 
seat of honour and waited on by a troop of enthusiastic 
red-checked maidens, each of whom cut one of the
remaining buttons from his coat. Here he was
<pb n="495"/>											
asked to stay the night, but with the memory of the 
blue valley before his eyes, he shook his head and 
pushed on again in the early afternoon. The vision of 
Chericoke hung like a star above his road, and he 
struggled a little nearer day by day.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes ploughing, sometimes chopping a pile 
of logs, and again lying for hours in the warm grass 
by the way, they travelled slowly toward the valley 
that held Dan's desire. The chill April dawns broke 
over them, and the genial April sunshine warmed 
them through after a drenching in a pearly shower. 
They watched the buds swell and the leaves open in 
the wood, the wild violets bloom in sheltered places, 
and the dandelions troop in ranks among the grasses 
by the road. Dan, halting to rest in the mild weather, 
would fall often into a revery long and patient, like 
those of extreme old age. With the sun shining upon 
his relaxed body and his eyes on the bright dust that 
floated in the slanting beams, he would lie for hours 
speechless, absorbed, filled with visions. One day he 
found a mountain laurel flowering in the woods, and 
gathering a spray he sat with it in his hands and 
dreamed of Betty. When Big Abel touched him on 
the arm he turned with a laugh and struggled to his 
feet. “I was resting,” he explained, as they walked 
on. “It is good to rest like that in mind and body; to 
keep out thoughts and let the dreams come as they 
will.”</p>
                  <p>“De bes' place ter res' is on yo' own do' step,” 
Big Abel responded, and quickening their pace, they 
went more rapidly over the rough clay roads.</p>
                  <p>It was at the end of this day that they came, in
<pb n="496"/>											
the purple twilight, to a big brick house and found 
there a woman who lived alone with the memories 
of a son she had lost at Gettysburg. At their knock 
she came herself, with a few old servants, prompt, 
tearful, and very sad; and when she saw Dan's coat 
by the light of the lamp behind her, she put out her 
hands with a cry of welcome and drew him in, 
weeping softly as her white head touched his sleeve.</p>
                  <p>“My mother is dead, thank God,” he murmured, 
and at his words she looked up at him a little 
startled.</p>
                  <p>“Others have come,” she said, “but they were not 
like you; they did not have your voice. Have you 
been always poor like this?”</p>
                  <p>He met her eyes smiling.</p>
                  <p>“I have not always been a soldier,” was his 
answer.</p>
                  <p>For a moment she looked at him as if bewildered; 
then taking a lamp from an old servant, she led the 
way upstairs to her son's room, and laid out the dead 
man's clothes upon his bed.</p>
                  <p>“We keep house for the soldiers now,” she said, 
and went out to make things ready.</p>
                  <p>As he plunged into the warm water and dried 
himself upon the fresh linen she had left, he heard 
the sound of passing feet in the broad hall, and 
from the outside kitchen there floated a savoury 
smell that reminded him of Chericoke at the supper
hour. With the bath and the clean clothes his old
instincts revived within him, and as he looked into 
the glass he caught something of the likeness of
his college days. Beau Montjoy was not starved out
<pb n="497"/>											
after all, he thought with a laugh, he was only 
plastered over with malaria and dirt.</p>
                  <p>For three days he remained in the big brick house 
lying at ease upon a sofa in the library, or listening 
to the tragic voice of the mother who talked of her 
only son. When she questioned him about Pickett's 
charge, he raised himself on his pillows and talked 
excitedly, his face flushing as if from fever.</p>
                  <p>“Your son was with Armistead,” he said, “and they 
all went down like heroes. I can see old Armistead 
now with his hat on his sword's point as he waved to 
us through the smoke.‘Who will follow me, boys?’ 
he cried, and the next instant dashed straight on the 
defences. When he got to the second line there were 
only six men with him, beside Colonel Martin, and 
your son was one of them. My God! it was worth 
living to die like that.”</p>
                  <p>“And it is worth living to have a son die like 
that,” she added, and wept softly in the stillness.</p>
                  <p>The next morning he went on again despite her 
prayers. The rest was all too pleasant, but the 
memory of his valley was before him, and he 
thirsted for the pure winds that blew down the long 
white turnpike.</p>
                  <p>“There is no peace for me until I see it again,” 
he said at parting, and with a lighter step went out upon 
the April roads once more.</p>
                  <p>The way was easier now for his limbs were 
stronger, and he wore the dead man's shoes upon his 
feet. For a time it almost seemed that the strength 
of that other soldier, who lay in a strange
<pb n="498"/>											
soil, had entered into his veins and made him hardier 
to endure. And so through the clear days they 
travelled with few pauses, munching as they walked 
from the food Big Abel carried in a basket on his 
arm.</p>
                  <p>“We've been coming for three weeks, and we are 
getting nearer,” said Dan one evening, as he climbed 
the spur of a mountain range at the hour of sunset. 
Then his glance swept the wide horizon, and the 
stick in his hand fell suddenly to the ground; for 
faint and blue and bathed in the sunset light he saw 
his own hills crowding against the sky. As he looked 
his heart swelled with tears, and turning away he 
covered his quivering face.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>XI</head>
                  <head>THE RETURN</head>
                  <p>As they passed from the shadow of the tavern 
road, the afternoon sunlight was slanting across the 
turnpike from the friendly hills, which alone of all 
the landscape remained unchanged. Loyal, smiling, 
guarding the ruined valley like peaceful sentinels, 
they had suffered not so much as an added wrinkle 
upon their brows. As Dan had left them five long 
years ago, so he found them now, and his heart 
leaped as he stood at last face to face. He was like 
a man who, having hungered for many days, finds 
himself suddenly satisfied again.</p>
                  <p>Amid a blur of young foliage they saw first 
the smoking chimneys of Uplands, and then the Doric 
columns beyond a lane of flowering lilacs. The stone 
wall had crumbled in places, and strange weeds were 
springing up among the high blue-grass; but here 
and there beneath the maples he caught a glimpse of 
small darkies uprooting the intruders, and beyond 
the garden, in the distant meadows, ploughmen were 
plodding back and forth in the purple furrows. 
Peace had descended here at least, and, with a 
smile, he detected Betty's abounding energy in 
the moving spirit of the place. He saw her in the 
freshly swept walks, in the small negroes weeding 
the blue-grass lawn, in the distant ploughs
<pb n="500"/>											
that made blots upon the meadows. For a moment he 
hesitated, and laid his hand upon the iron gate, then, 
stifling the temptation, he turned back into the white 
sand of the road. Before he met Betty's eyes, he meant 
that his peace should be made with the old man at 
Chericoke.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel, tramping at his side, opened his mouth 
from time to time to let out a rapturous exclamation.</p>
                  <p>“Dar 'tis! des look at it!” he chuckled, when Uplands 
had been left far behind them.“ Dat's de ve'y same 
clump er cedars, en dat's de wil' cher'y lyin' right flat 
on hit's back—dey's done cut it down ter git de cher'ies.”</p>
                  <p>“And the locust! Look, the big locust tree is still 
there, and in full bloom!”</p>
                  <p>“Lawd, de 'simmons! Dar's de 'simmon tree way 
down yonder in the meadow, whar we all use ter set 
ouah ole hyar traps. You ain' furgot dose ole hyar traps, 
Marse Dan?”</p>
                  <p>“Forgotten them! good Lord!” said Dan; “why I 
remember we caught five one Christmas morning, and 
Betty fed them and set them free again.”</p>
                  <p>“Dat she did, suh, dat she did! Hit's de gospel trufe!”</p>
                  <p>“We never could hide our traps from Betty,” pursued 
Dan, in delight. “She was a regular fox for scenting 
them out—I never saw such a nose for traps as hers, and 
she always set the things loose and smashed the doors.”</p>
                  <p>“We hid 'em one time way way in de thicket by 
de ice pond,” returned Big Abel, “but she spied 'em 
out. Yes, Lawd, she spied 'em out fo' ouah backs
wuz turnt.”</p>
                  <pb n="501"/>
                  <p>He talked on rapidly while Dart listened with a 
faint smile about his mouth. Since they had left the 
tavern road, Big Abel's onward march had been accompanied 
by ceaseless ejaculations. His joy was childlike, 
unrestrained, full of whimsical surprises—the flight of 
a bluebird or the recognition of a shrub beside the way 
sent him with shining eyes and quickened steps along 
the turnpike.</p>
                  <p>From free Levi's cabin, which was still standing, 
though a battle had raged in the fallen woods beyond it, 
and men had fought and been buried within a stone's throw 
of the doorstep, they heard the steady falling of a 
hammer and caught the red glow from the rude forge at 
which the old negro worked. With the half-forgotten 
sound, Dan returned as if in a vision to his last night at 
Chericoke, when he had run off in his boyish folly, with 
free Levi's hammer beating in his ears. Then he had 
dreamed of coming back again, but not like this. He had 
meant to ride proudly up the turnpike, with his easily 
won honours on his head, and in his hands his 
magnanimous forgiveness for all who had done him 
wrong. On that day he had pictured the Governor 
hurrying to the turnpike as he passed, and he had seen 
his grandfather, shy of apologies, eager to make 
amends.</p>
                  <p>That was his dream, and to-day he came back 
footsore, penniless, and in a dead man's clothes—a 
beggar as he had been at his first home-coming, when 
he had stood panting on the threshold and clutched his 
little bundle in his arms.</p>
                  <p>Yet his pulses stirred, and he turned cheerfully to the 
negro at his side.</p>
                  <pb n="502"/>
                  <p>“Do you see it, Big Abel? Tell me when you see 
it.”</p>
                  <p>“Dar's de cattle pastur',” cried Big Abel, “en 
dey's been a-fittin' dar—des look.”</p>
                  <p>“It must have been a skirmish,” replied Dan, 
glancing down the slope. “The wall is all down, and 
see here,” his foot struck on something hard and he 
stooped and picked up a horse's skull. “I dare say a 
squad of cavalry met Mosby's rangers,” he added.    
“It looks as if they'd had a little frolic.”</p>
                  <p>He threw the skull into the pasture, and followed 
Big Abel, who was hurrying along the road.</p>
                  <p>“We're moughty near dar,” cried the negro, 
breaking into a run. “Des wait twel we pass de 
aspens, Marse Dan, des wait twel we pass de 
aspens, den we'll be right dar, suh.”</p>
                  <p>Then, as Dan reached him, the aspens were 
passed, and where Chericoke had stood they found a 
heap of ashes.</p>
                  <p>At their feet lay the relics of a hot skirmish, and 
the old elms were perforated with rifle balls, but for 
these things Dan had neither eyes nor thoughts. He 
was standing before the place that he called home, 
and where the hospitable doors had opened he found 
only a cold mound of charred and crumbled bricks.</p>
                  <p>For an instant the scene went black before his 
eyes, and as he staggered forward, Big Abel caught 
his arm.</p>
                  <p>“I'se hyer, Marse Dan, I'se hyer,” groaned the
negro in his ear.</p>
                  <p>“But the others?  Where are the others?” asked
	
<pb n="503"/>											
Dan, coming to himself.  “Hold me, Big Abel, I'm 
an utter fool. O Congo! Is that Congo?”</p>
                  <p>A negro, coming with his hoe from the corn field, 
ran over the desolated lawn, and began shouting 
hoarsely to the hands behind him:—</p>
                  <p>“Hi! Hit's Marse Dan, hit's Marse Dan come 
back agin!” he yelled, and at the cry there flocked 
round him a little troop of faithful servants, 
weeping, shouting, holding out eager arms.</p>
                  <p>“Hi! hit's Marse Dan!” they shrieked in 
chorus. “Hit's Marse Dan en Brer Abel!  Brer Abel 
en Marse Dan is done come agin!”</p>
                  <p>Dan wept with them—tears of weakness, of 
anguish, of faint hope amid the dark. As their hands 
closed over his, he grasped them as if his eyes had 
gone suddenly blind.</p>
                  <p>“Where are the others? Congo, for God's sake, 
tell me where are the others?”</p>
                  <p>“We all's hyer, Marse Dan. We all's hyer,” 
they protested, sobbing. “En Ole Marster en Ole Miss 
dey's in de house er de overseer—dey's right over 
dar behine de orchard whar you use ter projick wid 
de ploughs, en Brer Cupid and Sis Rhody dey's 
a-gittin' dem dey supper.”</p>
                  <p>“Then let me go,” cried Dan. “Let me go!” 
and he started at a run past the gray ruins and the 
standing kitchen, past the flower garden and the big 
woodpile, to the orchard and the small frame house 
of Harris the overseer.</p>
                  <p>Big Abel kept at his heels, panting, grunting, 
calling upon his master to halt and upon Congo to 
hurry after.</p>
                  <p>“You'll skeer dem ter deaf—you'll skeer Ole
<pb n="504"/>											
Miss ter deaf,” cried Congo from the rear, and drawing 
a trembling breath, Dan slackened his pace and went on 
at a walk. At last, when he reached the small frame 
house and put his foot upon the step, he hesitated so 
long that Congo slipped ahead of him and softly opened 
the door. Then his young master followed and stood 
looking with blurred eyes into the room.</p>
                  <p>Before a light blaze which burned on the hearth, the 
Major was sitting in an arm chair of oak splits, his eyes on 
the blossoming apple trees outside, and above his head, the 
radiant image of Aunt Emmeline, painted as Venus in a 
gown of amber brocade. All else was plain and clean—the 
well-swept floor, the burnished andirons, the cupboard 
filled with rows of blue and white china—but that one 
glowing figure lent a festive air to the poorly furnished 
room, and enriched with a certain pomp the tired old man, 
dozing, with bowed white head, in the rude arm chair. It 
was the one thing saved from the ashes—the one vestige of 
a former greatness that still remained.</p>
                  <p>As Dan stood there, a clock on the mantel struck the 
hour, and the Major turned slowly toward him.</p>
                  <p>“Bring the lamps, Cupid,” he said, though the 
daylight was still shining.  “I don't like the long 
shadows—bring the lamps.”</p>
                  <p>Choking back a sob, Dan crossed the floor and knelt 
down by the chair.</p>
                  <p>“We have come back, grandpa,” he said. “We beg 
your pardon, and we have come back—Big Abel and I.”</p>
                  <pb n="505"/>
                  <p>For a moment the Major stared at him in silence; 
then he reached out and felt him with shaking hands as 
if he mistrusted the vision of his eyes.</p>
                  <p>“So you're back, Champe, my boy,” he muttered. 
“My eyes are bad—I thought at first that it was 
Dan—that it was Dan.”</p>
                  <p>“It is I, grandpa,” said Dan, slowly. “It is 
I—and Big Abel, too. We are sorry for it all—for 
everything, and we have come back poorer than we 
went away.”</p>
                  <p>A light broke over the old man's face, and he 
stretched out his arms with a great cry that filled the 
room as his head fell forward on his grandson's breast. 
Then, when Mrs. Lightfoot appeared in the doorway, he 
controlled himself with a gasp and struggled to his feet.</p>
                  <p>“Welcome home, my son,” he said ceremoniously, as 
he put out his quivering hands, “and welcome home, 
Big Abel.”</p>
                  <p>The old lady went into Dan's arms as he turned, and 
looking over her head, he saw Betty coming toward him 
with a lamp shining in her hand.</p>
                  <p>“My child, here is one of our soldiers,” cried the 
Major, in joyful tones, and as the girl placed the lamp 
upon the table, she turned and met Dan's eyes.</p>
                  <p>“It is the second time I've come home like this, 
Betty,” he said, “only I'm a worse beggar now than I 
was at first.”</p>
                  <p>Betty shook his hand warmly and smiled into his 
serious face.</p>
                  <p>“I dare say you're hungrier,” she responded 
cheerfully, “but we'll soon mend that? Mrs. Lightfoot
<pb n="506"/>											
and I. We are of one mind with Uncle Bill, who, when 
Mr. Blake asked him the other day what we ought to do 
for our returned soldiers, replied as quick as that, 
‘Feed 'em, sir.’”</p>
                  <p>The Major laughed with misty eyes.</p>
                  <p>“You can't get Betty to look on the dark side, 
my boy,” he declared, though Dan, watching the girl, 
saw that her face in repose had grown very sad. Only 
the old beaming smile brought the brightness now.</p>
                  <p>“Well, I hope she will turn up the cheerful part 
of this outlook,” he said, surrendering himself to the 
noisy welcome of Cupid and Aunt Rhody.</p>
                  <p>“We may trust her—we may trust her,” replied the 
old man as he settled himself back into his chair. “If 
there isn't any sunshine, Betty will make it for us 
herself.”</p>
                  <p>Dan met the girl's glance for an instant, and then 
looked at the old negroes hanging upon his hands.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, the prodigal is back,” he admitted, laughing,    
“and I hope the fatted calf is on the crane.”</p>
                  <p>“Dar's a roas' pig fur ter-morrow, sho's you bo'n,” 
returned Aunt Rhody. “En I'se gwine to stuff 'im full.” 
Then she hurried away to her fire, and Dan threw 
himself down upon the rug at the Major's feet.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, we may trust Betty for the sunshine,” 
repeated the Major, as if striving to recall his wandering 
thoughts. “She's my overseer now, you know, and she 
actually looks after both places in less time than poor 
Harris took to worry along with one. Why, there's not a 
better farmer in the county.”</p>
                  <p>“Oh, Major, don't,” begged the girl, laughing
<pb n="507"/>											
and blushing beneath Dan's eyes. “You mustn't 
believe him, Dan, he wears rose-coloured glasses 
when he looks at me.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, my sight is dim enough for everything else, 
my dear,” confessed the old man sadly. “That's why 
I have the lamps lighted before the sun goes 
down—eh, Molly?”</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lightfoot unwrapped her knitting and the ivory 
kneedles clicked in the firelight.</p>
                  <p>“I like to keep the shadows away myself,” she 
responded. “The twilight used to be my favourite 
hour, but I dread it now, and so does Mr. 
Lightfoot.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, the war's given us that in common,” 
chuckled the Major, stretching out his feet. “If I 
remember rightly you once complained that our 
tastes were never alike, Molly.” Then he glanced 
round with hospitable eyes. “Draw up, my boy, 
draw up to the fire and tell your story,” he added 
invitingly. “By the time Champe comes home we'll 
have rich treats in store for the summer evenings.”</p>
                  <p>Betty was looking at him as he bent over the thin 
flames, and Dan saw her warm gaze cloud suddenly 
with tears. He put out his hand and touched hers as 
it lay on the Major's chair, and when she turned to 
him she was smiling brightly.</p>
                  <p>“Here's Cupid with our supper,” she said, 
going to the table, “and dear Aunt Rhody has 
actually gotten out her brandied peaches that she 
kept behind her ‘jists.’ If you ever doubted your 
welcome, Dan, this must banish it forever.” Then as 
they gathered about the fruits of Aunt Rhody's labours, 
she talked on rapidly in her cheerful voice. “The
<pb n="508"/>										
silver has just been drawn up from the bottom of the 
well,” she laughed, “so you mustn't wonder if it 
looks a little tarnished. There wasn't a piece missing, 
which is something to be thankful for already, and 
the port—how many bottles of port did you dig up 
from the asparagus bed, Uncle Cupid?”</p>
                  <p>“I'se done hoed up 'mos' a dozen,” answered 
Cupid, as he plied Dan with waffles, “en dey ain' all 
un um up yit.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, well, we'll have a bottle after supper,” 
remarked the Major, heartily.</p>
                  <p>“If there's anything that's been improved by this 
war it should be that port, I reckon,” said Mrs. 
Lightfoot, her muslin cap nodding over the high old 
urns.</p>
                  <p>“And Dan's appetite,” finished Betty, merrily.</p>
                  <p>When they rose from the table, the girl tied on her 
bonnet of plaited straw and kissed Mrs. Lightfoot 
and the Major.</p>
                  <p>“It is almost mamma's supper time,” she said, 
“and I must hurry back. Why, I've been away from 
her at least two hours.” Then she looked at Dan and 
shook her head. “Don't come,” she added, “it is too 
far for you, and Congo will see me safely home.”</p>
                  <p>“Well, I'm sorry for Congo, but his day is 
over,” Dan returned, as he took up his hat and 
followed her out into the orchard. With a last wave 
to the Major, who watched them from the window, 
they passed under the blossoming fruit trees and 
went slowly down the little path, while Betty talked 
pleasantly of trivial things, cheerful, friendly, 
and composed. When she had exhausted the spring
<pb n="509"/>											
ploughing, the crops still to be planted and the 
bright May weather, Dan stopped beside the ashes 
of Chericoke, and looked at her with sombre eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Betty, we must have it out,” he said abruptly. 
“I have thought over it until I'm almost mad, and I see 
but one sensible thing for you to do—you must give 
me up—my dearest.”</p>
                  <p>A smile flickered about Betty's mouth. “It has 
taken you a long time to come to that conclusion,”she 
responded.</p>
                  <p>“I hoped until the end—even after I knew that 
hope was folly and that I was a fool to cling to it. I 
always meant to come back to you when I got the 
chance, but not like this—not like this.”</p>
                  <p>At the pain in his eyes the girl caught her breath 
with a sob that shook her from head to foot. Pity 
moved her with a passion stronger than mere love, 
and she put out her protecting arms with a gesture 
that would have saved him from the world—or from 
himself.</p>
                  <p>“No, like this, Dan,” she answered, with her lips 
upon his coat.</p>
                  <p>He kissed her once and drew back.</p>
                  <p>“I never meant to come home this way, Betty,” he 
said, in a voice that trembled from its new humility.</p>
                  <p>“My dear, my dear, I have grown to think that 
any way is a good way,” she murmured, her eyes on 
the blackened pile that had once been Chericoke.</p>
                  <p>“It is not right,” he went on; “it is not fair. You 
cannot marry me—you must not.”</p>
                  <p>Again the humour quivered on the girl's lips.</p>
                  <pb n="510"/>
                  <p>“I don't like to seem too urgent,” she returned,  
“but will you tell me why?”</p>
                  <p>“Why?” he repeated bitterly. “There are a 
hundred why's if you want them, and each one 
sufficient in itself. I am a beggar, a failure, a wreck, 
a broken-down soldier from the ranks. Do you think 
if it were anything less than pure madness on your 
part that I should stand here a moment and talk like 
this?—but because I am in love with you, Betty, it 
doesn't follow that I'm an utter ass.”</p>
                  <p>“That's flattering,” responded Betty, “but it 
doesn't explain just what I want to know. Look me 
straight in the eyes—no evading now—and answer 
what I ask. Do you mean that we are to be neighbours 
and nothing more? Do you mean that we are to shake 
hands when we meet and drop them afterward? Do 
you mean that we are to stand alone together as we 
are standing now—that you are never to take me in 
your arms again? Do you mean this, my dear?”</p>
                  <p>“I mean—just that,” he answered between his 
teeth.</p>
                  <p>For a moment Betty looked at him with a laugh of 
disbelief. Then, biting the smile upon her lips, she 
held out her hand with a friendly gesture.</p>
                  <p>“I am quite content that it should be so,” 
she said in a cordial voice. “We shall be very good 
neighbours, I fancy, and if you have any trouble 
with your crops, don't hesitate to ask for my advice. 
I've become an excellent farmer, the Major says, you 
know.” She caught up her long black skirt and 
walked on, but when he would have followed, she 
motioned him back with a decisive little
<pb n="511"/>											
wave. “You really mustn't—I can't think of allowing 
it,” she insisted. “It is putting my neighbours to 
unheard-of trouble to make them see me home. Why, 
if I once begin the custom, I shall soon have old 
Rainy-day Jones walking back with me when I go to 
buy his cows.” Still smiling she passed under the 
battle-scarred elms and stepped over the ruined gate 
into the road.</p>
                  <p>Leaning against a twisted tree in the old drive, 
Dan watched her until her black dress fluttered 
beyond the crumbled wall. Then he gave a cry that 
checked her hastening feet.</p>
                  <p>“Betty!” he called, and at his voice she turned.</p>
                  <p>“What is it, dear friend?” she asked, and, 
standing amid the scattered stones, looked back at 
him with pleading eyes.</p>
                  <p>“Betty!” he cried again, stretching out his arms; 
and as she ran toward him, he went down beside the 
ashes of Chericoke, and lay with his face half hidden 
against a broken urn.</p>
                  <p>“I am coming,” called Betty, softly, running over 
the fallen gate and along the drive. Then, as she 
reached him, she knelt down and drew him to her 
bosom, soothing him as a mother soothes a tired 
child.</p>
                  <p>“It shall be as you wish—I shall be as you wish,” 
she promised as she held him close.</p>
                  <p>But his strength had come back to him at her 
touch, and springing to his feet, he caught her from 
the ground as he had done that day beside the cabin 
in the woods, kissing her eyelids and her faithful 
hands. </p>
                  <p>“I can't do it, Betty, it's no use.  There's still
<pb n="512"/>											
some fight left in me—I am not utterly beaten so long as 
I have you on my side.”</p>
                  <p>With a smile she lifted her face and he caught the 
strong courage of her look.</p>
                  <p>“We will begin again,” she said, “and this time, my 
dear, we will begin  together.”</p>
