               <p> Private URIs using the <code>simple-pi</code> prefix are pointers to <gi>category</gi> elements in
                  the teisimple-pi.xml file. For example, <code>simple-pi:name-person</code> dereferences to
                     <code>http://raw.githubusercontent.com/TEIC/TEI-Simple/master/teisimple-pi.xml#name-person</code>
                  and would indicate that names of people have been intended to be marked. If another value in the same
                     <gi>interpretation</gi> element pointed to <code>simple-pi:PI-NotMarked</code> this would indicate
                  that these have not been marked.</p>

         <p> Although TEI Simple is designed to be very constrained, it will still allow for many choices by the
            encoder. Do they choose, for example, to explicitly identify names of people and places? Will they mark
            where spelling has been normalized? Will all the words be marked with part of speech information for
            linguistic analysis? This will affect the query potential of a corpus of texts, and cannot be done simply by
            analyzing the markup. The TEI already has extensive provision in the metadata header for describing the
            encoding decisions which have been made, but this is largely targeted at storing human-readable notes, and
            is thus not machine readable. This objective is to develop and implement an extra level of notation aimed at
            automatically profiling a text. This notation is be stored as machine-readable data in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> using the 
            <gi>interpretation</gi> element in <gi>editorialDecl</gi>. If
            mediated through a good visualizing tool, such data can alert an end user to the fact that texts in a corpus
            do or not include linguistic annotation, named entity identification, etc. They are, if you will, metadata
            about metadata. TEI Simple has not developed that visualizing tool, but it will lay the groundwork for data
            structures that routine visualizing tools can easily access and mediate, provided the data are there in the
            first place and in a machine-readable form. </p>
         <p>The TEI Simple Performance Indicators can be used in the <gi>editorialDecl</gi> of any TEI Simple document
            by pointing to the file <ref
               target="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/TEIC/TEI-Simple/master/teisimple-pi.xml"
               >http://raw.githubusercontent.com/TEIC/TEI-Simple/master/teisimple-pi.xml</ref> and the <att>xml:id</att>
            values of categories in its taxonomy. This is done by using the <gi>interpretation</gi> element, one for
            each element or aspect being recorded.
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <editorialDecl>
                  <interpretation ana="simple-pi:name-person simple-pi:PI-Linked"><p>Where present in the text names of people are marked.</p></interpretation>
                  <interpretation ana="simple-pi:name-place simple-pi:PI-NotMarked"><p>Where present in the text names of places are not marked.</p></interpretation>
                  <interpretation ana="simple-pi:date"><p>Where present in the text dates have been marked.</p></interpretation>
                  <interpretation ana="simple-pi:prose"><p>The work is primarily prose.</p></interpretation>
               </editorialDecl>  
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p> Here the private URI prefix <val>simple-pi:</val> is used before the value of the <att>xml:id</att> of the
            relevant category in the <att>ana</att> attribute of the <gi>interpretation</gi> element to point to that
            category. This should be documented with a <gi>listPrefixDecl</gi> in the TEI Simple document instance. For
            example:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
               <listPrefixDef>
                  <prefixDef ident="simple-pi" matchPattern="([A-Z0-9-]+)" replacementPattern="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/TEIC/TEI-Simple/master/teisimple-pi.xml#$1">
                     <p> Private URIs using the <code>simple-pi</code> prefix are pointers to <gi>category</gi> elements in
                        the teisimple-pi.xml file. For example, <code>simple-pi:name-person</code> dereferences to
                        <code>http://raw.githubusercontent.com/TEIC/TEI-Simple/master/teisimple-pi.xml#name-person</code>
                        and would indicate that names of people have been intended to be marked. If another value in the same
                        <gi>interpretation</gi> element pointed to <code>simple-pi:PI-NotMarked</code> this would indicate
                        that these have not been marked.</p>
                  </prefixDef>
               </listPrefixDef>
            </egXML>
         </p>
         <p>The list of category <att>xml:id</att>s of TEI Simple Performance Indicators can be seen in the XML source
